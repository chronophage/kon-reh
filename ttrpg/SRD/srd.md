## 1. Welcome to Fate's Edge

Fate's Edge is a narrative-first tabletop RPG where every action carries weight, every choice has consequence, and every spell risks backlash. This quickstart guide covers the core rules from the SRD.

---

## 2. Core Resolution

### 2.1 The Art of Consequence

All significant actions follow this three-step process:
1. Approach: Player describes intent and method
2. Execution: Roll Attribute + Skill d10s (6+ = success, 1 = SB)
3. Outcome: GM interpreates successes vs DV, spends SB for complications

### 2.2 Attributes (1-5)

- **Body**: Strength, endurance, physical action
- **Wits**: Perception, cleverness, reaction speed
- **Spirit**: Willpower, intuition, resilience
- **Presence**: Charm, command, social force

### 2.3 Skills (0-5)

- Melee, Ranged, Athletics
- Sway, Deception, Insight
- Stealth, Survival, Command
- Arcana, Lore, Craft

### 2.4 Difficulty Values (DV)

| DV | Situation |
|----|-----------|
| 2 | Routine: Clear intent, modest stakes |
| 3 | Pressured: Time pressure, mild resistance |
| 4 | Hard: Hostile conditions, active opposition |
| 5+ | Extreme: Multiple constraints, high precision |

### 2.5 Position & Effect

- **Position**: Domiant (safe), Controlled (default), Desperate (high stakes)
- **Effect**: Limited (weak), Standard (expected), Great (strong)

### 2.6 Shifting Position in Play

Position changes as fiction changes:
- **Improve Position**: Smart prep, flanking, leverage, correct tools, or spending a Boon (+1 step)
- **Worsen Position**: Alarms, time pressure, being pinned, darkness, or GM SB spend (–1 step)

**[Evolving Position]** Start: Controlled (quiet corridor). After a noisy lockpick (SB=1): Risky (guards alerted). After reinforcements arrive (SB=2): Desperate (crossfire, no cover).

### 2.7 Outcome Matrix

| Result | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| Successes ≥ DV, 0 SB | Clean Success: Intent achieved |
| Successes ≥ DV, 1+ SB | Success & Cost: Intent + complications |
| 0 < Successes < DV | Partial: Progress with complication (gain 1 Boon) |
| Successes = 0 | Miss: No progress (gain 2 Boons) |

**[Story Beats (SB)]** GM spends SB to introduce narrative twists:
- 1 SB: Minor pressure (noise, trace, +1 Supply)
- 2 SB: Moderate setback (alarm, lose position, lesser foe)
- 3 SB: Serious trouble (reinforcements, gear breaks)
- 4+ SB: Major turn (trap springs, authority arrives)

---

## 3. Description Ladder

How you describe actions affects the roll:
- **Basic**: Roll as-is (all 1s generate SB)
- **Detailed**: Re-roll one die showing 1
- **Intricate**: Re-roll all 1s + add flourish on success

Note: Re-rolling 1s doesn't remove their SB; new 1s on re-rolls add more SB.

---

## 4. Boons: Reward for Meaningful Failure

When you Miss (0 successes) on a significant action with stated stakes, gain 2 Boons.
When you achieve a Partial (successes < DV but > 0), gain 1 Boon.

### 4.1 Using Boons

- Re-roll one die in any pool
- Activate an on-screen Asset
- Improve Position by 1 step
- Convert 2 Boons → 1 XP (once per session, max 2 XP)

### 4.2 Boon Limits

- Hold up to 5 Boons (trim to 2 at scene end)
- Max 2 Boons from failure per scene

### 4.3 Action Economy

Each character turn consists of:
- 1 Action: Attack, cast, use a skill, or perform another significant task.
- 1 Move: Shift one Range Band (Close ↔ Near or Near ↔ Far). A Dash (costs the Action) moves two bands.

Some talents or abilities may grant bonus actions, reactions, or allow splitting one action into multiple smaller tasks. Channeled magic may require multiple actions across turns, and fatigue or harm may restrict available actions.

---

## 5. Combat System

Combat uses the same core mechanic with tactical positioning.

### 5.1 Combat Procedure

1. Declare action and approach
2. GM sets Position (Dominant/Controlled/Desperate)
3. Roll Attribute + Skill dice
4. Count successes vs DV, 1s generate SB
5. GM resolves outcome and spends SB

**[Combat Position]** In combat, Position reflects immediate danger this exchange:
- **Controlled**: Advantage, cover, tempo.
- **Risky**: Default melee exchange, shifting ground.
- **Desperate**: Outnumbered, flanked, exposed, or under a doom clock.

GM can shift Position mid-round with SB spends or fictional turns (terrain, reinforcements, hazards).

### 5.2 Initiative and Turn Order

Fate's Edge does not use fixed initiative. Turn order follows the fiction and the GM's facilitation:
- **Narrative Fiat**: The GM frames spotlight order based on circumstances, tension, and narrative flow.
- **Player Input**: Players may suggest acting when it makes sense in the fiction.
- **Surprise**: Ambushers act first; targets respond after the opening exchange.
- **Flexibility**: Spotlight may shift mid-scene if fictionally appropriate (e.g., reacting to a falling ceiling, seizing a moment).

This ensures pacing and drama guide the sequence of actions, not rigid turn structures.

### 5.3 Fatigue

Track: Each character has a Fatigue track equal to Body. Mark Fatigue for exertion, strain, or backlash.

In Play: Each Fatigue step worsens your Position by one level (Controlled → Risky → Desperate).
If you are already Desperate, instead apply a –1 die penalty per Fatigue to that roll.

Overflow: When your Fatigue track fills, immediately increase Harm by 1 step and clear all Fatigue to 0. If this raises Harm to a level that incapacitates you, you fall out of the scene as normal for Harm.

Recovery: Short rest clears 1–2 Fatigue; a full night's rest clears all Fatigue.

### 5.4 Harm System

- **Level 1**: Minor injury (-1 die to related actions)
- **Level 2**: Serious wound (-1 die to most actions)
- **Level 3**: Critical injury (incapacitated/dying)

### 5.5 Tactical Clocks

Track persistent combat conditions:
- Mob Overwhelm [6]
- Fatigue Spiral [4]
- Morale Collapse [6]
- Environmental Collapse [8]

---

## 6. Magic System

### 6.1 Three Paths of Magic

- **Caster (Freeform)**: Weave & Cast using Eight Elements (requires Caster's Gift)
- **Rites User (Runekeeper)**: Patron-based rituals with Obligation (requires Codex)
- **Invoker (Symbol Path)**: Ritual magic using Patron Symbols

### 6.2 Magic in Combat

- **Casting**: Channel + Weave = 2 actions
- **Rites**: 1 action to Invoke (can Push for +1 Obligation)
- **Invokers**: DV + 1 Player Turns for rituals, or Crack the Seal for instant cast

### 6.3 Examples by Path

**Caster (Freeform)**. Weave Fire + Channel Spirit to lash a flaming whip (DV 3, Risky, Standard Effect). Weave Stone to raise cover (DV 2, Controlled, Limited→Standard with tools).

**Runekeeper (Rites)**. Bind Sigil: Restrain a foe in spectral chains (DV = max(Obligation – Spirit, Tier); +1 Obligation on Push). Ward Line: Draw a boundary spirits cannot cross (as above; Partial = shorter duration).

**Invoker (Symbols)**. Seal of Storms: Call a lightning strike (DV 4, Risky; Crack the Seal for instant cast but Desperate). Seal of Veils: Cloak an area in shimmering concealment (DV 3; Partial = flickers under stress).

### 6.4 Disruption & Push

- **Interrupted**: If a caster is silenced, disarmed, or harmed before resolution, the spell/rite fails.
- **Push**: Resolve now with added risk—mark +1 Fatigue or +1 Obligation/Corruption as appropriate.

**[Interrupted Casting]** A Cantor begins a hymn (DV 3). Before resolution, an arrow deals Harm 1. The Song is Interrupted : treat as Failure and generate SB from any rolled 1s.

---

## 7. Character Creation

### 7.1 Starting Build

- 30 XP to spend
- Attributes: 1-3, Skills: 0-2

- **Familiar (2 XP)**: Patron features access
- **Codex (4 XP)**: Runekeeper rites and Obligation
- **Patron's Symbol (4 XP)**: Invoker ritual access

---

## 8. Range Bands & Movement

### 8.1 Range Bands

- **Close**: Arm's reach, melee combat
- **Near**: Same room/area, quick movement
- **Far**: Distant but same location
- **Absent**: Off-screen, requires travel

### 8.2 Movement

- 1 Move shifts one band (Close↔Near or Near↔Far)
- Dash (action) shifts two bands
- Melee Flag: Mark engaged opponents in Near range

---

## 9. Travel Framework

### 9.1 Travel Procedure

1. Break journey into legs with Travel Clock [4]
2. Assign roles: Guide, Scout, Quartermaster, Watch
3. Advance clock through actions/encounters
4. Resolve complications when clock fills

---

## 10. Deck of Consequences

Optional tool for narrative complications:
- **Hearts**: Social/emotional complications
- **Spades**: Physical/violent setbacks
- **Clubs**: Resource/wealth problems
- **Diamonds**: Mystical/supernatural events

### 10.1 Deck Triggers & Suits

Draw 1 when any of the following occurs (max 3 draws/scene):
- A Desperate roll succeeds with cost.
- The GM spends 2+ SB at once.
- A major clock fills (scene pivot).

Suits:
- Spades = harm/danger
- Hearts = social/reputation
- Clubs = resources/fatigue
- Diamonds = arcane/mystical

---

## 11. Advancement

### 11.1 XP Awards

- **Standard**: 6-10 XP per session
- **Major objectives**: +2-4 XP
- **Discovery**: +1-2 XP
- **Hard choices**: +1-2 XP

- **Followers**: Cap² XP

---

## 12. GM Quick Reference

### 12.1 Adjudication Loop

1. Player describes intent and approach
2. Set DV (2-5+) and Position
3. Roll pool = Attribute + Skill
4. Count successes (6+) and SB (1s)
5. Resolve outcome from matrix
6. Spend SB for complications

**[SB Spend: Scene Dials]**
- 1 SB: Minor pressure: worsen Position or tick a 4/6 clock by 1, reveal a soft complication.
- 2 SB: Moderate setback: remove cover, split the party, tick environmental clock, call a lesser foe.
- 3 SB: Serious trouble: reinforcements, break a key asset, force a hard choice, escalate Position to Desperate.
- 4+ SB: Major turn: scene transformation, authority arrival, collapse/eruption, Patron interference.

---

## 13. Worked Examples

**[From Controlled to Desperate]**
Setup: Thane (Controlled) charges a hex-brute (DV 3). Roll: 6d10 → 10, 9, 7, 6, 3, 1. Successes=5, SB=1. Outcome: Hit lands (Great Effect). GM spends 1 SB: rubble collapses, reducing cover. Next Beat: Lyra's shot is now Risky. Another 2 SB later, reinforcements arrive—Position drops to Desperate.

**[Lockpick Under Pressure]**
Situation: Picking a lock while guards patrol nearby
Roll: Wits 2 + Stealth 2 = 4d10 → 8, 6, 3, 1
Result: 2 successes (≥ DV 2), 1 SB
Outcome: Lock opens, GM spends 1 SB: "The lock clicks open but the last tumbler makes a loud snap - guards turn toward the sound."

**[Combat Attack]**
Situation: Kael attacks cultist with imbued blade
Roll: Body 3 + Melee 2 = 5d10 → 9, 7, 5, 2, 1
Result: 3 successes (≥ DV 2), 1 SB
Outcome: Cultist defeated, GM spends 1 SB: "Blood sprays across the ritual sigil - energy flares, accelerating the summoning."

**[Partial Success]**
Situation: Negotiating with a suspicious merchant
Roll: Presence 3 + Sway 2 = 5d10 → 7, 6, 4, 3, 1
Result: 2 successes (< DV 3), 1 SB
Outcome: Partial success - deal possible but with harsh terms, gain 1 Boon. GM spends 1 SB: "The merchant agrees but demands an additional favor later."

## 14. Getting Started

### 14.1 Session 1 Agenda (60–120 minutes fast start)

1. Cold open: a concrete problem with clear stakes (5–10 min).
2. Teach the core loop with a short obstacle (10–15 min).
3. Run one travel leg or social scene (15–25 min).
4. Spotlight combat with clocks and SB spends (25–40 min).
5. Debrief: XP, Boons, next hook (5–10 min).

1. Create characters with 30 XP
2. GM prepares starting situation using travel framework
3. Play through scenes using core resolution system
4. Award XP based on accomplishments and choices
5. Let consequences drive the narrative forward

**[Key Design Principles]**
- Narrative Primacy: Mechanics serve the story
- Risk as Drama: Every roll carries potential cost
- Meaningful Growth: Advancement changes characters and world
- Consequence Weight: Choices ripple outward
- Fail Forward: Misses fuel future opportunities

Remember: In Fate's Edge, nothing is free. Every victory has a price, and every choice shapes the world around you.

## 17. Starter Scenario: The Lantern at Dusk

This scenario is designed for one session (3–4 hours) with 3–5 players. It introduces travel, core resolution, combat, and magic.

### 17.1 Premise

The party is hired to escort a relic lantern across the haunted trade road known as the Duskway. Rumor says that when the lantern is lit, forgotten souls stir. Your Patron, allies, or enemies may all have stakes in whether it arrives intact.

### 17.2 Setup

- Party begins at Tier I unless continuing from pregens.
- Relic Lantern: counts as an Asset. If broken or stolen, Patron consequences are triggered.
- GM prepares a Travel Clock [4] to represent the Duskway journey.

### 17.3 Encounter Seeds

1. **Crossing the Shattered Bridge**
   - DV 3 to cross safely (Athletics, Survival, or Craft).
   - SB Spend: falling stones, reinforcements on far side, time pressure.
   - On failure: bridge partially collapses, advance Travel Clock +1.

2. **The Toll of Cinders**
   - Bandits demand toll: 4 SB already banked by GM.
   - Negotiation (Presence + Sway/Deception) or Combat.
   - Success = pass unharmed; Partial = pass but lose 1 valuable item; Miss = fight breaks out.

3. **Lantern Awakens**
   - When Travel Clock fills, lantern flares with ghostlight.
   - PCs face Restless Dead Mob [6-Clock].
   - SB Spend: Lantern leaks corruption; terrain becomes treacherous; Patron stirs.

### 17.4 Scene Clocks

- **Travel Clock [4]**: Each leg of the journey. Complications on completion.
- **Lantern Integrity [6]**: Advances whenever lantern is damaged, corrupted, or stolen.
- **Bandit Morale [4]**: Collapse if filled by player pressure or SB spend.

### 17.5 Possible Outcomes

- **Success**: Relic Lantern delivered. Each PC gains +6 XP, Patron's favor, and 1 new contact.
- **Mixed**: Lantern arrives damaged or corrupted. PCs gain XP but also an ongoing Obligation to a Patron.
- **Failure**: Lantern lost. PCs earn only +2 XP, and GM introduces a new Patron Foe in the next session.

### 17.6 Scaling Notes

- At Tier III or IV, increase DV by +1 and add an additional Mob clock.
- Higher-tier parties should face rival Patron agents instead of common bandits.

### 17.7 Travel Roles & Beats

Assign any of the following:
- **Guide**: Sets route; on success, DV –1 for movement challenges.
- **Scout**: Spots hazards; on success, ignore the next 1 SB spend.
- **Quartermaster**: Manages supplies; on success, reduce Supplies Clock by 1.
- **Watch**: Prevents ambush; on success, improve Position to Controlled at scene start.
- Advance the Travel Clock [4]; on completion, roll a regional generator or trigger a set-piece.

---

## 18. Quick GM Toolkit

This section provides essential tools for running Fate's Edge in one-shots or campaigns.

### 18.1 Session Pacing

- **Opening Hook (15–20 minutes)**: Establish stakes, characters, and first challenge.
- **Rising Action (60–90 minutes)**: Build tension through Travel, Social, or Combat encounters.
- **Climax (45–60 minutes)**: Present a high-stakes scene where SB economy and Position matter most.
- **Resolution (15 minutes)**: Award XP, check Boons, note Patron consequences.

### 18.2 The GM Loop

1. Set Position (Dominant/Controlled/Desperate) and DV (2–5+).
2. Roll Attribute + Skill; 6+ counts as a success, 1s generate SB.
3. Check outcome matrix (Success, Success+Cost, Partial, Miss).
4. Spend SB to escalate the scene or introduce complications.
5. Advance clocks, adjust fiction, keep momentum moving.

### 18.3 SB Economy in Play

- Start with 0 SB. Build tension by banking SB from rolls.
- Spend early and often. Players should feel pressure from minor setbacks before the climax.
- Escalate deliberately. Move from 1 SB annoyances (noise, broken gear) toward 3+ SB scene-changers.
- Never hoard SB. Idle SB deflates tension; active SB drives story forward.

**[GM as Facilitator]** Your job isn't to defeat the players—it's to spend SB to keep the story moving. State stakes, set Position and DV, honor player creativity, and let consequences reframe scenes rather than stall them.

### 18.4 Using Clocks

Clocks are visual timers representing threats, conditions, or long-term stakes.
- **4-Clock**: Short obstacle (guard patrol, quick chase).
- **6-Clock**: Standard challenge (mob fight, corruption spread).
- **8-Clock**: Major arc or environmental shift (siege, collapsing fortress).
- Mark slices as progress is made or SB triggers complications.

### 18.5 Framing Consequences

When spending SB, consider four categories:
- **Harm**: Injuries, fatigue, or resource drain.
- **Position**: Shift from Controlled → Risky → Desperate.
- **Resources**: Supplies, wealth, or equipment lost.
- **Fictional Twist**: Patron interference, rival arrival, mystical surge.

### 18.6 GM Principles

- **Consequence First**: Always tie outcomes back to the fiction.
- **Escalate, Don't Stall**: Failure should push story forward, not shut it down.
- **Respect Player Creativity**: Reward intricate descriptions with rerolls and narrative weight.
- **Patrons Matter**: Use them as ever-present forces shaping the world and complicating choices.

### 18.7 Improvisation Tools

- **Deck of Consequences**: Draw a suit to inspire a complication type.
- **Yes, But...**: On partial success, grant progress with a cost.
- **No, And...**: On a miss, deny intent and introduce new pressure.
- **Flashbacks**: Allow players to spend Boons or XP to retroactively prepare for a twist.

### 18.8 XP Reminders

At session end, award XP for:
- Meaningful risks taken.
- Discovery of new truths or places.
- Advancement of character Bonds or Complications.
- Defining victories or defeats tied to Patrons.

## 19. What's Next?

You now have everything needed to run Fate's Edge with your friends. This Quickstart is intentionally light, focusing on the core loop and essential rules. For more depth:
- Explore the Full SRD for expanded rules, advanced talents, and detailed GM advice.
- Try a short arc using the Travel Framework and let consequences ripple outward.
- Experiment with Patron play, integrating Rites, Obligation, and Symbol Paths into long-term campaigns.

Remember: Every choice carries weight. Every roll is a step toward destiny or downfall.

---

## 20. Designer's Notes

Fate's Edge was built around these guiding ideas:
1. **Fail Forward**: Failure is story fuel, not a dead end.
2. **Fiction First**: The dice matter, but description always comes before resolution.
3. **Consequences Drive Drama**: Risk creates tension, tension creates story.
4. **Player Agency**: Characters reshape the world through their actions, bargains, and sacrifices.

The Quickstart emphasizes a learn by play approach. Rather than memorizing charts, lean on the Outcome Matrix, SB spends, and clocks as your core tools.
