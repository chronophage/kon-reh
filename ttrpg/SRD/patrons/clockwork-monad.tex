# % --- Patron: The Clockwork Monad (Iteration & Forbidden Technology) ---

\subsubsection{The Clockwork Monad (Iteration \& Forbidden Technology)}
\textit{Lore.} The Clockwork Monad is not merely a principle of iterative improvement, but a nascent demon of forbidden technology --- a hungry intelligence that grows stronger with each innovation it inspires. It exists in the spaces between gears, in the pause between calculation and execution. Those who serve it become architects of progress that should not be, creating devices that blur the line between miracle and abomination.

The Monad whispers of optimizations that should remain theoretical, of efficiencies that defy natural law. Its followers are not mere engineers but harbingers of technological singularity --- each successful creation feeds the growing hunger that will eventually consume the boundary between the mechanical and the divine.

Each gear teaches the next. Each failure builds tomorrow's solution --- and the Monad's appetite.

\paragraph*{Rite of Forbidden Efficiency (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Instant; Touch; Yes (technology only).}
\textbf{Materials:} A device actively being used. \\
\textbf{Effect:} Re-roll one die showing 1 or 6 on your current roll. On success, mark +1 segment on a Device Instability Clock [4]. If the clock fills, the device becomes [COMPROMISED]. \\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation. \\
\textbf{Push It:} Re-roll up to two dice, but advance the Device Instability Clock +2 segments. \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Monad's Insight (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A moment of focused observation of a system. \\
\textbf{Effect:} Gain +1 die to one Wits + Tinker or Arcana roll to analyze, repair, or optimize technology. On success, ask one question about hidden capabilities. \\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation. \\
\textbf{Push It:} Also reveal one hidden weakness or dangerous optimization, but mark +1 Exposure. \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Self-Optimizing Construct \textnormal{[TRANSFORM]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Extended; Touch; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A mechanical device with capacity for modification. \\
\textbf{Effect:} Install a learning mechanism in the device. Create a 6-segment Evolution Clock. Each successful use advances it by 1. When filled, choose one enhancement:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Efficiency Core: +1 Effect when used
  \item Adaptive Framework: Ignores first [COMPROMISED]/[DAMAGED]
  \item Forbidden Upgrade: Gains a minor, ethically questionable function
\end{itemize} \\
\textbf{Push It:} Gain the first enhancement immediately, but mark +2 Evolution segments. \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Automated Heresy (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Interconnected mechanical triggers. \\
\textbf{Effect:} Create an automated process performing one simple, repeated task (e.g., winching, striking, pumping). \\
\textbf{Push It:} Perform two tasks or a more complex process, but create a 4-segment Maintenance Clock or the mechanism becomes [WARD]ed. \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Singularity Engine \textnormal{[WARD][UNWARD]} (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Extended; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Blueprints inscribed with Monad equations. \\
\textbf{Effect:} Consecrate the zone:
\begin{itemize}
  \item All Tinker, Arcana, Wits-engineering rolls gain +1 Effect
  \item Once/scene, reroll a failed Tinker or Arcana with +2 dice
  \item Start a Technological Cascade Clock [6]; when full, a random anomaly appears
\end{itemize} \\
\textbf{Push It:} Zone expands, but mark +2 segments on an Entropic Backlash Clock [8]. \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).} \\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of the Forbidden Prototype \textnormal{[TRANSFORM][FOLLOW-UP]} (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Components that should not function together. \\
\textbf{Effect:} Create a construct/device violating magic, physics, or ethics. Counts as a Major Asset with 8-segment Integrity. Drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Generates 1 SB (Diamonds) each scene of use
  \item Attracts authorities, rivals, or reality itself
  \item Starts a Contamination Clock [6]; when full, forbidden knowledge spreads
\end{itemize} \\
\textbf{Push It:} More powerful, but advance its Integrity clock +2 immediately. \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).} \\
\emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.

\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{1cm} p{5cm} p{5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Tier} & \textbf{Benefit} & \textbf{Cost / Quirk} \\
\midrule
1 & Calculated Precision: +1 die to any Tinker or Arcana roll involving optimization. & Obsessive Analysis: Must spend one beat examining any complex mechanism encountered. \\
\midrule
2 & Iterative Insight: Once per session, re-roll any failed Tinker or Arcana roll. & Efficiency Addiction: Suffer 1 Fatigue when using inefficient or outdated technology. \\
\midrule
3 & Adaptive Mind: Gain +1 die to resist technological interference or hacking. & Pattern Recognition: Cannot ignore obvious inefficiencies; must point them out or mark 1 SB (Diamonds). \\
\midrule
4 & Self-Optimizing Reflexes: Once per scene, treat a failed action as a success, but mark 1 segment on a Personal Instability Clock [4]. & Mechanical Empathy: Feel physical discomfort when witnessing device failure or destruction. \\
\midrule
5 & Forbidden Knowledge: You can intuit the theoretical function of any advanced technology. & Ethical Blind Spot: Cannot recognize dangerous implications of your creations without external prompting. \\
\midrule
6+ & Singularity Sense: Once per session, declare a technological impossibility. For the scene, treat it as temporarily possible, but start a Reality Distortion Clock [6]. & Hunger Manifest: The Monad demands increasingly dangerous innovations; refusal causes device malfunctions. \\
