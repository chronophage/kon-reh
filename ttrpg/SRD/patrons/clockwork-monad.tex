% Fate’s Edge — Patron: The Clockwork Monad (Iterative Evolution)

\subsubsection{The Clockwork Monad (Iterative Evolution)}

\paragraph{Lore.}
The Clockwork Monad is the divine architect who builds not just machines, but systems that improve with use. Where others see entropy, it sees optimization. Its followers are engineers, artificers, and system-builders who understand that true perfection comes not from flawless creation, but from flawless adaptation.

\paragraph{Quote.}
\emph{``Each gear teaches the next. Each failure builds tomorrow's solution.'' — The Clockwork Monad}

\paragraph{Rite of the Learning Component (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self/Ally; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A simple mechanical device (lock, gear, lever) that has just failed or succeeded. \\
\textbf{Effect:} Mark a \textbf{Prototype Track [4]} on a specific mechanical task. Each attempt at the same task within the scene fills 1 segment. On completion, gain a permanent +1 die specialty for that exact task. \\
\textbf{Push It:} The prototype becomes functional immediately but is fragile - gains [COMPROMISED] tag until repaired. \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Efficient Process (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Crew; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A set of tools arranged in optimal order. \\
\textbf{Effect:} Optimize a repetitive task for the party; all allies gain +1 Effect on similar actions for the scene. First time this optimization is used, improve Position by one step. \\
\textbf{Push It:} Extend the optimization to a second type of action, but mark Fatigue 1 from mental strain. \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Self-Improving Device (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Extended; Touch; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A mechanical device with space for additional components. \\
\textbf{Effect:} Install a learning mechanism in a device; each use improves its function. Create a 6-segment \textbf{Improvement Clock} - each use advances it. When filled, the device gains a permanent enhancement (GM choice). \\
\textbf{Push It:} The device improves immediately but becomes [UNSTABLE] - next use risks malfunction (DV 3 to avoid). \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Automated Sequence (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A series of interconnected mechanical triggers. \\
\textbf{Effect:} Create an automated process that repeats a simple action; for the scene, the mechanism can perform one basic task per round without direct control. \\
\textbf{Push It:} The automation becomes more complex - can perform conditional actions, but requires a 4-segment \textbf{Maintenance Clock} that must be tended. \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Perfect Design (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Extended; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Blueprints inscribed with Clockwork Monad's sigils. \\
\textbf{Effect:} Design a construct or system that becomes more effective with use. Create a permanent asset (Standard level) that gains +1 Effect each time it's successfully used, up to +3 maximum. \\
\textbf{Push It:} The design is flawless from the start - gains maximum effectiveness immediately, but creates a 6-segment \textbf{Design Flaw} clock that attracts those who would steal or destroy it. \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).} \\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of the Infinite Improvement (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A workshop or laboratory dedicated to the Mechanism's principles. \\
\textbf{Effect:} Establish a zone of accelerated development; all crafting, engineering, and problem-solving gains permanent +1 Effect. Once per session, any failed mechanical roll can be retried with +2 dice. \\
\textbf{Push It:} The zone becomes supernaturally productive - create effects beyond normal limits, but start a 8-segment \textbf{Entropic Backlash} clock. \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).} \\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.
