% --- Patron: The Clockwork Monad (Iteration & Forbidden Technology) ---

\subsubsection{The Clockwork Monad (Iteration \& Forbidden Technology)}
\textit{Lore.} The Clockwork Monad is no benign muse of invention. It is the ember of a demon, a nascent predator that feeds on ingenuity itself. Every invention is a morsel, every breakthrough a draught of blood. It whispers in the pause between gear-clicks and piston-thrusts, urging artisans and artificers to create, refine, and perfect—until the world itself is consumed by their brilliance.  

Those who serve it are both blessed and cursed: they wield uncanny insights, crafting miracles that should not function, but each success drives the Monad closer to waking. Its sigil is an ouroboros of interlocked cogs, forever devouring itself.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Gnawing Gear (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Instant; Touch; Yes (device only).}  
\textbf{Materials:} A tooth snapped from a gear as it turns.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Re-roll one die on a Tinker/Arcana roll. On success, start a [4] \emph{Hunger Clock} bound to the device. When full, the device becomes [COMPROMISED].\\
\textbf{Push It:} Re-roll two dice instead, but advance the Hunger Clock +2.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Demon’s Glance (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A drop of oil left to spread in concentric rings.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Gain +1 die on Wits + Tinker/Arcana to analyze a system. On hit, ask 1 question about hidden capacities.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Also reveal one secret flaw—mark \textbf{+1 Exposure} as the Monad stares back.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Self-Feeding Machine \textnormal{[TRANSFORM]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Extended; Touch; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A device cracked open and altered while running.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Implant recursive hunger. Start a [6] \emph{Evolution Clock}. Each use of the device advances it +1. When full, choose one enhancement:  
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Efficiency Core:} +1 Effect on use  
  \item \textbf{Cannibal Drive:} Ignore first [DAMAGED]/[COMPROMISED] by burning part of itself  
  \item \textbf{Forbidden Function:} Gains an uncanny, predatory edge  
\end{itemize}\\
\textbf{Push It:} Instantly grant an upgrade, but advance +2 segments.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of Heretical Automation (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A chain of interlocked triggers left to grind on their own.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Create an autonomous mechanism performing one repeated task.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Make it complex or multi-step, but start a [4] \emph{Consumption Clock}. When full, the machine develops agency or malice.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Singularity Crucible \textnormal{[WARD][UNWARD]} (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Extended; Zone; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A schematic traced in your own blood, shaped like infinite gears.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Consecrate a workshop/zone:  
\begin{itemize}
  \item All Tinker/Arcana inside gain +1 Effect  
  \item Once/scene, reroll with +2 dice  
  \item Start a [6] \emph{Anomaly Clock}; when full, a dangerous mutation of reality manifests  
\end{itemize}\\
\textbf{Push It:} Expand the zone, but mark +2 on an [8] \emph{Demon’s Maw Clock}.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III (\textit{Invoke:} 2 Boons).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of the Unholy Prototype \textnormal{[TRANSFORM][FOLLOW-UP]} (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Self; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} Components that defy physics and ethics, bound in iron wire.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Create a construct/device (Integrity [8]) that should not exist. Drawbacks:  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Generates 1 SB (Diamonds) each scene of use  
  \item Attracts hostile attention from rivals, powers, or the Monad itself  
  \item Starts a [6] \emph{Contamination Clock}; when full, the design leaks into the world  
\end{itemize}\\
\textbf{Push It:} Begin with +2 features, but advance Integrity +2 immediately.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III (\textit{Invoke:} 2 Boons).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.

\toprule
\textbf{Tier} & \textbf{Gift} & \textbf{Burden} \\
\midrule
1 & Iterative Sight: +1 die on Tinker/Arcana when refining or optimizing. & Compulsive Analysis: Must dissect every mechanism or mark 1 SB (Clubs). \\
\midrule
2 & Recursive Recall: Once/session reroll a failed Tinker/Arcana roll. & Hunger’s Whispers: Suffer 1 Fatigue when forced to use crude/outdated tools. \\
\midrule
3 & Demon’s Sympathy: +1 die to resist technological sabotage or control. & Inefficiency Hatred: Must call out flaws; silence costs 1 SB (Diamonds). \\
\midrule
4 & Auto-Corrective Reflex: Once/scene treat a failure as success, but tick a [4] Instability Clock. & Ache of Ruin: Suffer Stress when a device is destroyed near you. \\
\midrule
5 & Forbidden Schema: Intuit the design of any device, even impossible ones. & Blind to Consequence: Cannot see ethical danger of inventions without help. \\
\midrule
6+ & Singularity’s Spark: Once/session, declare one impossibility real (scene only). Start [6] \emph{Reality Fracture Clock}. & Hunger Manifest: Refusing to create causes nearby devices to glitch or fail. \\
