\subsection{Maelstraeus, The Infernal Bargainer (Pacts \& Debt)}
\paragraph{Lore.}  
Maelstraeus is whispered of as the Infernal Bargainer, the one who tallies every promise and weighs every gift. His followers insist that all power must be transacted, and no boon is free. Mortals who call him do so for leverage, not devotion — and yet every coin spent in his name is another bead on his endless abacus.  

\paragraph{Quote.}  
\emph{“Nothing is given. All is traded. You may forget the bargain, but I never do.” — Maelstraeus, The Infernal Bargainer}  



\paragraph{Rite of the Binding Quill (Low, 4 XP)} 
\emph{Scene; Near; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A drop of ink or blood upon parchment.  
\textbf{Effect:} Seal a spoken agreement in narrative force. Breaking the terms imposes a Minor Condition (Guilt, Debt, Marked).  
\textbf{Push It:} The pact is harder to break (Moderate Condition), but Maelstraeus claims a fragment of the truth surrounding the deal for his own designs.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}  

\paragraph{Rite of the Weighed Scales (Low, 5 XP)}  
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A coin balanced upon your palm until it falls.  
\textbf{Effect:} Gain +1 die when bargaining, haggling, or leveraging debts. You instinctively sense if the other side is giving more than they receive.  
\textbf{Push It:} You may demand a small hidden truth in the bargain, but you take Fatigue 1 from the mental strain of weighing it.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}  

\paragraph{Rite of the Token Exchange (Low, 6 XP)}  
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A small token given and received (coin, trinket, written word).  
\textbf{Effect:} You and the target both gain +1 die to a single roll this scene — but the GM chooses a minor narrative complication that ties you together until the “exchange” is settled.  
\textbf{Push It:} You may declare the complication instead, but the GM immediately gains 1 SB to “enforce the bargain” later.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}  

\paragraph{Rite of the Debt Ledger (Standard, 8 XP)}  
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: Yes (different debts).}  
\textbf{Materials:} A written list of names or accounts.  
\textbf{Effect:} Track a target who owes you a boon or debt. You gain +1 effect to actions to collect or enforce repayment.  
\textbf{Push It:} You may declare a “hidden clause” that retroactively complicates the debtor’s situation in your favor, but this grants GM 1 SB immediately.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}  

\paragraph{Rite of the Infernal Seal (Standard, 7 XP)}  
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Touch; Stacking: No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} Wax seal impressed upon parchment or skin.  
\textbf{Effect:} Affix a mark of pact upon an ally or foe. For allies, once per scene they may reroll a failed action tied to the bargain. For foes, the mark imposes -1 die to resist your Sway or Command.  
\textbf{Push It:} The Seal glows with infernal script, undeniable to all, but its visibility may draw unwanted attention from other Patrons.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}  

\paragraph{Rite of the Eternal Contract (High, 12 XP)}  
\emph{Extended; Range: Self+Other; Stacking: No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A signed document, sealed with both blood and wax.  
\textbf{Effect:} Forge an extended pact with another character. While active, both gain a persistent +1 die when acting in line with the contract, but each breach immediately advances a 6-segment “Debt Claimed” clock.  
\textbf{Push It:} The pact can cheat death once for one party — they revive at Harm 3 instead of dying — but the “Debt Claimed” clock jumps forward 3 segments.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}  
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.  

\paragraph{Rite of the Infernal Exchange (High, 14 XP)}  
\emph{Scene; Zone; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A balance scale with something of personal value upon each side.  
\textbf{Effect:} Exchange properties, conditions, or consequences between two willing targets. (e.g., swap Fatigue 2 for Harm 1, trade a social Condition, or move SB gain from one character to another).  
\textbf{Push It:} The exchange may include an unwilling target, but Maelstraeus claims something from you in kind — a permanent scar, memory, or name.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}  
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.  

\subsection{Maestraea, The Scarlet Temptress (Temptation \& Pacts)}

\paragraph{Lore.}  
Maestraea is invoked in whispers and perfumes, the Scarlet Temptress whose gifts are sweeter than they are safe. Where Maelstraeus weighs coins, she weighs hearts. Her followers say that no promise is without a kiss, and no kiss without a hook. She thrives on secrets confessed in candlelight and debts owed in passion.  

\paragraph{Quote.}  
\emph{“You call it a bargain, love. I call it a kiss — one you’ll never forget.” — Maestraea, The Scarlet Temptress}  

\paragraph{Rite of the Velvet Promise (Low, 4 XP)} 
\emph{Scene; Near; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A whispered vow sealed with a kiss or caress.  
\textbf{Effect:} Seal a spoken promise with allure. Breaking the terms imposes a Minor Condition (Guilt, Tempted, Marked).  
\textbf{Push It:} The promise becomes intoxicating — breaking it escalates to a Moderate Condition, but Maestraea claims a hidden desire of the target.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}  

\paragraph{Rite of the Honeyed Tongue (Low, 5 XP)}  
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A sweet taste, wine, or spice upon the lips.  
\textbf{Effect:} Gain +1 die to Sway or Performance rolls. Targets instinctively want to please you, though they may not know why.  
\textbf{Push It:} You glimpse one of the target’s secret longings, but the intimacy costs you Fatigue 1.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}  

\paragraph{Rite of the Crimson Token (Low, 6 XP)}  
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A personal token given and received (lock of hair, charm, garment ribbon).  
\textbf{Effect:} Both giver and recipient gain +1 die to a single roll this scene, but they are bound by a palpable sense of longing or obligation until resolved.  
\textbf{Push It:} You may declare the nature of the bond, but the GM immediately gains 1 SB to entangle you further.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}  

\paragraph{Rite of the Perfumed Ledger (Standard, 8 XP)}  
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: Yes (different targets).}  
\textbf{Materials:} A list of names written in scented ink.  
\textbf{Effect:} You mark a target who owes you affection, desire, or service. You gain +1 effect when exploiting that bond.  
\textbf{Push It:} You may add a “hidden clause” to the bond retroactively, but this grants GM 1 SB immediately.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}  

\paragraph{Rite of the Kiss of Chains (Standard, 7 XP)}  
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Touch; Stacking: No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A kiss, or blood upon the lips.  
\textbf{Effect:} Place a mark of temptation upon an ally or foe. Allies may reroll one failed action this scene; foes suffer −1 die to resist your Sway or Command.  
\textbf{Push It:} The mark glows faintly with infernal allure, undeniable to all, but its visibility may draw attention from rival Patrons.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}  

\paragraph{Rite of the Scarlet Covenant (High, 12 XP)}  
\emph{Extended; Range: Self+Other; Stacking: No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A shared drink, sealed with blood.  
\textbf{Effect:} Forge an extended pact of intimacy with another character. Both gain a persistent +1 die when acting in concert. Breaking faith immediately advances a 6-segment “Temptress’ Debt” clock.  
\textbf{Push It:} Pact can prevent one partner’s death (they revive at Harm 3), but the “Temptress’ Debt” clock advances 3 segments.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}  
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.  

\paragraph{Rite of the Crimson Exchange (High, 14 XP)}  
\emph{Scene; Zone; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} Two entwined tokens (rings, ribbons, locks of hair).  
\textbf{Effect:} Exchange conditions or consequences between two willing targets (e.g., swap Fatigue, a social Condition, or a boon).  
\textbf{Push It:} You may include an unwilling target, but Maestraea claims a piece of you in kind — a memory, a name, or a fragment of your soul.  
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}  
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.
