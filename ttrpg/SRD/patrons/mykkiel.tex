# % --- Patron: Mykkiel, Arbiter of the Writ (Law & Judgment) ---

\subsubsection{Mykkiel, Arbiter of the Writ (Law \& Judgment)}
\textit{Lore.} Mykkiel is the Arbiter of justice and keeper of sacred covenants, weighing speech against deed and sealing verdicts in cold iron. His sigil—balanced scales crossed by a sword—marks benches of judgment and sealed cells from the Sapphire Marches to the Sunward Courts.

Mykkiel does not merely enforce law; he embodies the principle that justice requires both mercy and judgment. Law without compassion curdles into tyranny; compassion without structure dissolves into harm. His followers learn that true authority is forged from evidence weighed, precedent applied, and oaths honored.

Name the charge. Name the terms. Then sign where you will bleed if you are wrong. The Word made manifest cannot be unsaid.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Stamp of Authority (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Cold-iron seal or writ-tag.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Project visible legitimacy. Gain +1 die to Command/Sway when asserting a lawful claim or order; challengers suffer -1 die to resist. Create a 4-segment \emph{Legal Standing} clock that can be spent to downgrade a legal complication.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} A brief hush (one beat) stills hecklers; mark \emph{Exposure} +1 as higher authorities take interest.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of Proper Notice (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Writ-string tied and snapped.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Name a lawful venue (dais, doorway, wagon). The first hostile act committed there suffers -1 die. Create a 6-segment \emph{Sacred Venue} clock protecting the designated area.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Name a protected act (parley, surrender, testimony) gaining +1 Effect in the venue; breaking custom generates 1~SB (Hearts) and marks the breaker before the covenant courts.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Writ of Compliance \textnormal{[COMMAND]} (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Instant; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Red cord knotted while speaking the order.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Issue an immediate, simple command ("Stand down," "Drop it," "Open"). Target must comply or suffer a stated cost; DV by fiction (elites may test Resolve). On success, create a 4-segment \emph{Lawful Compliance} token to auto-succeed on a similar lawful command later.\\
\textbf{Push It:} On compliance, impose -1 die on the target's next aggressive act this scene; the order sets precedent—mark 1~SB (Spades).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Speaking Seal \textnormal{[BIND]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Wax seal impressed over a name or sigil.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Sanctify a statement (truce, custody, claim). Contradictors suffer -1 die; you gain +1 die to enforce. If the seal is broken, the breaker suffers Harm~1 (Legal) and -2 dice to social rolls involving magistrates for one session. Create an 8-segment \emph{Binding Seal} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Once, ask who intends breach; the Keeper provides a strong clue or a name. Mark 1~SB (Diamonds) as truth draws covenant notice.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Oath Irons \textnormal{[OATH][WARD]} (High, 12 XP)} \emph{Extended; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Two iron pins warmed, touched to wrists, then quenched.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Bind two parties to a bounded term. Breach forces 2~SB and brands a faint iron-mark until amends. The oath is [BIND]ed to both; breaking it imposes -2 dice to all legal proceedings for one session. Create a 6-segment \emph{Sacred Oath} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Extend to a small circle (up to four), each choosing one narrow exception (Keeper approves). Exploiting an exception generates 1~SB (Diamonds) as the covenant's complexity invites scrutiny.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of the Final Judgment \textnormal{[CLEANSE][CURSE]} (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Extended; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Complete record of a case, signed by recognized authority.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Render a final, supernaturally enforced verdict. Target tests Spirit+Resolve (DV~5); on failure, full consequences apply without appeal. On success, limited appeal is possible, but the target suffers -2 dice on appeals for one arc. Create a 10-segment \emph{Divine Verdict} clock affecting all proceedings involving the target.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Make the verdict absolute and unappealable; create 2~SB (Hearts/Spades) as allies mobilize to overturn justice by other means.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\midrule
4 & Sacred Oath: Once per session, make a binding declaration so compelling that targets must make a Resolve test (DV 4) or accept it unquestioningly. & Inflexible Nature: Suffer -1 die to rolls requiring creative problem-solving or bending rules for practical solutions. \\
