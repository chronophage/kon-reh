% --- Patron: Mykkiel, Arbiter of the Covenant (Law & Zeal) ---

\subsubsection{Mykkiel, Arbiter of the Covenant (Law \& Zeal)}
\textit{Lore.} Mykkiel is the blazing sword of covenant, the Arbiter who carries both flame and oath into battle. He does not weigh from quiet benches but marches at the head of banners, binding word and deed in fire. His sigil—scales uplifted above a burning blade—flies from crusader hosts, war-tribunals, and oathbound sanctums from the Sapphire Marches to the Sunward Courts.

Mykkiel teaches that covenant is living fire, not parchment. Mercy without zeal festers into weakness; judgment without passion decays into tyranny. His followers are zealots and crusaders who bind communities by sacred flame, carrying verdicts into war and stamping oaths in iron. To break covenant under his gaze is to be seared by his fire, branded in flesh and soul alike.

Name the charge. Raise the banner. Where mercy falters, fire will march. The Covenant cannot be broken.

\textbf{Materials:} A war-banner singed in sacred flame.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Project fiery zeal. Gain +1 die to Command/Sway when declaring a righteous cause; challengers suffer -1 die to resist. Create a 4-segment \emph{Covenant Authority} clock that can be spent to downgrade a martial or covenant complication.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The banner blazes bright; mark \emph{Exposure} +1 as rival zealots or higher powers take notice.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of Hallowed Ground (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Ash, salt, or blood cast in a circle with covenant chants.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Consecrate a space (altar, gate, battlefield). The first hostile act committed there suffers -1 die. Create a 6-segment \emph{Hallowed Zone} clock protecting the area.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Name a sacred act (parley, surrender, testimony), granting +1 Effect within the zone. Breaking sanctity generates 1~SB (Hearts) and brands the violator in covenant fire.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Blazing Decree \textnormal{[COMMAND]} (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Instant; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A heated iron brand, quenched as the command is spoken.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Issue a fiery command ("Kneel," "Yield," "Confess"). Target must comply or suffer a stated cost; DV by fiction (elites may test Resolve). On success, create a 4-segment \emph{Covenant Decree} token to auto-succeed on a similar order later.\\
\textbf{Push It:} On compliance, impose -1 die on the target’s next hostile act; the decree sets precedent—mark 1~SB (Spades).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Flame-Seal \textnormal{[BIND]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Wax dripped from a torch and sealed with the Arbiter’s sigil.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Sanctify a declaration (truce, claim, sentence). Contradictors suffer -1 die; you gain +1 die to enforce. If broken, the oath-breaker suffers Harm~1 (Sacred Fire) and -2 dice to rolls with zealots for one session. Create an 8-segment \emph{Flame-Seal} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Once, ask who intends breach; the Keeper grants a clue or a name. Mark 1~SB (Diamonds) as the covenant fire hunts all deceivers.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Iron Covenant \textnormal{[OATH][WARD]} (High, 12 XP)} \emph{Extended; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Two iron spikes heated white, pressed to wrists, quenched in water.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Bind two parties in a covenant oath. Breach forces 2~SB and brands a faint iron-mark until atonement. The oath is [BIND]ed to both; breaking it imposes -2 dice to all formal dealings for one session. Create a 6-segment \emph{Sacred Oath} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Extend to a circle (up to four), each choosing one narrow exception (Keeper approves). Exploiting an exception generates 1~SB (Diamonds) as zealots and magistrates pass judgment.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of the Covenant’s Fire \textnormal{[CLEANSE][CURSE]} (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Extended; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A scroll of covenant inked in blood, burned at its edges, sealed with iron.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Deliver a searing verdict. Target tests Spirit+Resolve (DV~5); on failure, full sentence applies without appeal. On success, limited appeal is possible, but they suffer -2 dice on appeals for one arc. Create a 10-segment \emph{Blazing Verdict} clock shaping all proceedings involving them.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Make the verdict absolute; create 2~SB (Hearts/Spades) as rivals rise in rebellion against divine law.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.
