% --- Patron: Mab, Queen of Courts (Glamour & Bargain) ---

\subsubsection{Mab, Queen of Courts (Glamour \& Bargain)}
\textit{Lore.} Mab rules not from throne or blade, but from dance and debt. She is the smile that binds, the jest that ensnares, the hostess who makes guests complicit in her game. To speak in her Court is to pay; to receive her token is to owe.  

Where others rule by force, Mab rules by etiquette, glamour, and the hidden hook in every gift. Her followers thrive on charm, wit, and story, spreading webs of bargains too subtle to escape. The Cantor’s Path sings her name most sweetly, for every verse carries a price.  

\begin{quote}
Every laugh is a promise. Every promise is a debt. Every debt belongs to Mab.
