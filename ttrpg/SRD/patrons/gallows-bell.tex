% --- Patron: The Gallow's Bell (Justice & Judgment) ---

\subsubsection{The Gallow's Bell (Justice \& Judgment)}
\textit{Lore.} The Bell does not rage; it tolls. Cold and impartial, it measures all accounts in time. Its keepers are silent arbiters who weigh deeds against consequence, not out of anger but out of inevitability. To call upon the Bell is to bind oneself to the gravity of truth, where even silence is judged, and every oath leaves a resonance in iron.

\begin{quote}
What is broken must be mended, what is owed must be paid. The Bell remembers all reckonings.
\end{quote}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Measured Debt (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A pair of scales balanced with tokens from both sides.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Establish a temporary accord. Both parties suffer -1 die if they break it first. You gain +1 die to enforce compliance.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The accord is mystically weighted; breach inflicts 1~SB (Hearts).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar.}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Weighed Heart (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A small brass scale touched briefly to the chest.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Sense if the target acts against their nature or oath. Gain +1 die when pressing them.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Target must test Resolve (DV~3) or disclose a hidden conflict.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar.}

\paragraph{Rite of the Balanced Scales (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A set of scales inscribed with runes of parity.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Exchange a burden between two willing parties (Harm for Fatigue, Debt for Favor, etc.). Both gain +1 die to cooperate.\\
\textbf{Push It:} May compel an unwilling exchange with contested Command + Wits.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex.}

\paragraph{Rite of the Judge’s Eye (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A black hood worn in silence for one minute.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Detect lies within Near range; +2 dice to Insight. Liars suffer -1 die to maintain their falsehood.\\
\textbf{Push It:} All deception is laid bare for the scene, but mark Exposure +1.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex.}

\paragraph{Rite of the Final Reckoning (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A circle of iron bells, each etched with nameless runes.\\
\textbf{Effect:} The Bell tolls through you. All present feel compelled to name a debt or wrongdoing. Those who lie suffer Harm~2; those who speak true gain +2 dice to persuasion for the scene.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The Reckoning manifests as spectral echoes of past wrongs—liars automatically suffer narrative punishment (Keeper decides).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III.}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of the Great Adjudication (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Zone; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A consecrated gavel or a great bell struck three times.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Convene an unseen tribunal. Shadows of former judges and wronged souls gather to preside. For the next session, disputes within the zone are judged formally: +2 dice to Command when speaking as arbiter, and honest testimony gains +1 die.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The tribunal’s verdict echoes beyond the zone, affecting one major conflict elsewhere. Mark 2~SB (Hearts) as higher powers of judgment take notice.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III.}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.
