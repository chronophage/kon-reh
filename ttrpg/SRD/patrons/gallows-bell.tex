% PATRON — The Gallow's Bell (Revised)
% =========================
\subsection{The Gallow's Bell (Justice \& Judgment)}

\paragraph{Lore.}
The Bell tolls not just for punishment, but for the restoration of balance. Its keepers are judges of the unseen court, ensuring that debts are paid and justice flows like water—sometimes gentle, sometimes as a flood. To call upon the Gallow's Bell is to swear to uphold the weight of consequence, for the Bell sees all reckonings and demands their fulfillment.
