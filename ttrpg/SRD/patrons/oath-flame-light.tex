% --- Patron: Oath of Flame & Light (Dawn & Vows) ---

\subsubsection{Oath of Flame \& Light (Dawn \& Vows)}
\textit{Lore.} The Oath of Flame \& Light is no patron of half-measures. Its fire names, binds, and burns—demanding that those who swear within its radiance stand openly, speak truly, and pay the cost of keeping their word. At dawn altars, the sworn kindle sparks of consecrated fire; in battle, they blaze as torches that hold back the night. To follow this Oath is to live in public truth, with no shadow to hide in and no retreat from the vow once spoken.
