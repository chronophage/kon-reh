% =========================
\subsubsection{Maelstraeus, the Merchant of Equities (Exchange \& Balance)}

\paragraph{Lore.}
The Merchant moves through markets seen and unseen, ensuring that all transactions carry weight and meaning. Those who trade in his name learn that every exchange has a price, but also a reward. He is the patron of merchants, diplomats, and anyone who seeks to balance the scales of fortune. His golden scales never lie, and his ledgers record not just coin, but the weight of every promise, every debt, every obligation owed to the cosmic order.

\paragraph{Quote.}
\emph{``All things have value. All values can be traded. The Merchant sees the true price—and always collects his due.'' — The Merchant of Equities}

\paragraph{Rite of the Balanced Exchange (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}

\textbf{Push It:} Enforce the trade magically - parties cannot renege without suffering 1 SB (Hearts) and the cosmic balance demands correction—mark \textbf{1 SB (Clubs)} as the universe notes the intervention. \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Contract Seal (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; No.}

\textbf{Push It:} Make an imbalanced trade that heavily favors you, but create a 6-segment "Karmic Debt" clock that will eventually demand payment; the ledger's attention intensifies—mark \textbf{2 SB (Diamonds)} as cosmic forces take notice of the manipulation. \\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).} \\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.
