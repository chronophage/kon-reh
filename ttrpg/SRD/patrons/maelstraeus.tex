\subsubsection{Maelstraeus, The Infernal Bargainer (Commerce \& Exchange)}
\textit{Lore.} Maelstraeus is the Merchant of Equities, the Infernal Bargainer who sits at the crossroads of every transaction in the cosmos. Neither wholly demon nor angel, but a conceptual force born from the first exchange—the moment when one thing was traded for another, and debt was born.

He dwells in the pause between offer and acceptance. His realm is a vast marketplace where every deal ever struck echoes through eternity, where contracts signed in blood still hold power, and where the true price of everything is known—even if it is never spoken aloud.

Maelstraeus embodies the principle that all value can be exchanged, that every relationship is transactional, and that the universe itself operates on a vast economy of favors, debts, and obligations. His followers learn that everything has a price, but also that everything can be bought.

All things have value. All values can be traded. The Merchant sees the true price—and always collects his due.
