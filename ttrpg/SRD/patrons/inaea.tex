% --- Patron: Inaea, Angel of the Spider (Webs & Fate) ---

\subsubsection{Inaea, Angel of the Spider (Webs \& Fate)}
\textit{Lore.} Inaea sits in patient silence at the center of the unseen lattice. Where others see isolation, she sees threads—debt, affection, rivalry, loyalty—all binding mortals to each other. She is comforter and conspirator alike: the hearth-mother who eases grief with a warm hand, and the shadow-spinner who knots fates so they cannot slip free. Those who serve her learn to pull strands, tying allies closer and ensnaring foes until mercy or trap is inevitable.
