\subsubsection{Vorthak, the Withered Crown (Curse \& Blight)}
\textit{Lore.} Vorthak bears the crown of thorns, the scepter of withered grain. He is the Patron of Unnatural Endings, the one who teaches that some gifts come at a price that festers. His followers learn to weave curses that grow stronger over time, to blight what others hold dear, and to find power in decay that feeds upon itself.
