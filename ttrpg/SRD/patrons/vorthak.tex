# % --- Patron: Vorthak, the Endless Hunger (Consumption & Void) ---

\subsubsection{Vorthak, the Endless Hunger (Consumption \& Void)}
\textit{Lore.} Vorthak is the principle of absolute consumption—the void that devours not just flesh and bone, but meaning, memory, and the very threads that bind reality together. Where other patrons trade in power, Vorthak feeds. Where others bind with oaths, Vorthak consumes the need for oaths. He exists in the spaces between hunger and satisfaction, in the endless maw that can never be filled. His followers learn that to take is to become, and that in devouring the world, they risk being devoured themselves.

Feed the hunger, or let it feed you. The choice ends when the hunger begins.
