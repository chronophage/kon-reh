# % --- Patron: The Sacred Geometry (Order & Mathematical Truth) ---

\subsubsection{The Sacred Geometry (Order \& Mathematical Truth)}
\textit{Lore.} Among the Aelinnel, the Sacred Geometry is worshipped as the living mathematics of the cosmos—the divine proportion underlying every form and force. It is the principle that reduces chaos to measure, that finds the golden ratio in petals, the spiral in seashells, and the harmonic resonance in the stars. To revere the Geometry is to affirm that beneath apparent randomness lies immutable law, a lattice of perfect relationships waiting to be revealed.  

The practice of Kon'reh is no mere pastime but a sacred discipline: its board is a microcosm of creation, its pieces embodiments of force, and its strategies echoes of celestial harmonics. To master the game is to glimpse the world’s secret architecture, to intuit the pathways by which structure conquers entropy.  

The Sacred Geometry does not deny chaos; it unmasks it as illusion. Its devotees are architects of certainty in an uncertain world, mathematicians of the divine who seek to bring order where none appears. Yet those who serve it too deeply may become rigid, seeing every human choice as a problem with only one solution, unable to bear the irreducible ambiguities of mortal life.

\midrule
2 & Mathematical Precision: Once per scene, re-roll any failed logic, pattern, or mathematical reasoning roll. & Social Blindness: Suffer -1 die to social rolls involving emotional nuance or interpersonal intuition. \\
\midrule
3 & Geometric Insight: Gain +2 dice to rolls involving spatial reasoning, architecture, or geometric problem-solving. & Compulsive Order: Must organize or correct imperfect arrangements; suffer 1 Fatigue when surrounded by chaos. \\
\midrule
4 & Universal Law: Once per session, declare a mathematical principle that applies to the current situation. Gain +2 dice to related rolls, but become fixated on its perfection. & Perfectionist Paralysis: Suffer -1 die to rolls requiring quick, imperfect solutions; must find the "correct" answer. \\
\midrule
5 & Divine Ratio: Once per session, see the perfect mathematical relationship underlying any phenomenon. Gain +3 dice to understanding it, but become obsessed with its implications. & Number Fever: Suffer -1 die to rolls not involving mathematical concepts; numbers dominate your thoughts. \\
\midrule
6+ & Absolute Equation: Once per session, solve any mathematical problem or predict any pattern with perfect accuracy. For one scene, reality conforms to your calculations, but mark +2 Obligation and risk mental breakdown from cosmic truths. & Infinite Calculation: Mark +3 Obligation when using this power; become trapped in endless mathematical loops, suffering Harm 1 (Stress) until you find the solution or are interrupted. \\
