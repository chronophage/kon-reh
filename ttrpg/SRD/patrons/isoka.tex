\subsubsection{Isoka, Angel of Serpents (Transformation \& Renewal)}
\textit{Lore.} Isoka, sister to Ikasha (Shadow) and Inaea (Mercy), completes the Triad of Transformation. Where thresholds and compassion mark her sisters' domains, Isoka teaches that every self is temporary—identity is a skin to be shed so growth can continue. Her serpents are omens and teachers: each cast skin a lesson in release; each venom a catalyst for necessary change. Those who walk her path become alchemists of the self, embracing dissolution as the first motion of rebirth.

\begin{quote}
Do not mourn the skin you shed. It was never meant to last. The venom that burns away the old self is the same that grants the strength to become new.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Venomous Benediction (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A drop of serpent's venom or shed snakeskin.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Bless an ally's strike with serpentine malice. Their next successful attack this scene inflicts +1 Harm and the target must roll Resolve (DV 3) or become Poisoned (loses 1 die on physical rolls until cured).\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The venom suffuses the caster too — gain +1 die to melee attacks this scene, but also suffer -1 die to Resolve tests against fear or corruption.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Loosening Skin (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Discarded snakeskin or loose thread.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Gain +1 die to resist an ongoing Condition this scene, or reroll one \textbf{1} on an escape/evasion. On success, you may declare the Condition \emph{shed} and create a 2-segment \emph{Transformation Residue} clock to ignore a similar effect later.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Also ignore one minor movement penalty; leave a token of the old self that can be traced (mark 1~SB \emph{Diamonds}).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Subtle Shift (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Palmed trinket passed hand-to-hand.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Fluid demeanor: +1 die to \emph{Deceive} to pass as a nearby class/profession, or +1 Effect to blend into a new crowd/site. Create a 4-segment \emph{Blended Identity} clock to downgrade one social complication.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Bypass one minor identity check; you must maintain the false role to scene end (generate 1~SB \emph{Hearts} if challenged).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Shedding \textnormal{[TRANSFORM]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Full change of clothing and an adopted mannerism.\\
\textbf{Effect:} +2 dice to resist one named ongoing Condition; once/session declare a minor physical contingency retroactively ("I packed the tool," "I took that step earlier"). Create a 6-segment \emph{Shed Identity} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Clear a temporary identity-based Minor Condition; your former identity stirs in the fiction (ally, rival, or witness appears).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Forked Tongue \textnormal{[BIND]} (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self/Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A harmless lie told to a mirror.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Ambiguous persuasion: when you \emph{Sway} or \emph{Command}, a success may generate \emph{Diamonds} (leverage) instead of SB. Targets of deception must test (Wits+Insight DV~3) or suffer -1 die to future interactions with you this scene. Create a 4-segment \emph{Verbal Venom} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} One carefully worded lie this scene is treated as true; the displaced truth seeks return (mark 1~SB \emph{Hearts}).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of Complete Metamorphosis \textnormal{[TRANSFORM][WARD]} (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Identity kit (garb, voice, tokens) and a serpent's shed skin.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Full appearance/voice change. Begin \emph{Controlled} on \emph{Deceive}/\emph{Stealth}; once/scene declare a minor contingency retroactively. You are [\emph{WARD}]ed against recognition by former acquaintances. Create an 8-segment \emph{New Identity} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Spoof scent/biometric once; your original identity partially unmoors and acts independently (mark 2~SB \emph{Spades/Hearts}).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of the Cast-Off History \textnormal{[UNWARD][CURSE]} (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Burning or defacing mundane records of the old life.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Upon completion, common records and casual memories of that identity become unreliable; trackers via that identity suffer -2 dice (magic and intimates still apply). Gain +2 dice to rolls with the new identity. Create a 6-segment \emph{Erased Past} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} A plausible "death" occurs for the old identity; one intimate senses deception but cannot prove it (mark 1~SB \emph{Clubs}).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.
