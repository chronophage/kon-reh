\subsubsection{Varnek Karn, the Bone King (Death \& Unfinished Business)}
\textit{Lore.} Varnek Karn is the Archivist of the Dead, Keeper of Unfinished Business, and Lord of Necrotic Ledgers. Beneath stone and sleep lies the vast archive where every dying breath becomes a debt, every unspoken word a contract, and every unfinished task a binding obligation. Bones remember not only who died, but what they owed, promised, and wished undone. Varnek maintains the cosmic ledgers that track these accounts across lifetimes, ensuring that nothing owed to the dead is forgotten—and nothing owed by the dead goes unpaid. Many necromancers have sought dominion over the dead, only to find themselves entered into Varnek's ledgers as payment for hubris. The Bone King does not merely raise corpses; he enforces the economy of death.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Unfinished Ledger (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A binding thread tied to remains or a personal relic.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Learn one piece of unfinished business binding a spirit (name a task, debt, or oath). Acting on it grants +1 die once this scene to relevant rolls. Create a 4-segment \emph{Debt Tracked} clock.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Also learn one adversary tied to that business; generate 1 SB (Hearts or Diamonds) as the ledger cross-references your involvement.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Whispered Debt (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Instant; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A pinch of grave-dust stirred into breath.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Gain +1 die to investigate a recent death (within a day) or ask one yes/no about the cause of death and any debts incurred. If the deceased owed a debt, you may temporarily assume it (mark 1 segment on a \emph{Temporary Debt} clock [6]).\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Learn one fleeting sensory shard (sound, scent, image) about the debt's nature; mark +1 Exposure.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of Speaking Bones \textnormal{[REVEAL][BIND]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Oil the jaw; set the teeth with a sigil.\\
\textbf{Effect:} A corpse answers 2 questions about the circumstances of death from its own perspective (fragmented, literal). Max 1 corpse/scene. If it had unfinished business, you may bind it to your service (Cap 1–2), then mark 1 segment on a \emph{Ledger Attention} clock [6].\\
\textbf{Push It:} Ask a third question; the spirit's memories fracture—mark 1 SB (Diamonds) as necromantic resonance disturbs the area.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Debt Assumption \textnormal{[OATH]} (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Extended; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Sign the ledger with blood while naming the debt to be assumed.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Assume responsibility for another's unfinished business or debt. Gain +2 dice to actions fulfilling that debt, but mark 2 segments on your \emph{Personal Debt} clock [8]. If you fail to fulfill within one arc, suffer Harm 2 (Curse) and -2 dice to all necromantic actions.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Assume a greater debt for greater power; mark 3 segments on \emph{Personal Debt} and start a \emph{Ledger Scrutiny} clock [4].\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Court of Echoes \textnormal{[WARD][COMMAND]} (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Circle of bone-totems and a tolling chime.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Convene an advisory court of the dead (treat as a Major Asset clock [6]) that can: answer up to 3 complex questions, sway the fearful, or impose silence upon casual lies in the zone. All present test Spirit + Resolve (DV 3) or suffer -1 die to deception for the scene.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Command a decisive action (e.g., rout a mob, burst a door), then tick the court twice; mark 2 SB (Hearts) as spectral tensions rise.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of the Final Settlement \textnormal{[CLEANSE][CURSE]} (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Touch; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A complete accounting written in blood on bone.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Settle all unfinished business for one deceased individual. Prevents undead reanimation and ensures peaceful rest. You must pay the settlement cost—assume the debts, offer equivalent service to Varnek, or sacrifice something of equal value. Start a \emph{Settlement Complete} clock [8] that protects the area from necromantic intrusion.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Settle multiple individuals at once; the cost multiplies. Mark 2 SB (Spades) as the ledger audits your own account.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.
