\subsubsection{Mykkiel, Arbiter of the Writ (Judgment \& Writ)}
\textit{Lore.} Mykkiel weighs speech against deed and seals verdicts in cold iron. He is the Keeper of Sacred Covenants, the patron of judges, scribes, and those who would build justice upon the foundation of written law. His followers learn that every word carries weight, every signature binds fate, and every judgment echoes through the halls of eternity.

Name the charge. Name the terms. Then sign where you'll bleed if you're wrong. For the Word made manifest cannot be unsaid.

\paragraph{Stamp of Authority (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Action; Near; Yes (doc/object).}
\textbf{Materials:} Cold-iron seal or writ-tag.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Visible mark of authority. \textbf{+1 die} to \emph{Command/Persuade} that asserts lawful order/claim.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Brief hush (one beat) among hecklers; mark \emph{Exposure +1} as the seal's power draws attention from higher authorities.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of Proper Notice (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Writ-string tied and snapped.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Name a \emph{lawful venue} (dais, doorway, wagon). First hostile act there suffers \(-1\) die.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Name a \emph{protected act} (parley, surrender, testimony): \textbf{+1 effect} in the venue; breaking custom generates \textbf{1 SB (Hearts)} and marks you as oath-breaker before the sacred courts.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Writ of Compliance \textnormal{[COMMAND]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Action; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Red cord knotted while speaking the order.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Immediate command ("Stand down," "Drop it," "Open"). Target must comply now or suffer a Keeper-stated cost. DV by fiction; elites may test Resolve.\\
\textbf{Push It:} On compliance, impose \(-1\) die on target's next aggressive act this scene; the writ's authority resonates—mark \textbf{1 SB (Spades)} as the command creates legal precedents.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Speaking Seal (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Wax seal impressed over a name/sigil.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Sanctify a statement (truce, custody, claim). Contradicting it suffers \(-1\) die; you gain \textbf{+1 die} to enforce it.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Once, ask who here intends breach; Keeper gives a strong clue or direct name—the seal's truth-compelling power marks \textbf{1 SB (Diamonds)} as divine attention falls upon the liar.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Oath Irons \textnormal{[OATH]} (High, 11 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Two iron pins warmed in flame, touched to wrists, then quenched.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Bind two parties to a bounded term. Breach \emph{forces 2 SB} and brands a faint iron-mark until amends.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Extend to a small circle (up to four); each chooses one narrow exception (Keeper approves). Exploiting it generates \textbf{1 SB (Diamonds)} as the sacred covenant's complexity invites divine scrutiny.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.
