% --- Patron: Oath of Flame & Light (Paladin Archetype: Dawn & Vows) ---
\subsubsection{Oath of Flame \& Light (Dawn \& Vows)}
\textit{Lore.} Light names, binds, and burns. The Oath favors sworn keepers—those who stand in the open and keep their word even when it costs.

\begin{quote}
Speak in the light. Keep it, or the light will keep \emph{you}.

% Patron's Gift note (Paladin vibe)
\paragraph*{Patron’s Gift (Imbuement) — Paladin Flavor.}
With \textbf{Thiasos (Familiar)}, you may invoke the Gift (1 action, 1/scene) to sanctify a weapon or badge: it grants \textbf{+1 Melee} and \textbf{+1 Thematic (Command)} while your fiction honors a declared vow or protection. Push: extend one extra scene (+1 Obligation). (See \S\ref{subsec:patrons-gift}.)

\paragraph{Kindle Vow (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Action; Self/Ally; Yes.}
\textbf{Materials:} Ampoule of consecrated spark.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Name a near-term pledge this scene (\emph{hold the line}, \emph{get them out}). Bearer gains \textbf{+1 die} to actions that keep it.\\
\textbf{Push It:} First betrayal or hesitation \emph{forces 1 SB (Hearts)} on the bearer.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Lay on Hands \textnormal{[CLEANSE][HEAL]} (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Instant; Touch; No.}

\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

% --- Standard Rites ---
\paragraph{Sunlit Parley (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Vow-ring engraved with sunrise and true name.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Establish open terms: honest persuasion gains \textbf{+1 die}; deceit attempts suffer \(-1\) die in this scene’s parley.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Once, demand a public answer; evasion \emph{forces 1 SB (Hearts)} on the evader.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Purge the Shadow \textnormal{[REVEAL][DISPEL]} (Standard, 9 XP)} \emph{Instant; Near; No.}

\textbf{Push It:} Also sear a lingering tell on the source; you can sense it once again this arc; mark \textbf{1 SB (Diamonds)}.\\

\paragraph{Radiant Smite \textnormal{[FOLLOW-UP] (Standard, 8 XP)}} \emph{Action; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Consecrated spark smeared on weapon or badge.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Consecrate your next strike this scene. On your next successful \emph{melee} hit this scene:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Upgrade the hit’s \textbf{Effect} by one step (to Great if applicable), and
  \item Add \textbf{+1 Harm (Burn)} \emph{or} force \textbf{1 SB (Spades)} on the target’s side if the blow is narrative rather than wounding.
\end{itemize}
\textit{Special.} Versus Undead, Oath-breakers, or Outsiders: the blow also \emph{sears the untrue}. Undead/Oath-breakers suffer \(-1\) die on their next action; Outsiders gain \textbf{+1} segment on Leash/Exit Tally (Hit only). If the attack \emph{misses}, the smite charge lingers for one beat; after that it gutters, creating \textbf{1 SB (Diamonds)} as attention swells.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The strike flares—on hit, emit a Close burst: hostile creatures in Close suffer \(-1\) die for one beat \emph{or} are driven back (worse Position by one step). Mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\textbf{Push It:} The blaze also sanctifies the threshold (one beat of temporary \texttt{[WARD]} vs.\ oath-breakers entering).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.
