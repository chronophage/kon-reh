% =========================

\subsubsection{The Sealed Gate (Boundaries \& Closure)}
\label{patron:sealed-gate}
\textit{Lore.} You write borders into the world and prosecute trespass. Doors remember their true keepers; lines mean what you say they mean.

\paragraph{Patron's Gift (Imbuement).}
Once/scene as an action (cost: 1 Boon; requires \textbf{Thiasos}), touch an item to imbue it until scene end with \textbf{+1 Melee} and \textbf{+1 Tinker} (Thematic). \emph{Push It:} extend for one extra scene by marking \textbf{+1 Obligation}. Same-patron Gifts don’t stack; take the best. Dice bonuses respect the +3 cap.

\subsubsection*{Low Rites}

\paragraph{Seal the Threshold (Low)}
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Touch; Stacking: No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Brief sign across a door/line (chalk, wax, chain, sigil).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Mark a threshold. Crossing parties suffer worsened Position \emph{or} a brief stumble on first entry (Keeper’s choice by fiction).\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Treat the edge as difficult terrain or a snag (+1 Obligation).

\paragraph{Key’s Rebuke (Low)}
\emph{Duration: Instant; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A snapped ward-key gesture or clack of chain.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Flick a spectral hasp at a reaching hand/tool: stagger or disarm a target for one beat (fiction sets DV if contested).\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Also drop the object just beyond their reach (+1 Obligation).

\subsubsection*{Standard Rites}

\paragraph{Circle of Denial \texttt{[WARD]} (Standard)}
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Mark a ring/arc with sanctioned medium.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Outsiders crossing test \emph{DV = Cap}. On Hit: cross and add \emph{+DV} segments to their Leash/Exit Tally; on Partial: cross and add \emph{+1}; on Miss: fail to cross this beat.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Fortify the circle (harder to bypass, clearer tells) (+1 Obligation).

\paragraph{Writ of Passage (Standard)}
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Spoken naming of the route; scribed pass-mark.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Designate a path as permitted. Allies on that route gain improved flow (Position/Effect bump or ignore one level of difficult terrain).\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Extend to one extra ally \emph{or} carry across one obstacle (+1 Obligation).

\subsubsection*{High Rite}

\paragraph{Banishment Knot \texttt{[BANISH]} (High)}
\emph{Duration: Instant; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Knot of cord/chain sealed with a gate-sigil.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Target a visible Outsider. Test \emph{DV = Cap}. On Hit: add \emph{+DV} segments to Leash/Exit Tally; on Partial: add \emph{+1}; if this fills, it acts to nature once, then departs.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation} (some tables prefer +2—set at campaign start).\\
\textbf{Push It:} Strip one tether/anchor if present (+1 Obligation).

\paragraph{Invoker Access (Symbol Path).}
With a \textbf{Sealed Gate Symbol} (4 XP), perform any Rite above as a \emph{ritual} (Significant Time); completion always marks \textbf{+1 Obligation}. \textit{Crack the Seal} to cast instantly: set the Symbol to \emph{Compromised} and mark \textbf{+2 Obligation} (\textbf{+3} if High-Power). The Keeper may spend 1 on-theme SB immediately. Restore a \emph{Compromised} Symbol in Downtime via a fitting test (DV 3) or 1 XP.

\paragraph{Example Symbols (Sealed Gate).}
Lead sounder-weight engraved with abyssal curls; salt-etched iron chain link; sealed lockplate token.
