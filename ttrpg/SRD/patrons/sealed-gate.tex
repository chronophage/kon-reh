# % --- Patron: The Sealed Gate (Boundaries & Protection) ---

\subsubsection{The Sealed Gate (Boundaries \& Protection)}
\textit{Lore.} The Sealed Gate is invoked when thresholds weaken, forbidden knowledge leaks, or Outsiders press against the walls of reality. It is the Abjurist's Patron, embodying the principle that protection sometimes requires imprisonment, and safety may demand exile. Followers are warders and exorcists, but also philosophers of separation: those who believe the act of closing is sacred.

The Gate manifests as an armored figure, face hidden by a helm that shifts symbols: binding runes for warders, expulsion marks for exorcists, and an impassable refusal for transgressors.

You write borders into the world and prosecute trespass. Doors remember their true keepers; lines mean what you say they mean.

\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Treat the threshold as difficult terrain; +1 Obligation cost to cross.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Key's Rebuke (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Instant; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Gesture or chain-clack.\\

\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Drop the object just beyond reach; +1 Obligation cost to retrieve.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Circle of Denial \textnormal{[WARD]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Salt, iron filings, or blessed chalk.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Outsiders crossing test DV = Cap. On Hit: cross but add DV to their Exit Tally; on Partial: +1; on Miss: fail this beat. Create a 6-segment \emph{Boundary Integrity} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Fortify circle; clearer tells; +1 Obligation.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Banishment Knot \textnormal{[BANISH][BIND]} (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Instant; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Knot sealed with gate-sigil.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Target an Outsider; test DV = Cap. On Hit: add DV to Exit Tally; on Partial: +1. If full, entity acts once then departs; cannot return for one session. Create a 4-segment \emph{Banishment Enforced} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Strip one tether/anchor or forbid threshold-crossing in this location for one session; +2 Obligation.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\

\textbf{Push It:} Make barrier permanent/fixed; start \emph{Boundary Maintenance} [6].\\
