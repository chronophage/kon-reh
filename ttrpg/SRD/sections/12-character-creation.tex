\section{Character Creation \& Starting Build}

\subsection{Starting Build Points}
Players begin with \textbf{30 XP} to allocate during initial character creation. This represents a balanced baseline for competent starting characters.

\subsection{Enhanced Starting Builds}
Players may exceed the standard 30 XP build through narrative engagement:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Bonds:} Up to two player-defined mutual bonds may be taken for \textbf{+2 XP total}. (See bonds and bond-driven play in the core rules.)
  \item \textbf{Complications:} Up to two initial complications may be accepted for \textbf{+4 XP total}. \emph{Note:} Scenes start with \textbf{+1 banked CP per complication per character} until those complications have cleared.
\end{itemize}
This allows for a maximum starting build of \textbf{34 XP}. Players are encouraged to aim for 30 XP and use bonds/complications to mitigate slight overages while maintaining narrative balance.

\subsection{Recommended Approach}
GMs should encourage players to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Target 30 XP for balanced starting characters.
  \item Use bonds and complications to enhance characterization rather than pure mechanical optimization.
  \item Consider the narrative implications of any starting advantages.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Initial Complications (Reminder)}
For each \emph{initial complication} taken at character creation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Start each scene with \textbf{+1 banked CP} \emph{per character with initial complications} until those complications have cleared in play.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Early Talent Choices (Magic Access)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Caster’s Gift (2 XP):} Required for Weave \& Cast freeform magic.
  \item \textbf{Familiar / Thiasos (2 XP):} Required for Patron features such as \emph{Patron’s Gift}.
  \item \textbf{Codex (4 XP):} Required to fully join a Patron’s service as a Warlock (Rites access, Obligation).
  \item \textbf{Patron’s Symbol (4 XP):} Minor Asset. Grants ritual access to a Patron’s Rites via the Invoker path. One Symbol per Patron.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quick Build Guides}
\paragraph{Caster (Freeform)}
Buy \emph{Caster’s Gift (2 XP)}. Invest in Arcana-adjacent attributes/skills. Expect backlash; leverage aligned loci, tools, and prep for DV/Effect nudges.

\paragraph{Rites User (Warlock)}
Acquire \emph{Thiasos (Familiar)} and \emph{Codex (4 XP)} tied to a Patron. You can Push Rites for $+1$ Obligation. Use \emph{Patron’s Gift} for scene-long imbuement (activation: 1 action, once/scene).

\paragraph{Invoker (Symbol Path)}
Purchase one or more \emph{Patron’s Symbols (4 XP each)}. Perform Rites as rituals (Significant Time, always marks $+1$ Obligation). Use \emph{Crack the Seal} for instant casts at the cost of setting the Symbol to \emph{Compromised} and marking $+2$/$+3$ Obligation.

\subsection{Session Zero Tips}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Establish the table’s tone and stakes; tie Drives to setting fronts.
  \item Map Bonds among PCs; mark possible bond-driven Boon triggers.
  \item Seed 1--2 personal Complications per PC for early spotlight.
  \item Discuss Patron choices and what their omens look like.
\end{itemize}
