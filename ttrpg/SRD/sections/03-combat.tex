\section{Combat System}

\subsection{Core Philosophy}
Combat in Fate's Edge is not a separate mini-game; it is simply conflict under sharper focus. 
It uses the same dice pool system and SB economy as all other actions. 
The rules are designed to emphasize narrative consequence, positional play, and risk management.

\subsection{Structure of Combat}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Rounds:} Each round represents a few seconds of action.
  \item \textbf{Turns:} Each participant takes one significant action per round.
  \item \textbf{Scenes:} A battle is one scene unless the fiction dictates otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Taking Action}
On your turn, declare intent and method as normal:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Set Position:} The GM decides if you are Controlled, Risky, or Desperate.
  \item \textbf{Build Pool:} Attribute + Skill (+ gear, + assists, +1 from Imbuement if active).
  \item \textbf{Roll:} Each 6+ is a success. Each 1 generates SB.
  \item \textbf{Resolve:} Successes vs DV, SB spent by GM, Position/Effect applied.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Position \& Effect}
\begin{description}[leftmargin=1.5em]
  \item[Controlled] You act from safety or advantage. Failure still leaves you options.
  \item[Risky] Standard case. Failure has teeth, but not ruin.
  \item[Desperate] High stakes. Failure is severe; success may bring extra XP (mark Desperate use).
\end{description}

\paragraph{Effect}
Effect is narrative reach:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Limited:} Scratch or slow progress.
  \item \textbf{Standard:} Expected impact (downing a guard, disabling a lock).
  \item \textbf{Great:} Overwhelming impact, bigger than expected.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Damage \& Consequences}
When you take harm:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Level 1 Harm:} Minor injury or hindrance. -1 die to related actions.
  \item \textbf{Level 2 Harm:} Serious wound. -1 die to most actions until treated.
  \item \textbf{Level 3 Harm:} Critical injury. You are incapacitated or dying.
\end{itemize}
Harm may be resisted (roll Attribute vs DV 3; 1s generate SB). On a hit, reduce harm by one level.

\subsection{Teamwork}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Assist:} Spend 1 Stress or Boon to add +1 die. Max +3 dice from assists.
  \item \textbf{Setup:} Make a roll to improve another’s Position or Effect.
  \item \textbf{Protect:} Take harm or consequence meant for another.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GM Guidance for SB in Combat}
Use SB to escalate combat fiction:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{1 SB:} Reinforce enemy cover, minor injury, reveal new foe.
  \item \textbf{2 SB:} Reinforcements arrive, key gear breaks, enemy gains +1 die.
  \item \textbf{3 SB:} Enemy unleashes a Rite or summon, terrain shifts, ally is endangered.
  \item \textbf{4+ SB:} Scene twists—fires spread, the floor collapses, Patron omens manifest.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Combat and Magic}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Casting:} Casters spend an action to Weave and another to Cast. Requires the Caster’s Gift talent.
  \item \textbf{Rites:} Invoking a Rite is 1 action. Push may be applied for +1 Obligation.
  \item \textbf{Invokers:} May spend Significant Time for rituals or Crack the Seal for instant cast at the cost of Obligation and Symbol compromise.
  \item \textbf{Imbuements:} Require 1 action once per scene to activate, then provide +1 to one Weapon and one Thematic Skill for the remainder of the scene.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Worked Example}
\emph{Kael swings his Imbued blade at a cultist (DV 2). He rolls 5 dice: 9, 7, 5, 2, 1.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Successes = 3 (hit), SB = 1.
  \item GM grants success: cultist is cut down.
  \item GM spends 1 SB: ``Blood sprays across the sigil—energy flares, the summoning accelerates.''
\end{itemize}
