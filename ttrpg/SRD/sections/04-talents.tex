\section{Talents and Advancement}

\subsection{What are Talents?}
Talents are the building blocks of character specialization. They represent learned techniques, supernatural gifts, or cultural inheritances. 
Each Talent costs XP, and their costs are tied to impact.

\subsection{Talent Costs}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{2 XP} — Minor edge (e.g., Caster’s Gift, +1 situational bonus, small narrative trick).
  \item \textbf{4 XP} — Major edge (e.g., Patron’s Symbol, a strong summon upgrade, permanent +1 effect in a niche).
  \item \textbf{6+ XP} — Prestige abilities, rare and campaign-defining.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gaining Talents}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Spend XP earned through play. 
  \item XP comes from fulfilling Drives, resolving Arcs, trading Boons (2 Boons = 1 XP, max 2 XP/session), and GM awards.
  \item XP is spent between sessions or during downtime.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Magic Access Through Talents}
\begin{description}[leftmargin=1.5em, style=nextline]
  \item[Caster’s Gift (2 XP):] Grants access to Weave \& Cast freeform spellcasting using the Eight Elements. Without this, characters cannot freeform cast.
  \item[Familiar (2 XP):] Required to access Patron features such as \emph{Patron’s Gift}. Binds a Thiasos.
  \item[Codex (4 XP):] Required to fully join a Patron’s service as a Runekeeper. Grants access to that Patron’s Rites and Obligation system.
  \item[Patron’s Symbol (4 XP):] Minor Asset. Allows an Invoker to access a Patron’s Rites via ritual precision. Each Patron requires its own Symbol.
\end{description}

\subsection{Imbuements}
\textbf{Patron’s Gift (Free, Requires Thiasos)}\\
Duration: Scene; Range: Touch; Stacking: No.\\
Effect: Imbue one item with temporary magical power related to your Patron’s domain. The item functions as a magical weapon (+1 Melee) and specialized tool (+1 thematic Skill) for the scene.\\
Activation: Requires 1 Action once per scene.\\
Push It: The item’s power persists for one additional scene but marks +1 Obligation.\\
Requires: Familiar (Invoke: 1 Boon).

\subsection{Advancement}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Characters advance primarily through acquiring Talents.
  \item Each 8–12 XP represents significant growth.
  \item Characters may retrain (swap out) one Talent per arc with GM approval, if fictionally justified.
  \item Advancement should always reinforce narrative identity: what drives, obligations, and affinities are shaping the character?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prestige Abilities}
Prestige abilities are narrative milestones unlocked through mastery or story events. They are priced at 6+ XP and include campaign-shaping effects:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Breaking fundamental limits of casting or rites.
  \item Access to forbidden summons.
  \item Rewriting obligations or reshaping patron bargains.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Worked Example}
\emph{Sable earns 2 XP from fulfilling a Drive and 1 XP from trading in 2 Boons at session’s end. He now has 4 XP. He buys the Caster’s Gift (2 XP) and saves the other 2 XP toward a Patron’s Symbol. Next downtime, he will be able to invoke Ikasha’s rites through ritual.}
