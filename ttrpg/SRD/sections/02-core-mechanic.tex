\section{Core Mechanic}

\subsection{The Art of Consequence}

\subsubsection{Procedure}
All significant actions follow a three-step process:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Approach:} The player describes both what their character wants and how they attempt it.
  \item \textbf{Execution:} Build a dice pool equal to \emph{Attribute + Skill} and roll that many d10s. Each die of \textbf{6+} counts as a success. Each \textbf{1} rolled generates a \textbf{Story Beat (SB)}.
  \item \textbf{Outcome:} The GM interprets total successes against the difficulty (DV) of the task. Story Beats are then spent to weave narrative setbacks.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Description Ladder}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Basic Action:} Roll the pool as-is. All 1s remain as Story Beats.
  \item \textbf{Detailed Action:} A clear, descriptive flourish allows the player to re-roll one die showing 1.
  \item \textbf{Intricate Action:} A richly described, multi-sensory action allows the player to re-roll \emph{all} dice showing 1, and add one positive narrative flourish to the scene if they succeed.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Rule — Re-rolling 1s and SB}
Re-rolling 1s does not remove the Story Beats already generated by those dice. If any re-rolled dice show 1 again, they generate additional SB as normal.\\
Let $C_0$ = initial 1s, $C_r$ = 1s on re-rolls $\Rightarrow$ \textbf{Total SB} $= C_0 + C_r$.\\
\emph{Example:} You roll 7d10: \{9, 8, 5, 4, 3, \textbf{1}, \textbf{1}\} $\Rightarrow C_0=2$. You re-roll both 1s (Intricate): \{6, 2\} $\Rightarrow C_r=0$. Final: successes = 3, SB = 2 (the initial SB remain).

\subsubsection{Story Beats}
Story Beats (SB) are the engine of drama. They are not simple penalties, but narrative levers. The GM spends SB to introduce setbacks appropriate to the context:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Escalation} — drawing more enemies, raising the stakes.
  \item \textbf{Exhaustion} — draining time, resources, or positioning.
  \item \textbf{Exposure} — revealing hidden actions, alerting foes.
  \item \textbf{Collateral} — harm or danger spilling over onto allies, innocents, or surroundings.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Design Intent}
This mechanic ensures that every roll changes the story. Success without risk is rare, and even failure opens new narrative avenues.

\subsubsection{GM Quick Reference: Adjudicating Skill Checks}

\paragraph{Difficulty Ladder (set before the roll)}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{DV} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{When to Use} \\
\midrule
2 & Routine   & Clear intent, modest stakes, controlled environment. \\
3 & Pressured & Time pressure, mild resistance, partial info. \\
4 & Hard      & Hostile conditions, active opposition, precise timing. \\
5+& Extreme   & Multiple constraints, high precision, dramatic failure. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Outcome Matrix (after the roll)}
Let $S$ be successes ($\geq 6$) and $C$ be SB (number of 1s rolled).
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Case} & \textbf{Guidance} \\
\midrule
$S \geq DV$ and $C=0$ & \textbf{Clean Success}: Deliver the intent crisply. \\
$S \geq DV$ and $C>0$ & \textbf{Success \& Cost}: Grant the intent; spend/bank SB for complications. \\
$0 < S < DV$          & \textbf{Partial}: Progress with a fork. Award 1 boon \\
$S = 0$               & \textbf{Miss}: No progress. Cash/bank SB. Award 2 boons \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Critical Success}
Rolling a \textbf{10} on any die indicates a critical tier of success. Each 10 adds weight to the outcome:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{One 10:} Strong success with a free boon, improved Position, or other narrative flourish.
  \item \textbf{Two 10s:} Exceptional success; choose two benefits or a single powerful effect.
  \item \textbf{Three 10s:} Legendary success; the action transcends mortal limits and resolves the conflict dramatically.
  \item \textbf{Four+ 10s:} Mythic success; the GM and table agree the result reshapes the scene or story outright.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
If no 10s are rolled, resolve the action normally by the highest die result.

\subsection{Position}
\label{subsec:position}
\index{Position}

Every action in \indexterm{Fate's Edge} takes place from a \textbf{Position} that reflects the character’s advantage or disadvantage in the scene. Position sets the tone for the roll, narratively and mechanically. It comes in three states:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Dominant:} You act from a place of control, leverage, or overwhelming advantage.
  \item \textbf{Risky:} The standard state of play. Outcomes are uncertain but balanced.
  \item \textbf{Desperate:} You act from dire straits, cornered or overmatched, with everything at stake.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Re-roll Mechanic.}  
Position modifies the dice pool through simple re-rolls:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Position} & \textbf{Narrative Frame} & \textbf{Mechanical Effect} \\
\midrule
Dominant & You press your advantage & Re-roll one \emph{failure} \\
Risky    & The balanced norm & No re-rolls \\
Desperate & You act under duress & Re-roll one \emph{success} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{SB Spend Menu (guidance)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{1 SB}: Minor pressure: noise, trace, +1 Supply segment.
  \item \textbf{2 SB}: Moderate setback: alarm raised, lose position/cover, lesser foe or lock.
  \item \textbf{3 SB}: Serious trouble: reinforcements, key gear breaks, rail tick.
  \item \textbf{4+ SB}: Major turn: trap springs, authority arrives, scene shifts.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Assistance, Boons, \& Description}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Assists:} One helper per action; total Assist dice across sources are capped at +3 (unless a specific Talent states otherwise).
  \item \textbf{Boons:} A player may re-roll one die after seeing the pool. Once per session, in downtime, you may convert 2 Boons $\rightarrow$ 1 XP (max 2 XP via conversion per session). Hold cap: 5. Trim to 2 at scene end.
  \item \textbf{Description Ladder:} Basic (roll as-is), Detailed (re-roll one 1), Intricate (re-roll all 1s and add one flourish on success).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Boon Sharing}

Players may gift \textbf{1 Boon per scene} to an ally with a brief narrative justification.  
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Bonded Allies:} If characters share a bond, they may gift \textbf{2 Boons per scene}.  
  \item \textbf{Assistance:} Boons may be spent to enhance an ally’s roll (counts as assistance).  
  \item \textbf{Campaign Events:} Major victories or setbacks may generate shared Boons for the party.  
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Table Use:} Require a short story beat for each gift. Normal Boon limits apply. Track shared Boons openly.  
\textbf{GM Notes:} Reward generosity with extra opportunities, introduce occasional complications from dependence, and balance group vs.\ individual needs.

\subsection{Time Guidance Framework}

\subsubsection{Narrative Time Scales}
Time in Fate's Edge is measured by story weight, not by clocks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{A Moment} — A heartbeat, a glance, a single strike or word.
  \item \textbf{Some Time} — A few minutes: a skirmish, a careful lockpick, a short negotiation.
  \item \textbf{Significant Time} — Hours: travel between locations, work a ritual, endure a siege.
  \item \textbf{Days} — Large-scale endeavors: marches across countryside, training a cadre, recovery.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Game Structure Definitions}
\begin{description}[leftmargin=1.5em, labelindent=0em]
  \item[Scene] The basic unit of narrative play (Some Time to Significant Time); resolves a specific question or conflict.
  \item[Player Turn (Beat)] Declare action $\rightarrow$ GM sets position $\rightarrow$ roll $\rightarrow$ resolve outcome $\rightarrow$ manage consequences.
  \item[Round] Simultaneous or near-simultaneous actions within a scene (primarily for combat), representing a few seconds.
  \item[Session] One complete game session (typically 3–6 hours), containing 2–4 major scenes and resolving significant narrative progress.
  \item[Campaign] Entire story arc (6–20+ sessions) with major character development and lasting consequences.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Magic and Ritual Time}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Standard Casting:} Channel and Weave phases each take 1 Player Turn; resolves within a single scene.
  \item \textbf{Ritual Casting (Optional Rule):} Channel and Weave phases each require 1 Scene (Significant Time).
  \item \textbf{Rites Invocation:} Invoke takes 1 Player Turn; Weave takes 1 Player Turn. High-Power rites may require extended time by fiction.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Extended Rituals}
Attach long rituals to clocks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 4-segment clock: Significant Time (hours)
  \item 6-segment clock: Extended Time (days)
  \item 8+ segment clock: Campaign Time (weeks/months)
\end{itemize}
Advance the clock through player actions, scenes, or set intervals.

\subsection{Worked Micro-Examples}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Lockpick Under Watch (DV 2):} Roll 6 dice: 10, 8, 5, 4, 1, 1 $\Rightarrow S=2, C=2$. \emph{Success \& Cost.} Door opens; GM spends 1 SB for a squeal (patrol starts moving) and banks 1 SB to bring that patrol around on the next beat.
  \item \textbf{Charm the Captain (DV 2):} Roll 5 dice: 7, 6, 6, 2, 1 $\Rightarrow S=3, C=1$. \emph{Success \& Cost.} Passage granted; GM spends 1 SB: ``He expects a favor on the return leg—he'll collect.''
  \item \textbf{Traverse the Pass (DV 3):} Group pools to net 3 successes but produces $C=3$. \emph{Success \& Cost.} GM spends 2 SB to add Fatigue 1 to all from cold and exposure, banks 1 SB to crack a wagon axle next scene.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Fail Forward: Every Roll Matters}
When you \textbf{MISS} on a \emph{meaningful action}, you gain 2 \textbf{Boons}. When you have a \textbf{PARTIAL}, you gain 1 \textbf{Boon}. Boons can be spent immediately for re-rolls, Asset activations, Rites, and other abilities. You can hold up to 5 Boons (trim to 2 at scene end).\\
A miss only awards Boons if all three are true:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Procedure followed: intent and approach declared; DV set; roll resolved.
  \item Stakes stated: what changes on success; what bites on failure.
  \item Consequence lands now: the GM spends or banks SB, applies a condition, or advances a thread.
\end{enumerate}
Typically, failures reward boons. Rehearsal/null-risk probes and repeated identical attempts in the same scene do not award Boons. Rule of thumb, if it feels like an obvious fishing attempt, do not award a boon.

\subsection{Session Loop}

\textbf{Off-Screen (Downtime).} Clear/mark clocks, pay Upkeep, manage Obligation, craft, gather info, frame intents.

\textbf{On-Screen (Adventure).} Play scenes, make moves, trigger Rites/Casting, advance fronts.

\textbf{Wrap-Up.} Award XP, mark Story Beats (SB), resolve Harm/Fatigue conversion, advance faction clocks, note Patron Largess.

\textbf{Off-Screen Hooks.} Record next Downtime intents (projects, service to Patrons, upkeep needs) and any cliffhangers.

\subsection{Small Folk of the Threshold (Aelaerem \& Aelinnel)}
\label{subsec:small-folk-threshold}

\index{Aelaerem}\index{Aelinnel}\index{Small Folk}

The Aelaerem and Aelinnel are diminutive peoples attuned to liminal spaces and hidden ways. Their stature grants them agility and subtlety, though at the cost of bearing heavy arms or armor.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Restriction:} Cannot use \emph{Heavy Armor} or \emph{Heavy Weapons}.
  \item \textbf{Bonus:} Gain +1 \emph{Position} when Dodging or Resisting Knockback, and +1 die on \emph{Hide} or \emph{Evasion} rolls made while in cover.
\end{itemize}

Their presence in the world is often underestimated, but their knack for slipping unseen through thresholds and enduring where others falter has earned them a quiet reverence.
