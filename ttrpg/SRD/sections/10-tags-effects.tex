\section{Tags \& Effects Library}
\label{sec:tags}

\subsection{Using Tags}
Tags only function when \emph{printed on a Talent, an Ability, or as the result of a Spell/Rite}. 
They do nothing on their own. 
Unless specified otherwise, \textbf{DV is set by fiction}, and duration defaults to \textbf{Scene}. 
When a Tag affects an \textbf{Outsider}, use the unified rules in \S\ref{sec:tags-outsiders}.

\subsection{Control \& Countermagic}
\paragraph{[DISPEL] End an ongoing magical effect/construct.}
DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} dismiss/suppress per source text. \textbf{Partial:} suppress briefly or shrink scope. \textbf{Miss:} no effect.

\paragraph{[COUNTER] Interrupt a cast/rite in progress.}
Window: during the listed casting/rite window. DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} cancel. \textbf{Partial:} degrade Position/Effect or impose a cost. \textbf{Miss:} no effect.

\paragraph{[BARRIER] Create cover/obstruction.}
DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} place barrier with integrity [2/4/6]. \textbf{Partial:} narrow/fragile lane. Counters: [DISPEL], brute force, clever route.

\paragraph{[SEAL]/[UNSEAL] Lock or unlock a container/door/portal (not a spirit).}
DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} locked/unlocked; state allowed bypasses. \textbf{Partial:} short-lived/leaky seal.

\subsection{Concealment \& Revelation}
\paragraph{[VEIL] Obscure a person/thing/zone.}
DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} impose disadvantage on scans/Notice vs.\ subject; specify limits (angle, distance, scent). \textbf{Partial:} works only at range or under dim. 
Counters: [REVEAL], strong light, proof.

\paragraph{[REVEAL] Expose illusions, disguises, hidden clauses.}
DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} surface the truth/sign; say how it shows. \textbf{Partial:} a tell/clue, not the full picture.

\paragraph{[MARK] Tag a target for tracking or leverage.}
DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} place a visible/invisible mark; once/scene you or an ally gain +1 die when acting directly against the Marked target. \textbf{Partial:} noisy/short-lived. 
Counters: [CLEANSE], [DISPEL], or listed materials (salt/iron) if text allows.

\subsection{Boons \& Burdens}
\paragraph{[CURSE] Inflict a sticky hindrance with a clear release.}
DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} apply a named condition. \textbf{Partial:} milder/intermittent. Counters: [CLEANSE] or listed keys.

\paragraph{[CLEANSE] Remove/suppress a condition (poison, disease, [CURSE], fear).}
DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} remove one named affliction. \textbf{Partial:} suppress/reduce for the scene.

\paragraph{[FORTIFY] Harden a person/place/object against a vector (fire, blades, fear, sway).}
DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} raise Position or reduce consequence severity vs.\ that vector this scene. \textbf{Partial:} limited scope (one ally/doorway).

\subsection{Influence \& Oaths}
\paragraph{[COMMAND] Issue a clear order to a sapient target.}
DV by fiction (authority, leverage, fear, ritual standing). \textbf{Hit:} comply now or suffer an immediate cost (GM states). \textbf{Partial:} hesitate/bargain/partial. \textbf{Miss:} refusal/blowback.

\paragraph{[OATH] Bind parties to terms; breaking has teeth.}
DV by fiction (witnesses, sanctity, stakes). \textbf{Hit:} enforceable pact with stated boon and breach consequence. \textbf{Partial:} loophole exists. 
Counters: release clause, [CLEANSE] if text allows.

\paragraph{[SANCTIFY] Consecrate a zone to a code/patron.}
DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} specify allowed/prohibited acts; violations start Risky or impose a soft consequence. \textbf{Partial:} patchy coverage. 
Counters: opposing rite, profanation, time.

\subsection{Movement \& Making}
\paragraph{[PASSAGE] Declare a route as permitted/easy.}
DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} allies on that path gain improved flow (Position/Effect bump or ignore 1 level of difficult terrain). \textbf{Partial:} one ally/segment only.

\paragraph{[TRANSPORT] Move a target across an obstacle (blink, lift, pull).}
DV by fiction (mass, range, warding). \textbf{Hit:} relocate within listed range; state tells/costs. \textbf{Partial:} arrive off-balance, drop gear, or worse Position.

\paragraph{[CONJURE] Create a useful object/cover/hazard.}
DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} conjure item/zone with integrity [2/4/6] or a ticking hazard (burn/freeze/haze). \textbf{Partial:} fragile/short-lived. 
Counters: [DISPEL], force, time.

\subsection{Outsider-Specific Tags}
\label{sec:tags-outsiders}
\paragraph{[WARD] Challenge Outsiders crossing a warded edge/zone.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{DV = target Cap.}
  \item \textbf{Hit:} crosses; add $+DV$ segments to its Leash (or Exit Tally).
  \item \textbf{Partial:} crosses; add $+1$ segment.
  \item \textbf{Miss:} fails to cross this beat.
\end{itemize}
The ability must explicitly state it affects Outsiders (or other targets).

\paragraph{[BANISH] Drive a visible Outsider toward departure.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{DV = target Cap.}
  \item \textbf{Hit:} add $+DV$ to its Leash/Tally.
  \item \textbf{Partial:} add $+1$.
  \item \textbf{Miss:} no effect.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{[UNWARD] Unmake/suppress a [WARD] created by a Talent/Ability or Spell result.}
DV by fiction. \textbf{Hit:} dismiss/suppress per text. \textbf{Partial:} weaken/suppress briefly (about one beat). \textbf{Miss:} no effect.

\subsection{Elemental Backlash Coloring (Reference)}
On Partial/Miss (or double-1s on a Hit), color consequences by Element:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Earth} $\rightarrow$ rubble, pin, heavy footing; vs.\ \textbf{Air} $\rightarrow$ sound carries, exposure.
  \item \textbf{Fire} $\rightarrow$ burns, flares; vs.\ \textbf{Water} $\rightarrow$ slick, sputter, dim.
  \item \textbf{Air} $\rightarrow$ scatter, drop, vertigo; vs.\ \textbf{Earth} $\rightarrow$ stuck, dust choke.
  \item \textbf{Water} $\rightarrow$ leak, flood, cold drag; vs.\ \textbf{Fire} $\rightarrow$ smoke, shorted gear.
  \item \textbf{Fate} $\rightarrow$ options close, only-one-way; vs.\ \textbf{Luck} $\rightarrow$ mischance hits ally.
  \item \textbf{Luck} $\rightarrow$ side-effect elsewhere, fragile success; vs.\ \textbf{Fate} $\rightarrow$ harsher fixed outcome.
  \item \textbf{Life} $\rightarrow$ overgrowth, fever; vs.\ \textbf{Death/Dreams} $\rightarrow$ numbness, sleep-tug.
  \item \textbf{Death/Dreams} $\rightarrow$ fade, threshold opens/closes; vs.\ \textbf{Life} $\rightarrow$ pain returns, rot.
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Stacking \& Duration Rules (Global)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{No Same-Source Stacking:} Multiple scene-long effects from the same source do not stack; take the best instance.
  \item \textbf{Identical Tag Collision:} If two abilities would grant the same Tag in the same window, use the stronger; the weaker is suppressed while it lasts.
  \item \textbf{Default Duration:} Scene, unless a source states otherwise.
  \item \textbf{DV by Fiction:} Potency, preparation, place, materials, and opposition set DV (typ.\ 2--4; 5+ for set-pieces).
\end{itemize}
