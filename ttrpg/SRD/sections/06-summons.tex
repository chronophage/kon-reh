\section{Summoning (Pact-Whisperer)}
\label{subsec:summoning}

Summoning is the disciplined art of calling and binding Outsiders for temporary aid.  
This path requires the \textbf{Pact-Whisperer} Talent (2 XP).  
Each summoned being is restrained by a metaphysical tether called a \textit{Leash}, representing the summoner’s control and the strain of sustaining the bond.

\paragraph{Talents \& Access.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Lesser Pactwright:} You may \emph{Call} spirits of \textbf{Cap~1}.
  \item \textbf{Greater Pactwright:} You may also \emph{Call} spirits of \textbf{Cap~3}.
  \item \textbf{Dual Pactwright:} With both Lesser and Greater Pactwright, you may maintain one spirit of each Cap simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

\begin{fatebox}[Summoning Core Mechanics]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Mechanic} & \textbf{Description and Requirements} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Call} & 1 Action to manifest the spirit at \textit{Near} range; choose a Spirit Template aligned to fiction or Patron domain. \\
\textbf{Bind} & Spend 1 Boon \emph{or} mark 1 Fatigue to establish initial control. \\
\textbf{Leash} & Set Leash = \textbf{Cap + Command} segments.  
(\textit{Cap} is the Outsider’s tier: Cap~1 for Lesser, Cap~3 for Greater.) \\
\textbf{Tick Leash} & Whenever the spirit takes Harm, you command it against its nature, you split focus, a rival contests it, it moves \textit{Close → Far} rapidly, or crosses a \texttt{[WARD]} (\textit{DV = Cap}). \\
\textbf{Departure} & When the Leash fills, the spirit acts to its nature once, then departs (or turns hostile at GM discretion). \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\paragraph{Procedure.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Call (1 Action):} A spirit manifests at \textit{Near}. Choose a Spirit Template appropriate to the scene or Patron.
  \item \textbf{Bind:} Spend 1 Boon \emph{or} mark 1 Fatigue to anchor the connection.
  \item \textbf{Leash:} Record Leash = \textbf{Cap + Command} segments. Draw a clock to track strain.
  \item \textbf{Command:} Each round, issuing a meaningful order uses your Action. Commands contrary to the spirit’s nature tick the Leash.
  \item \textbf{Maintain:} If you split focus or perform other significant actions while it acts on your order, tick the Leash.
  \item \textbf{Departure:} When the Leash fills, the spirit acts to its nature once, then departs. Use this to escalate or reveal consequences.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Economy \& Limits.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Boon Finesse:} Once per round, spend 1 Boon to clear 1 Leash tick (before it fills). Represents appeasement or renewed focus.
  \item \textbf{Action Economy:} Issuing commands uses your Action; most spirits act immediately after their summoner.
  \item \textbf{Concurrency:} Only one active summoned spirit at a time unless a Talent states otherwise. Exceeding this limit inflicts 1 Fatigue per extra Cap point.
  \item \textbf{Downtime:} All summons end at Downtime unless explicitly sustained by a Rite or Asset.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example.}
\textit{Kestra calls a Cap~3 fire elemental to aid in battle. She spends 1 Boon to Bind it.  
The elemental’s Leash is 7 segments (3~+~Command~4). When it takes Harm, the GM ticks the Leash. Later, Kestra splits focus to issue orders while attacking, ticking again.  
Careful management and Boon Finesse keep the bond stable—until the elemental’s fury tests her will.}
