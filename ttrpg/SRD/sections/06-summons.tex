\section{Summoning (Pact-Whisperer) }
\label{subsec:summoning}

Summoning is the disciplined art of calling and binding Outsiders for temporary aid.  
This path requires the \textbf{Pact-Whisperer} Talent (2 XP).  
Each summoned being is restrained by a metaphysical tether called a \textit{Leash}, representing the summoner's control and the strain of sustaining the bond.

\paragraph*{Talents \& Access.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Lesser Pactwright:} You may \emph{Call} spirits of \textbf{Cap~1}.
  \item \textbf{Greater Pactwright:} You may also \emph{Call} spirits of \textbf{Cap~3}.
  \item \textbf{Dual Pactwright:} With both Lesser and Greater Pactwright, you may maintain one spirit of each Cap simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

\begin{fatebox}[Summoning Core Mechanics]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Mechanic} & \textbf{Description and Requirements} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Call} & \emph{1 Action} to manifest the spirit at \textit{Near} range; choose a Spirit Template aligned to fiction or Patron domain. \\
\textbf{Bind} & Spend 1 Boon \emph{or} mark 1 Fatigue to establish initial control. \\
\textbf{Leash Capacity} & Set Leash Capacity $=$ \textbf{Cap $+$ Spirit} \emph{segments}. \\
& (\textit{Cap} is the Outsider's tier: Cap~1 for Lesser, Cap~3 for Greater.) \\
\textbf{Tick Leash} & Whenever the spirit takes Harm; you command it against its nature; you perform a separate concentration-requiring action while commanding it; a rival contests its actions; or it crosses a \texttt{[WARD]} successfully \big($\mathrm{DV}=\mathrm{Cap}$\big). \\
\textbf{Departure} & When the Leash fills, the spirit acts to its nature once, then departs (or turns hostile at GM discretion). \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\paragraph*{Spirit Bond Progression.}
Each spirit you summon regularly can develop a \textbf{Spirit Bond Clock [4]}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mark segments for successful commands, shared victories, or acts of mutual aid.
  \item At 2 segments: +1 die to communicate with this spirit type.
  \item At 4 segments: Spirit grants +1 Boon when departing naturally and becomes \textbf{Favored} (Leash reduced by 1).
  \item Reset: Spirit departs as ally and may return in future scenes with +1 Effect.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Near-Miss Progress.}
If a \emph{Call/Bind} fails or a spirit departs immediately after manifesting, mark \textbf{+1} on that spirit type's \textbf{Spirit Bond Clock} once per session (per spirit type), provided a meaningful attempt was made in-scene.

\paragraph*{Spirit Specialization Paths.}
Spirits can develop specialized capabilities through repeated summoning:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Combat Specialist:} +1 Harm in melee; ignore first Harm when attacking.
  \item \textbf{Scout Form:} Extended range, stealth bonuses, can carry small items. \textit{Carry limits:} Cap~1 up to \textbf{2\,kg} (5\,lb); Cap~3 up to \textbf{10\,kg} (22\,lb). Dragging (not lifting) allows up to \textbf{3$\times$} these amounts across smooth ground. Overburdening immediately ticks the Leash.
  \item \textbf{Utility Spirit:} Perform simple tasks (lockpicking, carrying, environmental interaction).
  \item \textbf{Shield Guardian:} Interpose to protect allies; convert Harm to Fatigue.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Procedure.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Call (1 Action):} A spirit manifests at \textit{Near}. Choose a Spirit Template appropriate to the scene or Patron.
  \item \textbf{Bind:} Spend 1 Boon \emph{or} mark 1 Fatigue to anchor the connection.
  \item \textbf{Leash Capacity:} Record Leash Capacity $=$ \textbf{Cap $+$ Spirit} \emph{segments}. Draw a clock to track strain (the Leash).
  \item \textbf{Command:} Each round, issuing a meaningful order uses your Action. Commands contrary to the spirit's nature tick the Leash.
  \item \textbf{Maintain:} If you perform a separate action requiring concentration (e.g., casting a spell, picking a lock) while actively directing the spirit's complex actions, tick the Leash.
  \item \textbf{Departure:} When the Leash fills, the spirit acts to its nature once, then departs. Use this to escalate or reveal consequences.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Enhanced Action Economy.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Spirit Assist:} Once per scene, the spirit can grant +2 dice to an ally's roll instead of acting.
  \item \textbf{Quick Command:} Simple commands (attack, move, defend) do not require a full Action for the summoner.
  \item \textbf{Spirit Resonance:} When commanding multiple spirits of the same type, +1 Effect.
  \item \textbf{Honorable Departure:} Voluntarily end a summon early to gain +1 Boon and reduce Leash by 2.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Quick Command Examples.}
The following orders qualify as \emph{Quick Command} and do not consume the summoner's full Action:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Strike Nearest:} Attack the closest hostile.
  \item \textbf{Hold the Line:} Defend a doorway/ally; intercept the next entrant.
  \item \textbf{Relocate:} Move to that ledge/cover/marker within \textit{Near}.
  \item \textbf{Retrieve:} Fetch a dropped item within \textit{Near} and return.
  \item \textbf{Screen:} Impose disadvantage on the next hostile advance (tick Leash if against nature).
  \item \textbf{Scout Peek:} Look into the next room/corridor and report (no lingering).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Economy \& Limits.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Boon Finesse:} Once per round, spend 1 Boon to clear 1 Leash tick (before it fills). Represents appeasement or renewed focus.
  \item \textbf{Action Economy:} Issuing commands uses your Action; most spirits act immediately after the command is given. Quick Commands do not use your Action.
  \item \textbf{Concurrency:} Only one active summoned spirit at a time unless a Talent states otherwise. Exceeding this limit inflicts 1 Fatigue per extra Cap point.
  \item \textbf{Downtime:} All summons end at Downtime unless explicitly sustained by a Rite or Asset.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Spirit Synergy (4 XP).}\\
\textbf{Requirements:} Pact-Whisperer, Lesser Pactwright.\\
\textbf{Effect:} When commanding two or more spirits simultaneously, reduce each Leash by 1 segment and gain +1 die to Command rolls.

\paragraph*{Bonded Summoner (3 XP).}\\
\textbf{Requirements:} Pact-Whisperer, Spirit Bond Clock at 2+ segments with any spirit type.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Favored spirits reduce their Leash cost by 2 (minimum 3). Once per session, recall a departed Favored spirit by spending 2 Boons.

\paragraph*{Example.}
\textit{Kestra calls a Cap~3 fire elemental to aid in battle. She spends 1 Boon to Bind it.  
The elemental's Leash Capacity is 7 segments (\textit{Cap}~3 $+$ \textit{Spirit}~4). When it takes Harm, the GM ticks the Leash. Later, Kestra casts a spell while directing the elemental, ticking the Leash again for splitting focus.  
Careful management and Boon Finesse keep the bond stable---until the elemental's fury tests her will. After the battle, she marks her Spirit Bond Clock +1 for the shared victory.}
