\subsection{Summoners (Pact-Whisperer)}
\label{subsec:summoners}

Summoners call and direct spirits through living covenants.  
Each entity is restrained by a metaphysical tether called a \textit{Leash}, representing the summoner’s ability to sustain its will and contain its power.

\paragraph{Talents \& Access.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Lesser Pactwright:} You may \emph{Call} spirits of \textbf{Cap~1}.
  \item \textbf{Greater Pactwright:} You may also \emph{Call} spirits of \textbf{Cap~3}.
  \item \textbf{Dual Pactwright:} With both Lesser and Greater Pactwright, you may maintain one spirit of each Cap simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Core Procedure.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Call (1 action):} A spirit manifests at \textit{Near}. Choose an appropriate Spirit Template based on fiction or Patron domain.
  \item \textbf{Bind (no extra roll):} Choose one cost: spend \textbf{1 Boon} \emph{or} mark \textbf{1 Fatigue}.
  \item \textbf{Leash:} Set \textit{Leash Capacity} = \textbf{Cap + Command} (minimum 3).  
  Add +1 if \textbf{Spirit}~$>$~3 (resilient will) or \textbf{Presence}~$>$~3 (charismatic dominance).  
  Draw a clock or track with that many segments.
  \item \textbf{Tick Leash} whenever any of the following occur:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The spirit takes harm or suffers elemental backlash.
      \item You command it against its nature or Patron ethos.
      \item You \emph{split focus} (take another significant action while it acts on your order).
      \item A rival spirit contests control or influence.
      \item It rushes from \textit{Close} to \textit{Far} under duress.  
            Crossing a \texttt{[WARD]} invokes Outsider rules (\textit{DV = Cap}).
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Release:} When the Leash fills, the spirit acts according to its nature once, then departs or turns hostile at the GM’s discretion.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Economy \& Limits.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Boon Finesse:} Once per round, you may spend \textbf{1 Boon} to clear \textbf{1 Leash tick} on your current spirit (not after the Leash has filled).
  \item \textbf{Action Economy:} Issuing a meaningful command uses your action.
  \item \textbf{Concurrency:} You may maintain a number of active spirits whose combined \textbf{Cap} does not exceed your \textbf{Spirit} attribute.  
        Exceeding this limit immediately inflicts 1~Fatigue per excess Cap point.
  \item \textbf{Downtime:} All summons end at downtime unless a Talent, Rite, or Asset states otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Optional Variant.}
For mystical or ascetic summoners, replace the Leash formula with:
\[
\textbf{Leash Capacity} = \textit{Cap} + \textit{Spirit}
\]
Use this variant when summoning reflects inner resolve rather than tactical precision.
