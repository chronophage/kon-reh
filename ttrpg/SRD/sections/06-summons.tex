\section{Summons and Outsiders}

\subsection{Definition}
An \textbf{Outsider} is any being not native to the world of Fate’s Edge. This includes summoned spirits, demons, celestials, and entities that arrive from beyond the veil of the Eight Elements. They are powerful but dangerous to bind.

\subsection{Summoning (Pact-Whisperer Core)}
Summoning is a way to call and bind Outsiders for temporary aid.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Call} (1 Action): A spirit manifests at Near range. Choose a Spirit Template.
  \item \textbf{Bind}: Choose one: spend 1 Boon or mark 1 Fatigue.
  \item \textbf{Leash}: Set Leash = Cap + 2 segments (Cap is the Outsider’s tier, typically 1/3/5 for Lesser/Greater/Elder).
  \item \textbf{Tick Leash} whenever any occur:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Spirit takes harm.
      \item You command against its nature.
      \item You split focus (take another significant action while it acts).
      \item A rival contests it.
      \item It moves from Close to Far quickly.
      \item It crosses a [WARD].
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Departure}: When the Leash fills, the spirit acts to its nature once, then departs.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Limits:} Only one active summoned spirit at a time (unless a Talent says otherwise). All summons depart at Downtime unless explicitly sustained.

\subsection{Boon Finesse}
Once per round, you may spend 1 Boon to clear 1 tick from your current spirit’s Leash. You cannot do this after the Leash has filled.

\subsection{Outsider Caps}
\begin{itemize}
  \item PC-summoned Outsiders: Cap is limited by Talents (Lesser = 1, Greater = 3).
  \item NPC Outsiders: GM assigns based on story needs (Lesser = 1, Greater = 3, Elder = 5).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tags for Summons \& Outsiders}
Certain Tags specifically interact with Outsiders.

\begin{description}[leftmargin=1.5em, style=nextline]
  \item[WARD:] Creates a magical edge/zone that Outsiders must test to cross.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item DV = Outsider’s Cap.
      \item Hit: Outsider crosses and its Leash gains +DV segments.
      \item Partial: Outsider crosses and its Leash gains +1 segment.
      \item Miss: Outsider fails to cross this beat.
    \end{itemize}
  \item[BANISH:] Drives a visible Outsider toward departure.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item DV = Outsider’s Cap.
      \item Hit: Add +DV segments to its Leash (or Exit Tally).
      \item Partial: Add +1 segment.
      \item Miss: No effect.
    \end{itemize}
  \item[UNWARD:] Suppresses or dismisses a [WARD].
    \begin{itemize}
      \item DV by fiction (materials, sanctity, prep, locus, opposition).
      \item Hit: Ward dismissed/suppressed.
      \item Partial: Ward suppressed briefly (1 beat).
      \item Miss: No effect.
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsection{Unified Leash / Exit Tally System}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Summoned Outsiders track their service via a \textbf{Leash} (Cap + 2 segments).
  \item Non-summoned Outsiders affected by [WARD] or [BANISH] gain a temporary \textbf{Exit Tally} = Cap + 2. When the tally fills, they act to nature once, then depart.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GM Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Summons are not permanent allies; they are volatile forces.
  \item Always color Outsider behavior by their Elemental resonance and domain.
  \item When the Leash fills, deliver a memorable “act to nature” moment before they vanish.
  \item Use SB to escalate Outsider complications: a jealous Patron, a backlash of strange omens, or collateral spiritual harm.
\end{itemize}
