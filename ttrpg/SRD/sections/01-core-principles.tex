\section{Core Principles}

\subsection{Identity of Fate's Edge}
Fate's Edge is a narrative-first tabletop roleplaying system where every action carries weight, every choice has consequence, and every spell risks backlash. Dice are not simply a measure of success or failure---they are instruments of fate, weaving opportunity with risk.

\subsection{A World of Consequences}

\subsubsection{Design Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Narrative Primacy:} Mechanics exist to serve the story.
  \item \textbf{Risk as Drama:} Every roll carries the potential for triumph and complication.
  \item \textbf{Meaningful Growth:} Advancement is more than improving statistics.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Central Question}
\emph{What are you willing to risk, and what are you willing to pay, to reshape the world around you?}

\subsubsection{Tone of Play}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cinematic, with pacing tied to narrative beats.
  \item Consequential, where even small choices ripple outward.
  \item Collaborative, empowering both GM and players.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Concepts}

\subsubsection{Narrative Time}
Time is measured by story weight:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{A Moment} --- A heartbeat, a glance, a single strike or word.
  \item \textbf{Some Time} --- A few minutes, enough for a skirmish.
  \item \textbf{Significant Time} --- Hours, long enough for travel or rituals.
  \item \textbf{Days} --- Large-scale endeavors: marches, training, recovery.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Story Beats}
Whenever a player rolls dice, each result of 1 generates a Story Beat (SB). These are narrative fuel. The GM spends them to introduce twists.

\subsubsection{Affinity}
Each culture provides an Affinity: a narrative edge or metaphysical bond. Affinities make certain Arts, skills, or actions more reliable.

\subsubsection{Prestige Abilities}
High-level talents unlocked by mastering cultural arts or philosophies. They are narrative milestones as much as mechanical ones.

\subsubsection{On-Screen vs.\ Off-Screen}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{On-Screen Resources:} Companions, hirelings, or allies who stand beside you in danger.
  \item \textbf{Off-Screen Resources:} Taverns, estates, titles, or networks of informants.
\end{itemize}
