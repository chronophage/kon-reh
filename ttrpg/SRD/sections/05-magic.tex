\section{The Magic System}

Magic in Fate's Edge is expressed through three interconnected paths. 
You may specialize in one, or mix them at greater bookkeeping cost. 
All paths share the same dice engine and SB/Obligation economies, but their flavor and risks differ.

\subsection{Three Faces of Magic}
\begin{description}[leftmargin=1.5em, style=nextline]
  \item[Caster (Freeform):] Requires \textbf{Talent: Caster’s Gift (2 XP)}. Grants access to Weave \& Cast using the Eight Elements. Flexible, creative, and risky (Backlash on 1s). 
  \item[Rites User (Warlock):] Requires \textbf{Patron + Thiasos (Familiar) + Codex (4 XP)}. Grants access to a Patron’s Rites. Structured, powerful, but debt-driven through \textbf{Obligation}.
  \item[Invoker (Symbol Path):] Requires one or more \textbf{Patron’s Symbols (4 XP each)}. Grants access to that Patron’s Rites via rituals. Safe but slow; can \emph{Crack the Seal} to cast instantly at steep Obligation cost.
\end{description}

\subsection{Casting (Freeform)}
\paragraph{Weave \& Cast}
Casters describe the effect in terms of the Eight Elements (Earth, Fire, Air, Water, Fate, Life, Luck, Death). The GM sets DV and Effect based on scope. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Weave:} Player builds dice pool and rolls. On success, they stabilize the spell’s form.
  \item \textbf{Cast:} A second roll channels the effect into the world. 
  \item \textbf{Backlash:} Any 1 rolled may cause narrative backlash related to the Element.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Limits}
Casters can attempt any effect that can be described, but the larger the scope, the higher the DV. Improvisation is costly; reliable effects require repeated use and narrative justification.

\subsection{Rites Users (Warlocks)}
\paragraph{Requirements}
A Patron bond, a Thiasos (Familiar), and a Codex (4 XP) mark a character as a Warlock. 

\paragraph{Invocation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Action Cost:} Invoking a Rite requires 1 Action. 
  \item \textbf{Obligation:} Each Rite used marks Obligation on its clock. 
  \item \textbf{Push It:} Once per Rite, you may Push to increase its duration or potency by +1 step at the cost of +1 Obligation.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Obligation Clock}
Tracks the Patron’s claim. When full, the GM resolves the debt in-fiction. Obligation is reduced through service or downtime actions.

\subsection{Invokers (Symbol Path)}
\paragraph{Patron’s Symbol}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Minor Asset, 4 XP each.}
  \item Each Symbol is consecrated to one Patron and grants ritual access to that Patron’s Rites. 
  \item You may hold multiple Symbols, one per Patron.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Ritual Invocation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Time:} Requires Significant Time (typically 10–30 minutes). 
  \item \textbf{Obligation:} Completing a ritual always marks +1 Obligation. 
  \item \textbf{No Push:} Invoker Rites cannot use Push It benefits. 
  \item \textbf{Symbol Display:} The Symbol must be visible throughout the ritual.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Crack the Seal (Instant Cast)}
As part of an Invoker Rite, you may immediately resolve the effect by setting the Symbol to \emph{Compromised} and marking +2 Obligation segments (+3 if High-Power). The GM may spend 1 SB on-theme. The Symbol remains but must be restored in downtime.

\paragraph{Restoring Symbols}
A Compromised Symbol is inert until repaired. Use a downtime action and test (DV 3 or fiction-appropriate). Success restores it; a shaky result leaves it Neglected (rituals work but cost +1 Obligation).

\paragraph{Invoker Path Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cannot Push. 
  \item Environment must be suitable (ritual space, purity, etc.).
  \item Max simultaneous rituals = Spirit. Starting a new ritual ends the oldest or adds +1 Obligation to it. 
  \item Carrying 4+ Symbols causes interference: the first ritual each scene marks +1 extra Obligation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Patron’s Gift (Imbuements)}
\textbf{Patron’s Gift (Free, Requires Thiasos)}\\
Duration: Scene; Range: Touch; Stacking: No.\\
Effect: Imbue one item with +1 Weapon (Melee) and +1 Thematic Skill (Patron domain) for the scene.\\
Activation: Requires 1 Action once per scene.\\
Push It: The item’s power persists for one additional scene but marks +1 Obligation.\\
Requires: Familiar (Invoke: 1 Boon).

\subsection{Mixing the Paths}
Players may combine Casting, Rites, and Invoking, but each path introduces its own bookkeeping:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Casters track Backlash. 
  \item Rites users track Obligation. 
  \item Invokers track Symbol states (Maintained, Neglected, Compromised). 
\end{itemize}
Mixing provides flexibility but less efficiency than specialization. Specialists gain stronger benefits, while mixers gain narrative breadth.
