\section{Combat Positioning, Range Bands, Harm, and Tactical Clocks}

\subsection{Range Bands}
Keep distance simple. Use bands to answer: can you reach them, affect them, or see them right now?
\begin{description}[leftmargin=1.5em, style=nextline]
  \item[Close] Arm’s length, grapples, knives. You can touch, shove, or clinch.
  \item[Near] Same room/street segment/skirmish space; a quick step or two away.
  \item[Far] Same site/area but not in immediate reach; you need time, route, or a long implement.
  \item[Absent] Off-screen / away; outside the current scene frame (requires a cut or travel to interact).
\end{description}
For brevity’s sake, assume \textbf{Near} unless otherwise specified.

\paragraph{Melee Flag}
At any moment, the GM may mark two parties in \textbf{Melee} if they are in Near and directly engaged. This is a flag, not a separate band.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Enter:} 1 Move to engage from Near (Risky if under fire).
  \item \textbf{Leave:} 1 Move to break off; if threatened, test to \emph{Disengage} at Risky. On Partial/Miss, suffer a soft consequence and remain in Melee.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Movement (beats, not meters)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 Move shifts one band: Close$\leftrightarrow$Near or Near$\leftrightarrow$Far.
  \item \emph{Dash} (your action) shifts two bands: Close$\rightarrow$Far or Far$\rightarrow$Close in one go.
  \item Terrain/obstacles may add +1 Move (crowds, rubble, locks) or demand a test first.
  \item Break contact: Leaving Close cleanly can be a Disengage test; on success you step to Near without a complication.
  \item Absent$\leftrightarrow$Far/Near: use a Travel clock [2--4] or a quick cut; under pressure, treat as Risky.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Targeting \& Tools}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Melee/Touch:} Close only (or Near on long polearms at Limited Effect).
  \item \textbf{Thrown/Short magic:} Near; at Far expect Limited Effect or +1 DV unless the source says otherwise.
  \item \textbf{Firearms/Long bows/Line spells:} Near and Far if stated; at off-band, decrease Effect or increase DV by +1.
  \item \textbf{Social:} Near by default; at Far you need voice, signal, or proxy; at Absent you need message, oath, or setup.
  \item \textbf{No line of sight:} either raise DV by +1, drop Effect a step, or require [REVEAL]/[MARK] to proceed.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Perception, Stealth, Cover}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Notice:} Near is normal. Far is harder—raise DV by +1 or impose Limited Effect, especially in noise/cover.
  \item \textbf{Hide:} Break line of sight or move to Far; at Absent you’re off the current frame unless someone tracks you.
  \item \textbf{Cover:} Improves Position or reduces consequence severity; quality/angle sets the bump.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Position Dynamics (Hybrid)}
\paragraph{Position (Controlled / Risky / Desperate)}
Position sets consequence severity on a Partial/Miss; it does not change DV.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{GM Spend (1 CP):} Shift Position one step worse for the current action or apply a brief environmental shove (smoke, crowd surge, slippery ledge) that justifies the shift.
  \item \textbf{Player Spend (1 Boon):} Shift Position one step better for your current action or cancel a single 1-step GM shift just declared.
  \item \textbf{Narrative Triggers (free):} Flanking, reinforcements, collapsing cover, superior leverage, or proof can move Position one step (GM call). Say why.
\end{itemize}
Limits: One Boon shift per action. Multiple forces can’t stack beyond one step each way—resolve in order declared.

\subsection{Combat-Specific Consequence Types}
Use suits as a shorthand for consequence domains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Hearts:} Morale, fear, command/control breakdown.
  \item \textbf{Spades:} Physical harm, positioning changes, weapon status.
  \item \textbf{Clubs:} Resource depletion, gear damage, fatigue.
  \item \textbf{Diamonds:} Environmental hazards, reinforcements, magical/spiritual backlash.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Harm Integration}
Harm tracks tie into the CP economy:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Minor ($-$):} Generate 1 CP on your next \textbf{two} rolls.
  \item \textbf{Moderate ($=$):} Generate 1 CP on your next roll; $-1$ die to relevant actions.
  \item \textbf{Severe ($\ddagger$):} Generate 2 CP on your next roll; $-2$ dice to relevant actions.
  \item \textbf{Critical ($\dagger$):} Generate 3 CP on your next roll; you are out of action until treated.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tactical Clocks}
Track persistent combat conditions with clocks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mob Overwhelm [6]:} Enemy numbers become advantage.
  \item \textbf{Fatigue Spiral [4]:} Exhaustion affects performance.
  \item \textbf{Morale Collapse [6]:} Fear undermines effectiveness.
  \item \textbf{Environmental Collapse [8]:} Terrain/fire/building failure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Magic in Combat (Quick Integration)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Casting:} Requires \emph{Caster’s Gift (2 XP)}. Channel and Weave are each 1 Player Turn; in a hurry, treat as Risky with tighter consequences.
  \item \textbf{Rites:} 1 Action to Invoke; may \emph{Push It} for +1 Obligation to extend potency or duration.
  \item \textbf{Invokers:} Rituals take Significant Time; \emph{Crack the Seal} converts to a 1-Action instant cast, sets Symbol to Compromised, and marks +2/+3 Obligation (GM may spend 1 CP on-theme).
  \item \textbf{Imbuements (Patron’s Gift):} Requires 1 Action once/scene to activate; grants +1 Weapon (Melee) and +1 thematic Skill for the remainder of the scene. \emph{Push It} adds one scene and +1 Obligation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GM Quick Cues}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Start at \textbf{Risky/Standard} in \textbf{Near}. Shift Position for rushes or retreats; shift Effect for reach/quality.
  \item If distance is fuzzy, ask: ``Do you need a beat to get there?'' If yes, spend a Move; if no, you’re Near.
  \item Call \textbf{Melee} when knives are actually in play—don’t track hexes.
  \item Prefer one memorable complication over many petty penalties.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Worked Micro-Examples}
\paragraph{Rush the Marksman}
\emph{You sprint from Far to Close in one go (Dash).} GM calls it Risky. You roll and get a Hit with 1 CP. You reach Melee; GM spends 1 CP to twist your footing (Position drops a step for your next action).

\paragraph{Veil and Strike}
\emph{You activate Patron’s Gift (Action) and then attack.} Your Imbued weapon grants +1 and your thematic Skill applies. You hit, but roll a 1: GM banks CP and later spends it to have a ward flare that exposes your silhouette.

\paragraph{Crack the Seal Under Fire}
\emph{You present the Symbol and Crack the Seal to drop a [WARD] ring.} Instant cast: Symbol $\rightarrow$ Compromised; mark +2 Obligation. You hit; an Outsider tries to cross and adds +DV to its Leash on a Hit per [WARD] rules.
