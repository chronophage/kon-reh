\section{Rites, Invokers, and Symbols}
\label{sec:rites}

Magic in \textbf{Fate's Edge} expresses through three intertwined practices: \textbf{Rites} (oathbound authority), \textbf{Invocations} (symbolic ritual), and \textbf{Patron Pacts} (gifts and obligations). The rules below emphasize fiction-first play: consequences are Story Beats (SB) that prompt twists; numbers follow the story.

\subsection{Rites and Patrons (Runekeepers)}
\label{subsec:runekeepers}
Characters who bind themselves to a \emph{single} Patron and study that Patron's \textbf{Codex} are \textbf{Runekeepers}. Their magic is structured, immediate, and tied to service.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{One-Patron Rule.} A Runekeeper may be bound to \emph{only one} Patron at a time. This sharpens identity and keeps Obligation on a single ledger.
  \item \textbf{Thiasos (Familiar).} A circle, retinue, or emissary that grounds the pact in fiction. Required to access \emph{Patron's Gift}.
  \item \textbf{Codex.} The Patron's corpus of rites and precedents. Grants access to the Patron's Rites.
  \item \textbf{Invoke Rites.} A Runekeeper may Invoke a known Rite from their Patron as a \textbf{1 action} effect. On completion, mark \textbf{+1 Obligation} to that Patron. You may \emph{Push It} once per scene to amplify the effect, marking \textbf{+1 additional Obligation}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Invokers and Symbols}
\label{subsec:invokers}
Invokers relate to Patrons through consecrated \textbf{Symbols}: physical tokens that anchor names and permissions.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Symbols (Minor Asset).} Each Symbol is keyed to one Patron; cost \textbf{4 XP}. You may own Symbols of different Patrons (one Symbol per Patron).
  \item \textbf{Ritual Invocation.} Display the Symbol and perform the Rite as a \emph{ritual} (Significant Time). Completion always marks \textbf{+1 Obligation} on that Rite's ledger.
  \item \textbf{Crack the Seal.} As part of an Invoker Rite, you may resolve the effect instantly by setting the Symbol to \emph{Compromised} and marking \textbf{+2 Obligation} (\textbf{+3} if High-Power). The Keeper may spend 1 on-theme SB immediately. The asset remains but is inert until restored.
  \item \textbf{Restore a Symbol.} 1 downtime action and a fitting test (DV 3 or by fiction). Success: \emph{Maintained}; shaky: returns \emph{Neglected}. Or spend \textbf{1 XP} to fully restore.
  \item \textbf{Display Requirement.} Symbols must be openly displayed for rituals. Hidden Symbols do not function.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Casting and Free-Form Magic}
\label{subsec:casting}
Improvised casting is possible with the \textbf{Caster's Gift} Talent (\textbf{2 XP}). It is a \emph{backup toolkit}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Small, local effects (typ. DV 2--3), fiction-first, colored by Elements and locus.
  \item Heavy control effects such as \texttt{[WARD]}, \texttt{[BANISH]}, or \texttt{[UNWARD]} require a printed Talent, Rite, or Spell result.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Patron's Gift (Imbuements)}
\label{subsec:patrons-gift}
The pact may mark a devotee's tools with a short-lived boon aligned to the Patron's domain.

\paragraph{Requirements.}
\textbf{Thiasos (Familiar)} is required. Invoking the Gift costs \textbf{1 Boon}. A Codex is \emph{not} required for the Gift.

\paragraph{Activation and Duration.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Action:} 1 action to activate; \textbf{1/scene}.
  \item \textbf{Duration:} Scene. \emph{Push It:} extend for one additional scene by marking \textbf{+1 Obligation} to that Patron (max one Push per scene).
  \item \textbf{Range:} Touch (you must handle the item).
  \item \textbf{Stacking:} Gifts from the \emph{same Patron} do not stack; take the best active version. Dice bonuses respect the table's \textbf{+3 dice cap}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Effect.}
Choose one held item you or an ally carries. Until scene end it grants:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{+1 Melee} (the item counts as a magical weapon), and
  \item \textbf{+1 Thematic} (a \emph{+1 die} to a fixed Skill tied to your Patron; see Table~\ref{tab:gift-thematic-map}). Apply only when the fiction clearly fits the Patron's sphere and how the item is used.
\end{itemize}

% SRD Insert: Clearing Obligation Segments (Condensed SRD Version)

\section{Clearing Obligation Segments (Condensed)}\label{sec:obligation-clearing-srd}
\index{Obligation}\index{Patrons}\index{Acts of Service}\index{Boon}\index{Focused Devotion}

Obligation tracks the narrative weight of a Patron’s attention. To reduce it, characters must act in ways that reaffirm their relevance.

\subsection*{Off-Screen Clearing (Primary)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Act of Service.} Clear 1 segment by performing a thematically resonant act of service to the Patron.
\item \textbf{Requirement.} The player provides an \emph{Intricate Description} of the act.\index{Acts of Service}
\item \textbf{Scope.} Not arduous, but meaningful and aligned to the Patron’s sphere.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{On-Screen Clearing (Optional)}
\paragraph{Talent: Focused Devotion (3–5 XP).}\index{Focused Devotion}
Once per scene, spend 1 Boon to clear 1 segment of Obligation for a Patron. Cannot be used on segments accrued in the same scene.

\subsection*{Narrative Implications}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Agency.} Players choose how service manifests.
\item \textbf{Collaboration.} GM approves sufficiency of the act.
\item \textbf{Dynamics.} Patron bonds remain active and evolving.
\item \textbf{Capping.} Prevents snowball clearing during a scene; off-screen remains the main method.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Runekeeper Clarification.}
A Runekeeper (one Patron + Codex) may Invoke Rites on-screen and use Patron's Gift if they also possess \textbf{Thiasos (Familiar)}. Codex alone does not grant the Gift. Symbols are optional for parley or omens and do not gate Runekeeper Invocation or the Gift.

\section*{Borrowed Grace}
\label{talent:borrowed-grace}
\index{Talents!Invoker}\index{Imbuement!Lesser}

\textbf{Type:} Invoker Talent — \textit{Lesser Imbuement}

\subsection*{Use}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cost:} 1 Boon, 1 action.
  \item \textbf{Effect (pick one on use):} \textbf{+1 Melee} \emph{or} \textbf{+1 Thematic} (your table’s thematic Skill).
  \item \textbf{Duration:} \textit{Single action/attack} (instantaneous boost).
  \item \textbf{Requirement:} Wield/display the Patron’s \textbf{Symbol}.
  \item \textbf{Obligation:} +1 \textbf{Obligation} to that Patron immediately (see \S\ref{sec:obligation}).
  \item \textbf{Limits:} Cannot be extended, stacked, or \emph{Pushed} for duration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Fictional Framing}
A quick, rule-bending channel through a Patron’s \emph{Symbol}—a sliver of grace, borrowed for a moment and paid for in debt.

\subsection*{Table Guidance (1-liners)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Combat:} Spike a strike vs. a tough foe; or steady a parry in a desperate bind.
  \item \textbf{Skill:} Nudge a pivotal social/ritual/track roll tied to the Patron’s sphere.
  \item \textbf{Fallout:} Repeated use accrues \textbf{Obligation}; NPC faithful may notice “stolen” grace.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Balance Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Weaker than full Imbuement: \emph{one} action, no sustain, upfront Obligation.
  \item \textbf{Symbol dependency:} No Symbol, no channel (concealed or lost Symbol = no effect).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{GM Hooks (quick picks)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Compel Debt:} A Patron agent arrives when Obligation crosses a tick.
  \item \textbf{Clash of Signs:} Using rival Symbols back-to-back risks minor \textbf{Backlash} (drop Position or +1 SB).
  \item \textbf{Spotlight Tell:} Brief visual tell (scent, sigil flare) marks the borrowing to observant NPCs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Specialization vs.\ Mixing}
\label{subsec:mixing}
Characters can mix paths (Summoner, Caster, Invoker, Runekeeper), but specialization is usually stronger and cleaner. Mixing increases upkeep (Obligation, Symbol state, Leash) and action congestion without guaranteed power gains. Let fiction guide choices: Story Beats are prompts to advance the scene, not punishments.

\section{Patron Rivalries}
\label{sec:patron-rivalries}

Rivalries set expectations for tone and friction. Use them to color rulings, nudge Position, and guide how Story Beats (SB) land. In their home domains, a Patron’s work tends to start a step better in Position; in a rival’s, a step worse (Keeper’s call).
