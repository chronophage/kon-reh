\label{sec:rites}

Magic in Fate's Edge is expressed in three intertwined practices: \textbf{Rites}, \textbf{Invocations}, and \textbf{Patron Pacts}. Each represents a different philosophy of engaging with the unseen world.

\subsection{Rites and Patrons}
Characters who enter into service with a Patron gain access to their Rites. This path emphasizes ritual, sacrifice, and relationship with a higher power.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Thiasos:} A circle of believers or cultists bound to the Patron. Provides narrative justification and a base of operations.
    \item \textbf{Codex:} A body of lore and ritual instructions, forming the basis of a Warlock’s magic.
    \item \textbf{Rites:} Formal rituals, often requiring time, components, or ceremonial actions. They can reshape scenes, summon allies, or curse enemies.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Invokers and Symbols}
Invokers pursue a looser relationship with Patrons, using a symbolic shorthand to access their power.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Symbols:} Each Symbol represents an aspect of a Patron’s domain. Purchasing a Symbol costs 4 XP. A character may hold multiple Symbols, each tied to a specific Patron.
    \item \textbf{Invocation:} With a Symbol, the Invoker can perform the Rites of that Patron as full rituals. By compromising the ritual (cutting corners, sacrificing safety), they may instead cast the Rite as an action.
    \item \textbf{Conflict:} Invokers who attempt to use a rival Patron’s Symbol risk backlash, narrative consequences, or permanent scarring of their connection to the unseen.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rites vs. Casting}
Casting in free-form requires the \textbf{Casting Talent}. Rites users without this talent cannot freely improvise magic, but instead channel through Codex instructions or Symbols. This ensures that Rites remain structured and distinct from open-ended spellcasting.

\subsection{Interaction with Imbuements}
Imbuements may be layered onto Rites or Invocations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item They require a 1/scene activation action.
    \item Provide either a +1 weapon bonus or a +1 thematic skill bonus, as chosen when gained.
    \item They do not automatically empower Rites, but a clever Keeper may allow imbuements to augment ritual focus, implements, or symbolic resonance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Specialization vs. Mixing}
A character may pursue multiple magical paths (Summoner, Caster, Invoker, Rite-user), but specialization is rewarded. Mixing paths increases bookkeeping and resource expenditure without necessarily providing greater power. Most players will find greater narrative and mechanical impact in deepening a single approach.
