## Playtest: Core Loop & Subsystems

Scenario: The Collapsing Archive (unstable, flooded stacks beneath a ruined temple)

Scene Clocks
	•	Travel [4] — descent/progress
	•	Environmental Collapse [6] — structure failing
	•	Lantern Integrity [4] — light failure

At the Table: Quick Assumptions
	•	Roll Attribute + Skill in d10s.
	•	Count successes: 6–9 = 1, 10 = 2.
	•	1s = Story Beats (SB) for the GM.
	•	Outcome: Clean Success / Success & Cost / Partial (>0 but <DV) / Miss (0).
	•	Position: Dominant (reroll 1 failure) / Controlled (no rerolls) / Desperate (must reroll 1 success).
	•	Boons: Partial = +1 Boon, Miss = +2 Boons.

⸻

### Test 1 — Core Resolution + Position & Effect + SB

Situation. Lyra (Wits 3, Lore 2) reads active ward-runes while the floor trembles (Environmental Collapse +1 → 1/6).
GM Call. This is methodical but under pressure: Controlled / Standard, DV 3.

Roll. 5d10 → {8, 6, 4, 2, 1}
	•	Successes: 8, 6 = 2. SB: 1 (the 1).
	•	Outcome: Partial (2 < DV 3) → +1 Boon to Lyra.

Resolution. She deciphers enough: “A Guardian of the Deep lies near,” but lacks fine detail.
SB Spend (1). The shaking worsens; Environmental Collapse +1 → 2/6.

⸻

### Test 2 — Position Pressure & Boons

Situation. Kael (Body 3, Athletics 2) must leap a widening chasm to a hanging rope.
GM Call. High stakes, bad footing: Desperate / Standard, DV 4.

Roll. 5d10 → {9, 7, 5, 3, 1}; Desperate forces a reroll of one success → reroll 9 → 4. Final kept dice: {7, 5, 4, 3, 1}
	•	Successes: 7, 5 = 2. SB: 1.
	•	Outcome: Partial (2 < 4) → +1 Boon to Kael.

Resolution. He catches the rope but lands hard and off-balance.
SB Spend (1). The jolt bites: Kael marks 1 Fatigue.

⸻

### Test 3 — Fatigue in Action

Situation. A damaged ward spits force; Kael (now 1 Fatigue) reacts. This is a quick defensive Skirmish at DV 3.
GM Call. Controlled / Limited, DV 3. Fatigue penalty applies (−1 die).

Roll. Body 3 + Skirmish 1 = 4d10 → -1 die for Fatigue → 3d10 → {6, 3, 1}
	•	Successes: 6 = 1. SB: 1.
	•	Outcome: Partial (1 < 3) → +1 Boon to Kael.

Resolution. He deflects most of it, still grazed.
SB Spend (1). Residual shock: Kael marks +1 Fatigue (now 2).

Note: Fatigue is beginning to drag Kael’s dice and push future actions toward Desperate choices.

⸻

### Test 4 — Deck of Consequences at a Stress Beat

Situation. Thane (Spirit 2, Insight 2) seeks the main vault path as the structure groans. The Environmental Collapse clock fills here (6/6).
GM Call. Controlled / Standard, DV 3.

Roll. 4d10 → {7, 5, 3, 1}
	•	Successes: 7, 5 = 2. SB: 1.
	•	Outcome: Partial (2 < 3) → +1 Boon to Thane.

Resolution. He feels the direction, but it’s uncertain.
SB Spend (1) and Clock Trigger (filled): Draw from the Deck of Consequences.
	•	Draw: 7 of Spades (Spades = physical hazard; 7 = contained complication).
	•	Effect: A stone column drops and blocks the promising path. The group must detour or clear debris.

⸻

### Test 5 — Magic (Caster: Freeform) — Weave then Cast

Situation. Seris (Wits 3, Arcana 2, Caster’s Gift) reinforces a failing wall to buy time.
GM Call (Weave). Scene-scale binding under stress: Controlled / Standard, DV 4.

Weave Roll. 5d10 → {10, 8, 4, 2, 1}
	•	Successes: 10 = 2, 8 = 1 → 3 total. SB: 1 (the 1).
	•	Outcome: Partial (3 < 4) → +1 Boon to Seris.

Weave Result. The lattice forms but flickers.
SB Spend (1). A pressure pulse rolls through the flooded stacks; everyone marks 1 Fatigue (Kael to 3).

GM Call (Cast). Complete the effect before it fails: Controlled / Standard, DV 4.

Cast Roll. 5d10 → {9, 6, 5, 3, 1}
	•	Successes: 9, 6 = 2. SB: 1.
	•	Outcome: Partial (2 < 4) → +1 Boon to Seris.

Cast Result. The brace holds for now, but it’s strained.
SB Spend (2) (banked 0 + current 1, plus 1 from earlier if you banked it; or spend both current/available):
	•	Seris marks 2 Fatigue (casting drain).
	•	Slate-gray fracture lines riddle the brace. It will fail explosively if stressed again; treat as a looming hazard clock or advance Environmental if you’re still tracking collapse separately.

⸻

### Takeaways (What We Proved at the Table)
	•	Core Loop: Declare → set DV & Position → roll → apply Outcome → spend SB / award Boons. Clean, fast, and produces fiction-rich results.
	•	Position Matters: Dominant saves you from whiffs (reroll a failure). Desperate adds drama (reroll a success you needed). Most exploration actions here were Controlled, with Desperate reserved for the big leap.
	•	SB Are Fuel, Not Punishment: The GM’s SB translated directly into evolving danger (clock ticks, falling columns, fatigue shocks) without stealing successes.
	•	Boons Encourage Risk: Partials fed players Boons that they later used to assist, set up, or bump Position. Players leaned into hard moves knowing failure wasn’t empty.
	•	Fatigue Bites Early: Even at 1–2 Fatigue, the penalty was felt. It nudged choices, created tension, and forecast Harm if they kept pushing.
	•	Deck Keeps Surprises On-Theme: The Spades draw turned pressure into a concrete obstacle, aligning with fiction while avoiding arbitrary “gotchas.”
	•	Freeform Magic Is Potent but Pricey: Weave/ Cast split let Seris attempt scene-scale change, but Partial results stacked Fatigue and future risk. Power with teeth.

⸻

### Optional Tweaks You Can Try Next Session
	•	Let a player spend 1 Boon to shift Position one step (once per action), mirroring GM’s ability to worsen it with SB.
	•	Put thresholds on Fatigue (e.g., at 2/4/6 Fatigue apply −1/−2/−3 dice), if you want clearer breakpoints.
	•	Tie explosive brace failure to a small hazard clock [3] so players can see the fuse burning.

⸻

### At‑a‑Glance Rules
	•	Dice Pool: Attribute + Skill (d10s). Successes: 6–9 = 1, 10 = 2.
	•	Story Beats (SB): Each 1 rolled gives the GM 1 SB. GM may spend SB for consequences or draws.
	•	Outcome Steps: Clean Success / Success & Cost / Partial (>0 but < DV, +1 Boon) / Miss (0, +2 Boons).
	•	Position: Dominant (reroll 1 failure) • Controlled (no rerolls) • Desperate (reroll 1 success).
	•	Effect: Limited / Standard / Great — sets scope of what the success achieves.
	•	Boons: Player currency from setbacks; spend to assist, prepare, or improve Position one step (table option).

⸻

### Scene Setup (Clocks)
	•	Travel [4] — descent/progress.
	•	Environmental Collapse [6] — structure failing.
	•	Lantern Integrity [4] — light failure.

GM SB Bank (running): Track SB gained (from 1s) and SB spent for consequences.

## Side‑by‑Side: Fiction vs. Roll & Outcome

### Test 1 — Read the Active Runes (Core Loop, SB)

Fiction	Roll & Outcome
Lyra (Wits 3, Lore 2) studies ward‑runes as the floor trembles (Environmental +1 → 1/6).	Position: Controlled / Standard. DV 3. Roll 5d10 → {8, 6, 4, 2, 1} → 2 successes (8, 6), 1 SB. Outcome: Partial (+1 Boon to Lyra). SB Spend (1): Collapse worsens → Environmental +1 → 2/6.

### Test 2 — The Chasm Leap (Position Pressure, Boons)

Fiction	Roll & Outcome
Kael (Body 3, Athletics 2) jumps for a swinging rope above a widening gap.	Position: Desperate / Standard. DV 4. Roll 5d10 → {9, 7, 5, 3, 1} → Desperate rerolls one success: reroll 9 → 4. Kept: {7, 5, 4, 3, 1}. 2 successes, 1 SB. Outcome: Partial (+1 Boon to Kael). SB Spend (1): The landing hurts → Kael marks 1 Fatigue.

### Test 3 — Ward Backlash (Fatigue in Play)

Fiction	Roll & Outcome
A cracked ward spits force; Kael (now 1 Fatigue) reacts defensively.	Position: Controlled / Limited. DV 3. Dice penalty for Fatigue –1 die. Roll 3d10 → {6, 3, 1} → 1 success, 1 SB. Outcome: Partial (+1 Boon to Kael). SB Spend (1): Residual shock → Kael marks +1 Fatigue (now 2).

### Test 4 — Find the Vault Path (Deck Draw Trigger)

Fiction	Roll & Outcome
Thane (Spirit 2, Insight 2) seeks the main vault route as the structure groans. Environmental Collapse fills → 6/6.	Position: Controlled / Standard. DV 3. Roll 4d10 → {7, 5, 3, 1} → 2 successes, 1 SB. Outcome: Partial (+1 Boon to Thane). SB Spend (1) and Clock Trigger: Draw 7♠ (physical hazard, contained). A stone column falls and blocks the promising path; detour or clear debris.

### Test 5 — Weave & Cast (Freeform Magic under Stress)

Fiction	Roll & Outcome
Seris (Wits 3, Arcana 2, Caster’s Gift) reinforces a failing wall to buy time.	Weave: Controlled / Standard, DV 4. Roll 5d10 → {10, 8, 4, 2, 1} → 3 successes (10=2, 8=1), 1 SB. Outcome: Partial (+1 Boon to Seris). SB Spend (1): Pressure pulse; everyone marks 1 Fatigue (Kael to 3).
	Cast: Controlled / Standard, DV 4. Roll 5d10 → {9, 6, 5, 3, 1} → 2 successes, 1 SB. Outcome: Partial (+1 Boon to Seris). SB Spend (1): Seris marks 1 Fatigue and the brace gains a visible fracture hazard [3] that may fail if stressed.

### What This Demonstrates
	•	Core Loop works fast: Declare → set DV & Position → roll → apply Outcome → spend SB / award Boons.
	•	Position matters: Dominant saves you, Desperate risks the success you needed.
	•	SB drive play: Consequences escalate clocks, hazards, and costs without erasing progress.
	•	Boons reward risk: Players gain tools from setbacks and can push back on Position next action.
	•	Fatigue has teeth: Early penalties change choices and foreshadow Harm.
	•	Deck adds surprise: Suit‑themed twists keep pressure fresh and on‑tone.
	•	Magic is potent but costly: Scene‑scale effects invite Partial results, Fatigue, and hazards.

⸻

### Quick Reference (margin)
	•	Success math: 6–9 = 1 hit; 10 = 2 hits; 1s → GM SB.
	•	Outcomes: Clean / Cost / Partial (+1 Boon) / Miss (+2 Boons).
	•	Position: Dominant (reroll 1 failure) • Controlled • Desperate (reroll 1 success).
	•	Common SB spends: hazard appears; clock +1; position worsens; fatigue spike.
	•	Common Boon spends: assist +1d; prepare advantage; improve Position 1 step.
