\chapter{Advanced GM Techniques}

As the campaign deepens and the stakes rise, the GM must evolve from storyteller to \textbf{architect of tension}. This chapter explores advanced techniques for managing complex scenes, faction interplay, and custom content creation. These tools will help you keep the world dynamic, the choices meaningful, and the consequences \textbf{echoing}.

\section*{Using the Deck of Consequences}

The \textbf{Deck of Consequences} is more than a randomizer—it is a \textbf{thematic engine} that externalizes risk and ensures that setbacks feel consistent and fair.

\subsection*{When to Draw}

After a roll generates Complication Points, the GM may choose to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spend CP directly} for tailored consequences.
    \item \textbf{Draw from the Deck} for a thematically fitting twist.
\end{itemize}

Never do both for the same roll. If a drawn card contradicts established fiction, reinterpret or redraw to fit the suit and tone.

\subsection*{Suit Meanings}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hearts (♠)}: Emotional, social, or relational fallout.
    \item \textbf{Diamonds (♢)}: Resource strain, economic or material cost.
    \item \textbf{Clubs (♣)}: Physical harm, environmental danger, or escalation.
    \item \textbf{Spades (♠)}: Mystical, narrative, or positional twists.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Rank Severity}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2–5}: Minor inconvenience or flavor complication.
    \item \textbf{6–9}: Moderate setback with some narrative teeth.
    \item \textbf{10–King}: Severe twist; alters stakes of the scene.
    \item \textbf{Ace}: Catastrophic turn; reshapes narrative or mission goal.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example}: A failed lockpick generates 2 CP. The GM draws: \textbf{Clubs 7} — “A guard rounds the corner just as the lock clicks.” The PCs are not caught—but they are seen. The alarm clock begins to tick.

\section*{Travel and Exploration}

Travel in Fate’s Edge is not a downtime skip—it is a \textbf{narrative layer} filled with tension, discovery, and risk. Use the card-based travel system to seed each leg with place, people, pressure, and leverage.

\subsection*{Drawing Route Legs}

For each travel leg, draw:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spade}: Sets the scene (place).
    \item \textbf{Heart}: Introduces the local actor or faction.
    \item \textbf{Club}: Brings pressure (from Wilds or destination deck).
    \item \textbf{Diamond}: Codified outcome (papers, escorts, rights).
\end{itemize}

Set a travel clock by the highest rank:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2–5} → 4 segments
    \item \textbf{6–10} → 6 segments
    \item \textbf{J/Q/K} → 8 segments
    \item \textbf{Ace} → 10 segments
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example}: Traveling the \textbf{Aelerian Passes}, the PCs draw: Spade (Avalanche gallery), Heart (Geometer), Club (Engineer requisition), Diamond (Underway Pass). Clock: 8. On failure, the GM spends CP to trigger a rockslide—Hazard +2.

\section*{Faction Dynamics}

Factions are \textbf{living entities} with goals, rivals, and shifting loyalties. They are not static backdrops—they are \textbf{players in the story}.

\subsection*{Creating Factions}

Each faction should have:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Core Motive}: What do they want?
    \item \textbf{Key Figures}: Who leads or represents them?
    \item \textbf{Resources}: What can they bring to bear?
    \item \textbf{Weaknesses}: What makes them vulnerable?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Faction Clocks}

Track factional pressure with clocks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rising Influence} (6): Gaining power, allies, or territory.
    \item \textbf{Internal Strife} (6): Leadership challenged, morale low.
    \item \textbf{Public Scandal} (4): Reputation damaged, support wanes.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example}: The \textbf{Viterra Dawn Knights} gain Rising Influence as they rally to the new Queen—but suffer Internal Strife as old commanders resist her reforms.

\section*{Creating Custom Content}

Fate’s Edge thrives on \textbf{player agency} and \textbf{world customization}. When designing new Talents, Assets, or Prestige Abilities, follow these principles:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Narrative First}: Does it reinforce a theme or culture?
    \item \textbf{Mechanical Balance}: Does it fit within the XP economy?
    \item \textbf{Fictional Integration}: Can it be explained in-world?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Designing Talents}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Early (3–5 XP)}: Once/scene ability, +1 die, or minor narrative edge.
    \item \textbf{Mid (6–10 XP)}: Once/session ability, significant edge, or codified outcome.
    \item \textbf{Prestige (12+ XP)}: Once/arc ability, scene-reshaping, or faction-level impact.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example}: \textbf{Backlash Soothing} (Wood Elf, 6 XP) — Once per session, reduce a magical Backlash by 2 points in natural terrain.

\subsection*{Designing Assets}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Minor (4 XP)}: Safehouse, Petty Title.
    \item \textbf{Standard (8 XP)}: Spy Ring, Charter.
    \item \textbf{Major (12 XP)}: Fortress Lease, Mercantile Network.
\end{itemize}

Each Asset should have:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Activation Cost}: 1 Boon or 2 XP.
    \item \textbf{Scope}: What can it plausibly do?
    \item \textbf{Fictional Hook}: Why does it exist in the world?
\end{itemize}

\section*{Running Complex Scenarios}

\subsection*{Heists and Infiltration}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Positioning}: Controlled entries, distractions, asset use.
    \item \textbf{Social Rails}: Curfew, Crowd, Sanctity.
    \item \textbf{Physical Rails}: Hazard, Hunt, Escape.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{GM Tip}: Let the PCs plan—but make the world react. A guard changes shift. A noble arrives early. The lock is newer than expected.

\subsection*{Battles and Skirmishes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Group Actions}: Use the Lead system to coordinate.
    \item \textbf{Follower Risk}: Helpers can be endangered on 2+ CP spends.
    \item \textbf{Clocks}: Hazard (terrain), Hunt (enemy approach), Escape (retreat).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Political Intrigue}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Leverage}: Diamonds and social rails determine influence.
    \item \textbf{Allies and Rivals}: Represented by Assets and Followers.
    \item \textbf{Public Image}: Tied to Mandate and Crisis clocks.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Narrative First: The World Reacts}

In Fate’s Edge, the world is not a puzzle to be solved—it is a \textbf{living system} that responds to player choices. Let factions shift. Let consequences ripple. And above all—let the story unfold.

Because in the end, it is not the GM who writes the legend.

It is the players.

You simply hold the quill.

\section{Using CP at High Tier}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Grades of Spend:} \emph{1--2 CP} = shove (local bite) • \emph{3--4 CP} = wrench (route/power rewire) • \emph{5+ CP} = rewrite (scene/arc shifts, new Fronts).
  \item \textbf{Banking Rule (optional):} At end of a leg, convert unspent CP to world motion at \textbf{3 CP $\to$ tick 1 Front}. At end of a session, you may cash \textbf{5 CP $\to$ spawn} a fresh 4–6 segment Front tied to what the table cared about.
  \item \textbf{Diamond/Exposure Interlock:} \emph{2 CP} can \/flip\/ any \SuitDiamond{} already spent (collect its Debt now), \emph{1 CP} can mark 1 \emph{Exposure} on a named Asset/Patron. \emph{4 CP} can suspend a visible Diamond until another is played.
  \item \textbf{Visibility:} Announce high-tier CP spends like weather. Players should understand the scale and inevitability even if they can still bargain.
\end{itemize}

\section{Personal/Character Sinks}
\subsection{Reputation Backlash Cascade}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,breakable,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={CP Menu}]
\textbf{3 CP:} Start a \emph{Reputation Debt} clock (6/8 segments) for a named region/faction.\\
\textbf{+2 CP:} Add cross-region contagion (adjacent port or court begins a 4-seg \emph{Echo}).\\
\textbf{5+ CP:} Fill remaining segments now; enact a policy shift, import ban, or bounty grade change (permanent until campaigned down).
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Mitigation:} Not by rolls. Requires \emph{public contrition}, \emph{reparations}, or \emph{structural change} scenes over downtime arcs. A \SuitDiamond{} can placate a gate for one beat, not erase the clock.

\subsection{Legacy Complications}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={CP Menu}]
\textbf{3 CP:} Degrade \emph{two} Assets or Holdings by 1 step each (Condition/Exposure).\\
\textbf{4 CP:} Create a 4–6 segment \emph{Maintenance Spiral} clock tying \emph{three} Assets together; each scene without attention ticks it.\\
\textbf{5+ CP:} Seize one Asset temporarily (trust breach, strike, garrison mutiny) until a concession or overhaul.
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Mitigation:} Hands-on visits, concessions, or replacing corrupt stewards; one concession can clear 2 segments.

\subsection{Ancestral/Cultural Debt}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={CP Menu}]
\textbf{2 CP:} Ancestral emissary appears; impose a taboo or task this scene.\\
\textbf{3--4 CP:} Start a 6–8 segment \emph{Ancestral Debt} Front; spirits or councils withdraw small courtesies (Position --).\\
\textbf{5+ CP:} Excommunication/shunning from key rites (no Host-right, no Craft-right) until a costly rite or concession.
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Mitigation:} Ritual, restitution, or binding \emph{Geasa}. \SuitDiamond{}s can buy audience, not absolution.

\section{World-State Sinks}
\subsection{Faction Stability Clocks}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={CP Menu}]
\textbf{3 CP:} Begin an \emph{Instability} clock for a polity (6/8).\\
\textbf{+1--2 CP/scene:} Protests, embargoes, or musters as ambient hazards.\\
\textbf{5+ CP:} Trigger outcome: coup, regency, civil war, or intervention (creates a new long Front).
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Mitigation:} Summit scenes; shared \SuitDiamond{} spends from multiple decks (truce, warrants) reduce by 2.

\subsection{Magical Resonance Buildup}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={CP Menu}]
\textbf{2 CP:} Residual hum—add DV +1 to \emph{arcane} actions in the zone this scene.\\
\textbf{3--4 CP:} Start a 6-seg \emph{Resonance} clock; on each tick, convert one \SuitClub{} to \emph{arcane misfire}.\\
\textbf{5+ CP:} Wild surge event—rewrite a route (Aeler under, Mistlands echo, Valewood omission) until sealed.
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Mitigation:} Seal a ley seam (ritual + sacrifice), or spend three thematically apt \SuitDiamond{}s (e.g., \emph{Ward-salt}, \emph{Way-cord}, \emph{Underway Pass}).

\subsection{Economic Disruption}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={CP Menu}]
\textbf{2 CP:} Tariffs spike; pay +1 coin/favor per cargo move this leg.\\
\textbf{3--4 CP:} Start \emph{Market Chaos} (6). Each tick increases cost of \SuitDiamond{} plays by +1 favor or narrows their scope.\\
\textbf{5+ CP:} Collapse a lane; must establish a new route or secure a charter to restore baseline costs.
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Mitigation:} Re-route via worked itineraries; win a charter (Thepyrgos/Harbourmaster/Kahfagia).

\section{Narrative Momentum Sinks}
\subsection{Inevitable Consequences}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={Rule}]
Label a complication \emph{Inevitable}. Its CP \textbf{must} be spent this act; you cannot bank it. If not spent by scene end, convert \textbf{3 CP $\to$ tick 1 Front} twice.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Prophecy Fulfillment}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={CP Menu}]
\textbf{Ace Echo:} Any \emph{A} shown advances a \emph{Fate} clock by +1.\\
\textbf{3 CP:} Manifest a portent (omen, witness, self-fulfilling guard).\\
\textbf{5+ CP:} Fulfil a verse—gain boon/doom; rewrite a bond or oath.
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Mitigation:} Change the terms (new oath, broken geas, sacrifice); costs a \emph{permanent} concession.

\subsection{Debt to Powers}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={CP Menu}]
\textbf{2 CP:} Demand: token sacrifice (memory, name, season of service).\\
\textbf{4 CP:} Escalation: impose a new taboo; violating it gives the GM +2 CP each time.\\
\textbf{6+ CP:} Collection: the Power chooses—companion, relic, or domain is forfeit until an epic quest.
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Mitigation:} Epic quests only; \SuitDiamond{} can delay collection one scene.

\section{Relationship Sinks}
\subsection{Betrayal Networks}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={CP Menu}]
\textbf{3 CP:} Start a \emph{Conspiracy} clock; name 2--3 rival nodes.\\
\textbf{4 CP:} Coordinated strike—multi-front assault; add a second \SuitClub{} to the leg.\\
\textbf{5+ CP:} Reveal a hidden ally’s turncoat; lose an Asset/Follower until exposed or redeemed.
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Mitigation:} Dismantle nodes one by one (hearts as roles/motives); penance scenes for the traitor.

\subsection{Loyalty Erosion}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={CP Menu}]
\textbf{2 CP:} Doubt—Follower acts at -1 effect this scene.\\
\textbf{3--4 CP:} \emph{Dissent} clock among your people (6). On fill: strike/flight.\\
\textbf{5+ CP:} Schism—split off a faction under your banner with inverted values.
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Mitigation:} Personal time, gifts, or shared risk; clear 2 segments with a dedicated scene.

\section{Meta Sinks}
\subsection{Narrative Weight (Legacy)}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={Rule}]
Log lasting outcomes in your \emph{Campaign Ledger}. High-tier CP spends that \/rewrite\/, not just shove, must be recorded as canon for future arcs.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Player Choice Limitation (Constraint)}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={CP Menu}]
\textbf{3 CP:} Remove a lawful option (e.g., a pass or permit) from future draws in this region until campaigned back.\\
\textbf{5+ CP:} Close a class of leverage (no \emph{escort} Diamonds function here) until a structural fix.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Campaign-Finale Grade}
\subsection{The Price of Power (Toll)}
Each use of a once/arc or once/campaign Talent adds 1 to a shared \emph{Toll} clock.
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={CP Menu}]
\textbf{3 CP:} The world balances a small book: collateral harm, lost ally, or new taboo.\\
\textbf{5+ CP:} Premise shift: the road, law, or magic behaves differently now (new core Front begins at 2/8).
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Crown of Thorns (Sacrifice)}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,sharp corners,boxrule=.6pt,title={Rule}]
When you win big, name what bleeds: gains in one domain \/mandate\/ loss in another. Cannot be mitigated; only redirected.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Integration Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Prestige Hooks:} 
  Cursed Child $\to$ feed \emph{Reputation Debt/Prophecy}. Stone-Speaker $\to$ \emph{Resonance/Toll}. Last Dauphin $\to$ \emph{Instability/Constraint}. Mist-Seer $\to$ \emph{Debt to Powers/Fate}. Foedus Keeper $\to$ \emph{Betrayal/Instability}.
  \item \textbf{Diamonds:} Show them face-up. High-tier CP spends interact by \emph{flipping debt}, \emph{suspending effect}, or \emph{inflating cost}. Players can plan but not dodge.
  \item \textbf{Worked Example (Zakov):} After playing \emph{Harbourmaster’s Indulgence}, spend \textbf{4 CP} to open an \emph{Admiralty Audit} (4) and mark \emph{Reputation Debt: Zakov} (2/6). The job pops; the debt lingers.
\end{itemize}
