\chapter{Tier IV and V Play}\index{Tier IV}\index{Tier V}\index{epic tier}

As characters reach Tier IV (Paragon) and Tier V (Mythic) levels, the scope of play expands dramatically. What once were local concerns become matters of regional, national, or even world-shaking importance. This chapter provides guidance for managing the unique challenges and opportunities that come with high-tier play.

\section{The Nature of High-Tier Play}\index{high-tier play}

At Tier IV and V, characters are no longer operating on the margins---they are movers and shakers. Their actions have visible, lasting impacts on the world. This shift requires the GM to think bigger, plan longer, and embrace the cascading consequences of player choices.
