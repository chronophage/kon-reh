\chapter{Enhanced GM Play}\index{enhanced GM play}

The Crown system becomes truly collaborative when the GM manages resources just like players, creating shared stakes and mutual investment in the narrative outcome. These enhanced mechanics transform you from storyteller to co-creator, with your own resources, relationships, and narrative economy.

\section{Resource Management}\index{resource management}

Track these key resources to enhance your GM experience and create more balanced gameplay.

\subsection{GM Relationship Management}\index{relationship management}

Just as players track relationship dice with NPCs, you should track relationship dice with major factions and key NPCs. This creates bidirectional engagement where both sides have stakes in interactions.

\subsubsection{Starting GM Relationships}\index{relationship management!starting}

Begin each campaign with 1-2 relationship dice per major faction:
\begin{itemize}
\item Political factions (nobility, merchants, clergy)
\item Criminal organizations (guilds, syndicates, pirates)
\item Military/civic authorities (guard, military, bureaucracy)
\item Supernatural entities (fae, undead, spirits)
\item Economic powers (merchant houses, guilds, trade consortiums)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Relationship Shifts}\index{relationship management!shifts}

GM relationship dice change based on player actions and world events:
\begin{itemize}
\item Successful player interaction with faction: GM may gain/lose relationship dice
\item Player betrayal of faction: GM gains relationship dice with antagonistic factions
\item Player aid to faction: GM may lose relationship dice with enemy factions
\item Faction initiatives: World events can shift relationships independently
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Bidirectional Rolls}\index{relationship management!bidirectional rolls}

When players interact with NPCs, both sides roll:
\begin{itemize}
\item Player rolls their relationship dice with the NPC
\item GM rolls their relationship dice with that faction
\item Results determine the \textbf{quality} of interaction, not just success/failure
\item High relationship dice can lead to unexpected aid or complications
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Shared Leverage Pool}\index{leverage pool}

Create a collaborative economy where helping each other becomes strategic.

\subsubsection{Pool Management}\index{leverage pool!management}

\begin{itemize}
\item Players contribute 1 leverage each to shared pool at session start
\item GM can spend from pool to enhance player successes or create interesting complications
\item Players can spend to bypass GM complications or enhance their own actions
\item Pool refreshes each session
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Spending Options}\index{leverage pool!spending}

\textbf{GM Spending:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 leverage: Add interesting detail to player success
\item 2 leverage: Create beneficial coincidence
\item 3+ leverage: Introduce major plot hook
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Player Spending:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 leverage: Avoid minor complication
\item 2 leverage: Gain advantage on next roll
\item 3+ leverage: Rewrite recent unfavorable outcome
\end{itemize}

\section{Campaign Tracking Systems}\index{campaign tracking}

Simple tracking mechanisms that enhance long-term play without complex bookkeeping.

\subsection{Faction Loyalty Tracker}\index{faction loyalty}

Track persistent world state through faction relationships.

\subsubsection{Loyalty Scale}\index{faction loyalty!scale}

Use a simple -3 to +3 scale for each major faction:
\begin{description}
\item[-3 Enemy:] Actively working against player interests
\item[-2 Hostile:] Will cause trouble when possible
\item[-1 Unfriendly:] Suspicious, unhelpful
\item[0 Neutral:] Indifferent to player actions
\item[+1 Friendly:] Helpful when convenient
\item[+2 Supportive:] Actively assist player goals
\item[+3 Ally:] Will sacrifice for player interests
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Loyalty Shifts}\index{faction loyalty!shifts}

Player actions shift faction loyalty:
\begin{itemize}
\item Major help: +1 to +2 loyalty
\item Minor help: +1 loyalty
\item Neutral actions: No change
\item Minor harm: -1 loyalty
\item Major harm: -1 to -2 loyalty
\item Betrayal: -2 to -3 loyalty
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Revelation Economy}\index{revelation economy}

Control information flow through mechanical budgeting.

\subsubsection{Budget Management}\index{revelation economy!budget}

\begin{itemize}
\item Each clock segment resolved = 1 revelation point
\item Major discoveries cost 1-3 revelation points
\item Players can "bank" unused revelation for future sessions
\item GM can "save" revelation for climax moments
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Revelation Costs}\index{revelation economy!costs}

\begin{description}
\item[1 Point:] Basic facts, surface details
\item[2 Points:] Strategic insights, tactical advantages
\item[3 Points:] Major revelations, plot-critical information
\end{description}

\subsection{Escalation Economy}\index{escalation economy}

Make tension management a player choice rather than imposed obstacle.

\subsubsection{Point System}\index{escalation economy!points}

\begin{itemize}
\item Start with 3 escalation points per conflict
\item Each escalation costs 1 point:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Add +1 dice to opposition
  \item Introduce new threat
  \item Complicate existing situation
  \end{itemize}
\item Players can spend 1 leverage to de-escalate or redirect
\item Points refresh per new conflict
\end{itemize}

\section{Collaborative Mechanics}\index{collaborative mechanics}

Mechanics that make players active participants in narrative creation.

\subsection{Complication Trading}\index{complication trading}

Allow players to request specific challenge types, making them active participants in narrative creation.

\subsubsection{Player Challenge Requests}\index{complication trading!challenge requests}

Players can request specific complication types:
\begin{itemize}
\item Social complications (feuds, negotiations, diplomacy)
\item Physical challenges (combat, exploration, survival)
\item Mystery elements (investigation, puzzles, hidden information)
\item Moral dilemmas (ethical conflicts, difficult choices)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Bargaining Process}\index{complication trading!bargaining}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Player declares desired complication type and spends leverage (1-2)

\item GM can spend relationship dice to enhance complications
\item Both sides benefit from engaging, invested complications
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Cross-Cultural Synergy}\index{cross-cultural synergy}

Encourage creative cross-cultural storytelling through mechanical rewards.

\section{Narrative First: Enhanced Tools Serve Story}\index{narrative first}

These enhanced mechanics are tools to deepen collaborative storytelling, not replace it. Use them when they enhance the fiction:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let relationships shift naturally through roleplay, not just dice
    \item Allow momentum to build through creative problem-solving
    \item Let cross-cultural connections emerge from player choices
    \item Use the Shared Leverage Pool to reward collaborative play
\end{itemize}

Remember: You are still the \textbf{weaver of consequences}. These tools simply give you and your players more ways to create meaningful, interconnected stories together.

The world of Fate's Edge responds to every action---and now, it responds to every \textbf{collaborative choice}.

Make it legendary, together.
