Fate’s Edge — GM Guide (Condensed)

This quick reference distills the GM-facing rules into a table-ready checklist. Positions in this edition are Dominant / Controlled / Desperate.

⸻

GM Philosophy
	•	Fiction first. Frame scenes with Position, Effect, and Stakes; let consequences flow from the fiction.  ￼
	•	Unified procedure. One consistent resolution loop handles travel, intrigue, combat, and magic.  ￼
	•	The GM’s mantra: set Position & rails, let the dice decide, spend Story Beats (SB), think in arcs.  ￼

⸻

Core Resolution Cycle
	1.	Declare action & approach (Attribute + Skill).
	2.	Set DV from narrative stakes.
	3.	Establish Position (Dominant / Controlled / Desperate).
	4.	Roll d10 pool; count successes (6+) and SB (1s); 10s count as 2 hits.
	5.	Apply the Outcome Matrix.
	6.	Spend/bank SB or draw from the Deck of Consequences.  ￼

Outcome Matrix (summary)
	•	Clean Success: grant intent, no extra friction.
	•	Success & Cost: intent + GM spends SB for complications.
	•	Partial: progress with gaps; player gains 1 Boon.
	•	Miss: no progress; GM escalates; player gains 2 Boons.  ￼

⸻

Position (Dominant / Controlled / Desperate)
	•	Dominant: on your terms; minor complications.
	•	Controlled: under pressure; failure has a cost.
	•	Desperate: odds against you; dramatic failure.  ￼

Position effects (at the table):
	•	Dominant: may re-roll one failure (below 6).
	•	Controlled: normal roll (no rerolls).
	•	Desperate: must re-roll one success (6+), keep the second result.  ￼

Caps & shifts:
	•	Bonuses can’t raise above Dominant; penalties can’t drop below Desperate. If capped, adjust DV/Effect instead.  ￼
	•	In combat, 1 SB can worsen Position one step; 1 Boon can improve it one step.  ￼

⸻

Setting DV (Difficulty Value)
	•	Baseline guideline: DV = Tier + 2 + modifiers; use to reflect narrative weight, not just mechanics.  ￼
	•	Typical ladder: DV 3 Routine, DV 4 Pressured, DV 5 Hard, DV 6+ Extreme.  ￼

⸻

Story Beats (SB) & the Deck
	•	SB come from rolled 1s; they power GM consequences and escalation.  ￼
	•	Direct spend (fast, reliable) vs Deck draw (min[Sb,3], thematic twist)—don’t do both for the same roll.  ￼
	•	Two deck tools with different suit meanings (Travel vs Consequences)—never mix suit meanings.  ￼
	•	SB budgets by tier (scene caps, thread counts) keep pacing bounded.  ￼

Quick spend menu (guide):
1 SB minor pressure; 2 SB moderate setback; 3 SB serious trouble; 4+ SB major turn.  ￼

⸻

Scene Framing Checklist
	•	State stakes (what changes on success / what bites on failure).
	•	Set Position (Dominant / Controlled / Desperate).
	•	Set DV (use the ladder).
	•	Name consequences you’re aiming for (SB spend or Deck suits).  ￼

⸻

Turn & Actions (any scene, including combat)
	•	Narrative initiative: spotlight follows the fiction; ambushers act first; keep it flexible.  ￼
	•	Common actions: Setup, Assist (spend 1 Boon for +1d), Defend/Protect, Interact, Channel/Weave (magic), Cast Rite/Song, Change Position.  ￼

⸻

Combat = Same Core Game
	•	Procedure: Set Position → Roll → Apply Outcome → Spend SB / Draw Deck.  ￼
	•	Position applications: Dominant (advantageous), Controlled (even odds), Desperate (severe consequences).  ￼
	•	Use tactical clocks (Overwhelm, Morale, Environmental) to track the wider fight.  ￼

⸻

Travel & Exploration (at a glance)

Treat each leg like a scene: frame stakes, set Position, assign DV, roll, spend SB; travel uses the same economy and can be rich with discovery instead of a skip.  ￼

⸻

Magic Integration (GM-facing)
	•	Spellcasting consequences feed the same SB economy; magic can shift Position, create clocks, or trigger Deck-driven fallout.  ￼
	•	Use fatigue/harm hooks to keep risk visible; integrate backlash as consequences rather than a separate subsystem.  ￼

⸻

Fail Forward & Boons

Every roll should matter: partials move the fiction; misses fuel escalation and hand players Boons for comeback plays.  ￼

⸻

Closing Rhythm

Guide with fiction, set Position & rails, embrace results, and spend SB to keep tension alive—the story emerges from this loop.  ￼
