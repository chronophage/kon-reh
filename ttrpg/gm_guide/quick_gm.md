s a cultist across open ground. Risk = standard danger (⇒ Risky). Impact = standard attack (⇒ Standard). Risky / Standard. Roll.

## 2. The Lazy DV Table

| DV | Use When | Example |
|----|----------|---------|
| 2 | Routine, low stakes | Pick a lock in a safe house |
| 3 | Pressured (default) | Pick a lock with guards nearby |
| 4 | Hard, hostile conditions | Pick a trapped arcane chest |
| 5+ | Extreme, dramatic risk | Pick a magical lock underwater |

**If in doubt: DV = 3.**

## 3. No-Thinking SB Spending

When players roll 1s, react instantly. Pick one option and move on:

#### 1 SB - Minor Complication
Noise, track left behind, small loss of gear, or tick a clock +1

#### 2 SB - Moderate Complication
Alarm raised, lose Position, broken tool, # Fate's Edge GM Quick-Kit

### The Director Mindset
You are not a rules engine. You are a director choosing the next shot:
- Clean win
- Costly win  
- Partial success
- Spiraling disaster

Use these tools to make fast decisions and keep the story moving.

## 1. Five-Second Position & Effect

### Risk Assessment
Ask: What is the Risk?
- **Controlled:** Safe, prepared, low threat
- **Risky (default):** Pressure, danger, uncertainty  
- **Desperate:** Immediate danger, overmatched, exposed

### Impact Assessment
Ask: What is the Impact?
- **Limited:** Partial progress or minor effect
- **Standard (default):** Normal success
- **Great:** Powerful, overwhelming, high-impact

**Example:** A player chargetougher foe, or tick a clock +2

#### 3+ SB - Major Complication
Reinforcements, collapsing terrain, ally endangered, or fill 3+ clock segments

**Never overthink it. One spend is enough.**

## 4. The Three-Clock Rule

Only three active clocks at once:
- **Scene Clock:** e.g., Guards Alerted [4]
- **Journey Clock:** e.g., Mist Encroaches [6]  
- **Campaign Clock:** e.g., Baron's Suspicion [8]

If a new complication appears, fold it into an existing clock. This keeps the table focused and the fiction tight.

## 5. Magic Adjudication Shortcut

If a player invents a spell on the fly:
1. Hear the intent
2. Assign a fitting TAG (Veil, Ward, Barrier, Glamour, etc.)
3. Pick DV based on scale:
   - Personal / Subtle = DV 2
   - Scene-wide / Strong = DV 3  
   - Area / Devastating = DV 4+
4. Choose Position based on danger while casting

**Example:** Creating a force wall under fire? TAG = Barrier, scale = Scene ⇒ DV 3. Casting in melee ⇒ Risky. Risky / Standard, DV 3. Roll.

## Prep Workflow

### Pre-Session (15 minutes)
1. Use Five-Second Position/Effect for major scenes
2. Apply Lazy DV Table to key challenges
3. Set up Three-Clock framework
4. Bank 2-3 SB spends per major scene
5. Prep 1-2 magic adjudications

### Session Management
- Keep mechanical resolution under 10 seconds
- Always spend SB immediately, don't hoard
- Never exceed three active clocks
- Reassess Position every major beat
