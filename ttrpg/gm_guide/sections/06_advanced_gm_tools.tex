\chapter{Advanced GM Techniques}\index{advanced techniques}

In \textbf{Fate's Edge}, as the campaign deepens and the stakes rise, the GM must evolve from storyteller to \textbf{architect of tension}. This chapter explores advanced techniques for managing complex scenes, faction interplay, and custom content creation. These tools will help you keep the world dynamic, the choices meaningful, and the consequences \textbf{echoing through the ages}.

\section*{Story Beat Management}\index{Story Beats!management}

The GM should manage Story Beat (SB) spending to maintain dramatic tension while preserving player agency and game flow. SB spending scales with character tier but is subject to hard limits to ensure playability and prevent narrative overload.

\subsection*{Core Principles}\index{Story Beats!core principles}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Narrative Coherence}: All SB spends within a scene should connect thematically, creating a cohesive story rather than random setbacks
    \item \textbf{Player Agency}: Complications create interesting choices, not insurmountable obstacles---always provide resolution paths
    \item \textbf{Progressive Escalation}: Higher tier characters naturally attract greater consequences that match their growing influence
    \item \textbf{Resolution Paths}: Every complication thread should have potential resolution through player action and creativity
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Spending Formula}\index{Story Beats!spending formula}
\textbf{Base SB = 4 + Character Tier}\index{Character Tier}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tier I (Rookie 0-40 XP)}: 5 SB base---local consequences, manageable threats
    \item \textbf{Tier II (Seasoned 41-90 XP)}: 6 SB base---regional impact, organized opposition
    \item \textbf{Tier III (Veteran 91-150 XP)}: 7 SB base---national consequences, strategic rivals
    \item \textbf{Tier IV (Paragon 151-220 XP)}: 8 SB base---continental scale, legendary challenges
    \item \textbf{Tier V (Mythic 221+ XP)}: 9 SB base---world-shaping events, mythic adversaries
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hard Limits}\index{Story Beats!hard limits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Standard Scenes}: Maximum 12 SB spending---maintains pace without overwhelming
    \item \textbf{Climactic Scenes}: Maximum 16 SB spending---allows for dramatic tension peaks
    \item \textbf{Active Threads}: Maximum (Tier + 1) concurrent threads---prevents narrative sprawl
    \item \textbf{Session Budget}: Maximum 20 SB total per session---ensures sustainable challenge
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Banked SB Integration}\index{Story Beats!banked integration}
Banked SB from character complications count toward scene spending limits rather than adding to available SB. This prevents exponential complication stacking while honoring narrative debt from previous choices and established character backgrounds.

\subsection*{Thread Management}\index{threads!management}
Complication threads follow a natural escalation pattern that creates satisfying narrative arcs:

\begin{fatebox}[Complication Thread Escalation Pattern]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Thread Level} & \textbf{SB Escalation and Narrative Impact} \\
\midrule
First Exposure & 1-2 SB (Minor inconvenience that introduces the complication) \\
Second Occurrence & 2-4 SB (Moderate setback that develops the thread) \\
Third Strike & 3-6 SB (Major consequence that brings the thread to climax) \\
Resolution & Thread concludes with narrative payoff and character growth \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\begin{fatebox}[Story Beat Management by Tier]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lXXXXX}
\toprule
\textbf{Tier} & \textbf{Base SB} & \textbf{Max Threads} & \textbf{Scene Cap} & \textbf{Climax Cap} & \textbf{Session Budget} \\
\midrule
I (0-40 XP) & 5 SB & 2 threads & 12 SB & 16 SB & 20 SB \\
II (41-90 XP) & 6 SB & 3 threads & 12 SB & 16 SB & 20 SB \\
III (91-150 XP) & 7 SB & 4 threads & 12 SB & 16 SB & 20 SB \\
IV (151-220 XP) & 8 SB & 5 threads & 12 SB & 16 SB & 20 SB \\
V (221+ XP) & 9 SB & 6 threads & 12 SB & 16 SB & 20 SB \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\begin{fatebox}[Complication Spending Safety Guidelines]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Scenario} & \textbf{Guidance and Best Practices} \\
\midrule
Standard Scenes & Spend 50-75\% of available SB budget; preserve some for escalation and player adaptation \\
Climactic Scenes & May use full SB allocation; ensure resolution opportunities and meaningful choices remain \\
Teaching Moments & Explicit player consent required; time-limited complications; thorough debrief afterward \\
New Players & Reduce SB spending by 25-50\%; focus on clear, actionable complications with obvious solutions \\
Grimdark Mode & Reserved for veteran groups; requires explicit session zero discussion; safety tools always active \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\section*{Mastering the Deck of Consequences}\index{Deck of Consequences}

The \textbf{Deck of Consequences} is more than a randomizer---it is a \textbf{thematic engine} that externalizes risk and ensures that setbacks feel consistent, fair, and deeply integrated with your campaign's unique atmosphere.

\subsection*{Two Deck Systems (Compatibility)}\index{Deck of Consequences!two deck systems}

Fate's Edge uses two distinct card tools that serve different narrative purposes:

\begin{fatebox}[Deck System Comparison]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Deck Type} & \textbf{Purpose and Suit Meanings} \\
\midrule
Travel Decks (regional, 52-card) & Spade=Place, Heart=Actor, Club=Pressure, Diamond=Leverage. Powers journeys and geographic challenges \\
Deck of Consequences (scene drama) & Hearts=social fallout, Spades=harm/escalation, Clubs=material cost, Diamonds=magical/spiritual disturbance \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\textit{Critical Guidance:} Never mix suit meanings across decks. When a rule references ``Spade/Club/Diamond,'' it means \emph{Travel Deck}. When it says ``Hearts/Spades/Clubs/Diamonds,'' it means \emph{Consequences Deck}.

\subsection*{When to Draw}\index{Deck of Consequences!when to draw}

After a roll generates Story Beats, the GM faces a strategic choice:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct Spend}: Translate SB into immediate consequences/rail ticks---fast, reliable, maintains pacing
    \item \textbf{Deck Draw}: Draw up to \textbf{min(SB, 3)} cards and \textbf{synthesize a single twist} guided by suit and highest rank---rich, thematic, introduces novelty
\end{itemize}

Never do both for the same roll. If a drawn card contradicts established fiction, reinterpret creatively or redraw to maintain thematic consistency.

\subsection*{Structure of the Deck}\index{Deck of Consequences!structure}

\begin{fatebox}[Deck of Consequences Structure Guide]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Description and Application} \\
\midrule
Hearts Suit & Emotional, social, or relational fallout---betrayals, misunderstandings, emotional wounds \\
Spades Suit & Harm, danger, or escalation of conflict---injuries, reinforcements, tactical disadvantages \\
Clubs Suit & Resource strain, economic or material cost---broken gear, lost supplies, financial setbacks \\
Diamonds Suit & Magical, spiritual, or cosmic disturbances---backlash, omens, supernatural complications \\
Ace-3 (Minor) & Inconvenience or flavor complication that adds texture without major impact \\
4-6 (Moderate) & Setback with narrative teeth that requires player attention and response \\
7-9 (Significant) & Consequence altering the course of action with lasting implications \\
10-King (Major) & Major fallout introducing new problems or lasting scars that change the story \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\begin{fatebox}[Complication Application Methods: GM Decision Guide]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lXXX}
\toprule
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{When to Use} & \textbf{Benefits} & \textbf{Typical Session Use} \\
\midrule
Direct Spend (70\%) & Routine actions, combat, quick resolution & Fast resolution, consistent pacing, reliable complications & Investigation, travel, standard challenges \\
Deck Draw (30\%) & Major revelations, character moments, climaxes & Thematic richness, unique complications, player surprise & Plot twists, discoveries, emotional scenes \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\begin{fatebox}[Session Phase Application Guidelines]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lXXX}
\toprule
\textbf{Campaign Phase} & \textbf{Recommended Ratio} & \textbf{Resolution Time} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
Early Game (Exploration) & 80/20 & 3 seconds & Quick resolution maintains investigation flow and momentum \\
Mid Game (Development) & 70/30 & 5 seconds & Balanced approach supports rising tension with meaningful pivots \\
Late Game (Climax) & 50/50 to 40/60 & 8 seconds & Maximum impact complications for story resolution \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\section*{Advanced Travel and Exploration}\index{travel}\index{exploration}

Travel in Fate's Edge is not a downtime skip---it is a \textbf{narrative layer} filled with tension, discovery, and risk that reveals the world's character through every mile crossed.

\subsection*{Core Travel Procedure}\index{travel!core procedure}

For each leg of a journey, draw 3--4 cards using the decks for your destination and controlling authority:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spade} from the destination deck: sets the scene (place)---the physical and cultural landscape
    \item \textbf{Heart} from the destination deck: introduces the local actor or faction---who they meet and why it matters
    \item \textbf{Club} from the Wilds or destination: brings pressure---what challenges the journey itself
    \item \textbf{Diamond} from the authority that gates the route: papers, escorts, rights, or exceptions---the bureaucratic landscape
\end{itemize}

Set a travel clock by the highest rank:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2--5} → 4 segments (brief, intense journeys)
    \item \textbf{6--10} → 6 segments (standard expedition length)
    \item \textbf{J/Q/K} → 8 segments (extended, epic travels)
    \item \textbf{Ace} → 10 segments (campaign-defining voyages)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example}: Traveling the \textbf{Aelerian Passes} in deep winter, the PCs draw: Spade (Avalanche gallery---treacherous narrow path), Heart (Geometer---mapmaker with secret knowledge), Club (Engineer requisition---military demands), Diamond (Underway Pass---ancient right of passage). Clock: 8 segments. On a failed navigation roll, the GM spends SB to trigger a rockslide---Hazard +2 that threatens to bury the path entirely.

\section*{Faction Dynamics and Grand Strategy}\index{factions}

Factions are \textbf{living entities} with goals, rivals, and shifting loyalties. They are not static backdrops---they are \textbf{active players in the story} whose movements shape the campaign's grand narrative.

\subsection*{Creating Memorable Factions}\index{factions!creating}

Each faction should have distinct personality and concrete capabilities:

\begin{fatebox}[Faction Creation Template]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Element} & \textbf{Development Guidelines} \\
\midrule
Core Motive & What they fundamentally want---territory, ideology, survival, power, knowledge \\
Key Figures & Who leads or represents them---names, personalities, ambitions, vulnerabilities \\
Resources & What they can bring to bear---military, economic, social, magical assets \\
Weaknesses & What makes them vulnerable---internal divisions, external pressures, resource limitations \\
Relationship Map & How they connect to other factions---allies, rivals, neutrals, complicated histories \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\subsection*{Faction Clocks and Grand Strategy}\index{factions!clocks}

Track factional pressure with clocks that represent their changing fortunes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rising Influence} (6): Gaining power, allies, or territory---momentum is building
    \item \textbf{Internal Strife} (6): Leadership challenged, morale low---fractures appear
    \item \textbf{Public Scandal} (4): Reputation damaged, support wanes---trust evaporates
    \item \textbf{Strategic Initiative} (8): Controlling the narrative and setting terms of engagement
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example}: The \textbf{Viterra Dawn Knights} gain Rising Influence as they rally to the new Queen's banner---but suffer Internal Strife as old commanders resist her modernizing reforms, creating tension between tradition and progress.

\section*{Creating Custom Content and House Rules}\index{custom content}

Fate's Edge thrives on \textbf{player agency} and \textbf{world customization}. When designing new Talents, Assets, or Prestige Abilities, follow these principles to maintain balance while encouraging creativity.

\textbf{Talents are the building blocks of character specialization. They represent learned techniques, supernatural gifts, or cultural inheritances. Each Talent costs XP, and their costs are tied to impact. Only one talent can be active at a time unless otherwise specified}

\subsection*{Designing Balanced Talents}\index{Talents!designing}

\begin{fatebox}[Talent Design Guidelines by Tier]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Tier} & \textbf{Design Principles and XP Cost Guidelines} \\
\midrule
General Talents (2-4 XP) & Simple benefits that enhance core capabilities without complexity \\
Cultural Talents (4-6 XP) & Thematic abilities tied to specific backgrounds or training \\
Prestige Abilities (6+ XP) & Campaign-defining powers requiring significant investment and narrative milestones \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\textbf{Talents are the building blocks of character specialization. They represent learned techniques, supernatural gifts, or cultural inheritances. Each Talent costs XP, and their costs are tied to impact. Only one talent can be active at a time unless otherwise specified}
\subsection*{Example Talent Designs}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Battle Instincts} (6 XP): Once per scene, re-roll a failed defense roll---honed reflexes saving from certain disaster
    \item \textbf{Silver Tongue} (4 XP): Gain +1 die when persuading or deceiving through speech---words that charm and manipulate
    \item \textbf{Stone-Sense} (Dwarves, 5 XP): Detect flaws in stone or earth; gain +1 die on Engineering or Craft rolls underground---ancestral connection to the deep places
    \item \textbf{Blood Memory} (Ykrul, 5 XP): After a battle, meditate to gain one temporary Skill die reflecting a foe's tactics---learning through spilled blood
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Designing Meaningful Assets}\index{Assets!designing}

\begin{fatebox}[Asset Design Framework]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Asset Tier} & \textbf{Scope and Narrative Impact} \\
\midrule
Minor (4 XP) & Local influence---safehouse, petty title, small shop with limited reach \\
Standard (8 XP) & Regional impact---spy ring, charter, workshop with measurable influence \\
Major (12 XP) & National scale---fortress lease, mercantile network, institution with lasting presence \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

Each Asset should include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Activation Cost}: Typically 1 Boon for on-screen effect
    \item \textbf{Scope}: Clear boundaries on what it can plausibly accomplish
    \item \textbf{Fictional Hook}: Why it exists in the world and how it was obtained
    \item \textbf{Condition Track}: How it degrades or improves with use and attention
\end{itemize}

Social Rails & Curfew (time pressure), Crowd (witness management), Sanctity (cultural restrictions) \\
Physical Rails & Hazard (environmental dangers), Hunt (pursuit escalation), Escape (exit strategy) \\
GM Philosophy & Let players plan thoroughly but make the world react realistically---guards change, nobles arrive early, systems update \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\subsection*{Political Intrigue and Social Conflict}\index{political intrigue}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Leverage}: Diamonds and social rails determine influence in courtly settings
    \item \textbf{Allies and Rivals}: Represented by Assets and Followers with their own agendas
    \item \textbf{Public Image}: Tied directly to Mandate and Crisis clocks---reputation is currency
    \item \textbf{Information Economy}: Secrets become tangible assets with measurable value
\end{itemize}

\section*{Advanced Magic and Supernatural Challenges}\index{magic!advanced}

\subsection*{Magic Duels and Arcane Confrontations}\index{combat!magic duels}

High-stakes magical combat requires special considerations that honor both the power and the peril of arcane arts:

\begin{fatebox}[Magic Duel Framework]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Element} & \textbf{Special Considerations} \\
\midrule
Counterspelling & Interrupting opponent's Casting Loop requires precise timing and significant risk \\
Backlash Cascade & Multiple casters generate SB that can create compound complications \\
Environmental Magic & Terrain-altering spells change the battlefield with lasting consequences \\
Elemental Opposition & Fire vs Water, Earth vs Air, Fate vs Luck---opposites create dramatic tension \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\subsection*{Supernatural Investigations}\index{supernatural investigations}

When the party confronts mysteries beyond mortal understanding:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clue-Based Progression}: Information becomes the primary resource
    \item \textbf{Sanity and Corruption}: Exposure to the unnatural has measurable effects
    \item \textbf{Ritual Timelines}: Some threats operate on schedules beyond human comprehension
    \item \textbf{Reality Bleed}: The supernatural leaks into the mundane world with subtle signs
\end{itemize}

% Resource Guide Subsection: Disabling Magical Traps (Wards)

\subsection{Disabling Magical Traps (Wards)}\label{subsec:disabling-wards}
\index{Wards}\index{Traps}\index{DV}\index{Position}\index{Clocks}\index{Story Beats}

Wards are traps encoded in magic: a binding, sensor, or anchored effect. Treat them like any obstacle: \textbf{state the fiction}, \textbf{set Position}, and \textbf{resolve against DV}. This subsection expands the SRD example with GM-facing tools: how to set DV from fiction, what good/bad results look like, and how to keep the scene moving.

\paragraph{Structure (at the table).}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Step~\arabic*:}, leftmargin=2.1em]
\item \textbf{Name the Ward.} What does it sense (heat, oath-breaking, Patron presence)? What does it do (alarm, bind, blast, invert gravity)? Where is the \emph{anchor} (sigil, keystone, idol, threshold)?
\item \textbf{Reveal Handles.} Offer at least two fictional levers: the arcane pattern (\emph{Arcana}), the mechanism/anchor (\emph{Tinker}), and the approach route (\emph{Agility/Move}). Tools, components, or Patron symbols count as handles.
\item \textbf{Set Position \textrightarrow{} DV.} Use the ladder as defaults; shift for scale/urgency.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dominant} (time, tools, clear access): \textbf{DV2}.
\item \textbf{Controlled} (pressure, partial access): \textbf{DV3}.
\item \textbf{Desperate} (activating, hostile field): \textbf{DV~4–5+}.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Declare Stakes.} What happens on Partial/Miss? Name the \emph{Ward Clock} and the \emph{Alert Clock} up front if relevant.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Common Ward Types & Anchors.}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{>{\bfseries}l >{\raggedright}X >{\raggedright}X}
\toprule
Type & Trigger & Anchor Examples \
\midrule
Sentry & Crossing a threshold, line of sight, sound cadence & Lintel sigil, eye-gem, bell filament \
Binding & Handling an item, touching a seal, oath breach & Wax seal, chain knot, iron brand \
Punitive & Trespass + time window, named rival, taboo action & Idol tooth, ash sigil under rug, curse knot \
Displacement & Path inversion, gravity twist, dream-step & Floor mandala, mirrored post, sleep pin \
Anti-Magic & Casting in zone, symbol presence, boon use & Null plate, cold-iron frame, void ampoule \
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\paragraph{Approaches & Aids (examples).}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Wits + Arcana:} analyze glyph grammar; ground the loop with salt/ink; counter-frequency hum.
\item \textbf{Wits + Tinker:} wedge the keystone; snip hair-thin filament; re-route power to a safe sink.
\item \textbf{Body + Agility:} thread the safe arc; pin the pressure plate; time the chime cadence.
\item \textbf{Teamwork:} one character steadies Position with tools while another rolls; assistants may accept \textbf{1~SB} to grant +1d once.
\item \textbf{Talents/Tools:} lockpicks, ward-ink, tuning forks, mirror-shards; Patron symbols might improve Position if thematically aligned.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Clocks that Matter.}
\begin{description}[leftmargin=1.6em]
\item[\textsc{Ward Integrity} (4):] how close the binding is to disarming \emph{or} rupturing. On Partials, tick 1; on Misses, tick 2.
\item[\textsc{Alerted Attention} (4):] nearby guardians, spirits, or owners notice tampering.
\item[\textsc{Escalation} (4/6):] punitive effects ramp (more Harm, broader area, additional tags).
\end{description}

\paragraph{Outcomes Palette (use or adapt).}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Strong Hit:} Ward disabled/redirected cleanly; optionally \emph{bank a tell} (learn its signature for later).
\item \textbf{Mixed:} Suppressed but \emph{unstable}; pick one: tick \textsc{Alerted Attention}~+1, apply minor Backlash by element/Patron, or leave a trace (future complication).
\item \textbf{Miss:} Ward holds or triggers; GM may (a) advance \textsc{Ward Integrity} toward rupture, (b) trigger a reduced effect now, (c) spend SB to introduce a hard complication.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Counter-Ward (Arcana Focus; optional).}
On a Success, choose one: (1) \textbf{Suppress} for a scene; (2) \textbf{Disarm} permanently (mark +1 Obligation or expend rare material); (3) \textbf{Invert} (redirect first trigger to a designated sink; start \textsc{Unintended Echo}~1/4).

\paragraph{Difficulty Dials.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Scale:} Large areas or ancient wards add +1 DV or an extra clock.
\item \textbf{Haste:} Rushed attempts worsen Position one step.
\item \textbf{Right of Names:} Knowing the warder’s true name improves Position one step or grants +1d.
\item \textbf{Wrong Patron:} Symbols from an opposed Patron impose –1d or +1 DV (GM call).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Fiction First Hooks.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show sensory tells (ozone, cold breath, hair standing) before rolls.
\item On Partials, change the room: new cover lines, heat shimmer, dead zones for boons.
\item On Miss, give a choice: suffer a lesser effect now to avoid full trigger later, or press on and risk rupture.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Worked Mini-Example.}
\emph{Vault Sentry (DV 3, Controlled).} Anchor: eye-gem in an idol. The crew uses Wits+Tinker with ward-ink and a mirror shard. Mixed result: \textsc{Ward Integrity}+1, \textsc{Alerted Attention}+1, but the beam is shunted for this scene. Later a rival recognizes the mirror signature—payoff for the trace left behind.

% SRD Insert: Optional Player-Character Death Rules

\section{Optional Player-Character Death}\label{sec:pc-death-optional}
\index{Death}\index{Last Stand}\index{Death Clock}\index{Patron’s Claim}\index{Inheritance}\index{Resurrection}

By default, Fate’s Edge treats death as rare and dramatic. Use any of the following modules (singly or in combination) to tune how lethal your table feels. All options respect \textbf{Story Beats (SB)} and \textbf{Obligation} as core currencies.

\subsection*{Baseline (Default)}\label{subsec:death-baseline}
PCs do not die on ordinary failures. Instead, they suffer \textbf{Harm}, Conditions, lost opportunities, or narrative costs. Death only occurs when a rule below is in play or the table agrees a scene warrants it.

\subsection*{Option A — Severe Harm Death}\label{subsec:death-severe}
\textbf{Trigger.} When a PC would take a \textbf{third} instance of Severe Harm (or escalate past the top of your harm track), they instead face death.\par
\textbf{Stave It Off.} The player may avoid death by choosing one: (1) mark \textbf{2 SB} \emph{and} take a \textsc{Maimed} permanent Condition, (2) accept a \textbf{Patron’s Claim} (see OptionD), or (3) convert the blow into a \textbf{Last Stand} (OptionC).

\subsection*{Option B — Death Clock}\label{subsec:death-clock}
\textbf{Trigger.} Catastrophic consequences (falls, crushes, mortal wounds) fill a named \textbf{Death Clock} (4 or 6 ticks).\par
\textbf{While Ticking.} Actions that stabilize reduce the clock; taking further punishment advances it.\par
\textbf{When Full.} The character dies unless one of the following occurs immediately: spend \textbf{2 SB} to hold at full (buy a single action), accept a \textbf{Patron’s Claim}, or another PC succeeds at \emph{Pull From the Brink} (risky, effect = clock –2 on success).

\subsection*{Option C — Last Stand}\label{subsec:last-stand}
\textbf{Trigger.} On lethal harm or a full Death Clock, the player may declare a \textbf{Last Stand}.\par
\textbf{Effect.} For the remainder of the scene, the PC acts with \textbf{+1 effect} and ignores new Harm. Each action automatically creates \textbf{1 SB}. When the scene ends, the character \textbf{dies} unless a \textbf{miracle} is secured (Patron rite, relic, or equivalent).

\subsection*{Option D — Patron’s Claim}\label{subsec:patron-claim}
\textbf{Trigger.} On death, the PC’s Patron (or a circling power) intervenes.\par
\textbf{Bargain.} The GM offers 1–3 \non-negotiable terms (e.g., \emph{Obligation +2}, \emph{forfeit a Gift}, \emph{become a vessel for a season}). If accepted, the PC lives; mark the costs immediately and record the \textbf{Claim} as an ongoing front. Refusal means the death proceeds.\par
\textbf{Note.} Claims should change the campaign; use sparingly.

\subsection*{Option E — Dramatic Exit & Inheritance}\label{subsec:inheritance}
\textbf{Dramatic Exit.} The player may choose a meaningful death that resolves a question or saves others.\par
\textbf{Inheritance.} The next PC created by that player inherits one of: (a) a \textbf{Relationship} (bond, contact, or rival), (b) a \textbf{Tool} (asset degraded one step), or (c) a \textbf{Lesson} (start with +1 XP toward a Talent used in the exit). Record how the world remembers them.

\subsection*{Option F — Return From Beyond}\label{subsec:return}
\textbf{Trigger.} A body, a name, and a path (rite, gate, bargain).\par
\textbf{Cost.} Treat as a High Rite with Obligation appropriate to the transgression. Set DV using \S\ref{sec:rites-dv-expanded}. On success, the PC returns \textbf{changed}: apply a \textsc{Scar} (permanent Condition) and \textbf{1 SB} to the rescuer. On failure, choose: lose the body, or return with a Patron’s Claim.

\subsection*{Table Safety}\label{subsec:death-safety}
Always confirm that \textbf{PC death is on the table} before a session begins. Use lines/veils or your safety tools; offer \textbf{Dramatic Exit} in place of surprise death if needed.

\subsection*{GM Guidance}\label{subsec:death-gm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Name the Stakes.} Before lethal rolls, state clearly which option(s) are available.
\item \textbf{Tie to Themes.} Death, Claims, and Returns should echo the Patron’s domain (e.g., Ikasha’s shadow vigil, Mykkiel’s writ of reprieve).
\item \textbf{One Big Choice.} Offer a single fork at the brink (Last Stand, Claim, or Exit) rather than all at once to preserve drama.
\item \textbf{Make It Matter.} Death or survival should change clocks, factions, and future scenes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Quick Picks},colback=gray!5,colframe=black]
\small \textbf{Low lethality:} Baseline + Death Clock only.\quad \textbf{Heroic tragedy:} Severe Harm Death + Last Stand + Inheritance.\quad \textbf{Dark bargains:} Any combo with Patron’s Claim.\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Narrative First: The World Remembers}\index{narrative first}

In Fate's Edge, the world is not a puzzle to be solved---it is a \textbf{living system} that responds to player choices with consequences that ripple across time and space. Let factions shift their allegiances based on player actions. Let consequences accumulate like stones in a riverbed, gradually shaping the flow of history itself. And above all---let the story unfold organically from the collision of player ambition and world reaction.

Because in the end, it is not the GM who writes the legend that will echo through the ages.

It is the players, through their choices, sacrifices, and triumphs.

You simply hold the quill that records their epic.

And what an honor that is.

\section{Poison as Story Beats (Narrative \texorpdfstring{$\leftrightarrow$}{↔} Mechanics)}\label{sec:poison-sb}
\index{Poison}\index{Story Beats}\index{Fatigue}\index{Harm}\index{Clocks}\index{Conditions}

Poison is best when it \emph{pushes scenes forward} rather than only dealing damage. This module frames poison as \textbf{Fatigue-forward}, with \textbf{Story Beats (SB)} powering escalation.

\subsection*{Core Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Primary Effect:} Poison applies \textbf{Fatigue} (not Harm) unless it explicitly says otherwise.
\item \textbf{Escalation:} The GM may \textbf{spend 1 SB} created in the scene to upgrade a poison instance: \emph{Fatigue} (\to) \emph{Condition} (\to) \emph{Harm}. Name the fiction of the escalation (spasms, fever spike, airway closing).
\item \textbf{Clocks:} Use a named clock per poison (e.g., \textsc{Neurotoxin Load} 1/4). Ticks convert into Fatigue/Conditions at thresholds.
\item \textbf{Resist:} Players may Resist poison normally; strong fiction (antidote, mask, purge rite) can reduce Position or cancel a tick.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Delivery \& Position}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{>{\bfseries}l l X}
\toprule
Route & Base DV & Position Cues \
\midrule
Contact & 2 & Sweat, numbness, rashes; Dominant with gloves/time. \
Ingested & 3 & Bitter note, wine film; Controlled at table, Dominant in lab. \
Inhaled & 3--4 & Perfume cloud, dust motes; Desperate in confined spaces. \
Injury/Venom & 3--4 & Fanged strike, tainted blade; Controlled unless braced/prepared. \
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\subsection*{Outcomes Palette}
\begin{description}[leftmargin=1.6em]
\item[\textbf{Strong Hit.}] Avoid or purge: clear \textsc{Poison Clock} by 1 and ignore the current instance.
\item[\textbf{Mixed.}] Mark \textbf{Fatigue +1} \emph{or} take a minor \textbf{Condition} (\textsc{Dizzy}, \textsc{Shaking}). GM may tick the \textsc{Poison Clock} +1.
\item[\textbf{Miss.}] Mark \textbf{Fatigue +1} and tick \textsc{Poison Clock} +1–2. The GM may spend SB to apply a stronger Condition \emph{or} escalate to \textbf{Harm 1}.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Conversion \& Interactions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fatigue → Harm.} Normal Fatigue overflow still converts per your health rules (see \S\ref{sec:health-fatigue-harm-rev}).
\item \textbf{Armor.} Armor rarely helps vs. contact/ingested poisons; vs. \emph{injury} delivery, apply armor before poison unless the blade is \textbf{Barbed/Venomous} (tag), which bypasses one step of conversion.
\item \textbf{Rites.} \emph{Purge} (\S\ref{sec:universal-rituals}) clears 1–2 ticks or downgrades Condition \textrightarrow{} Fatigue (GM sets Obligation).
\item \textbf{Patrons.} Poison from a Patron-aligned source may trigger thematic backlash or Claims when resisted.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{SB Dials for GMs}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pressure Valve (soft).} Spend SB to \emph{delay} catastrophic onset: tick clock instead of immediate Harm, but widen the threat.
\item \textbf{Spike (hard).} Spend SB to \emph{frontload} impact: apply a named Condition now (\textsc{Blind}, \textsc{Cramping}) or force a risky reposition.
\item \textbf{Echo.} Bank 1 SB to trigger a delayed complication (e.g., relapse during negotiations).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Sample Poisons}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{>{\bfseries}l X X}
\toprule
Name & Primary Effect (on hit) & SB-Driven Escalation \
\midrule
Bitterglass & Fatigue +1; breath tastes like copper. & 1 SB: \textsc{Dizzy}. 2 SB: Harm 1 (air hunger). \
Widowroot & Fatigue +1; numb grip. & 1 SB: drop held item. 2 SB: \textsc{Shaking}. \
Dream-Marrow & Fatigue +1; slow recall. & 1 SB: \textsc{Fogged} (–1 to memory). 2 SB: \textsc{Asleep} unless shaken. \
Serpent’s Borrow & Fatigue +1; swelling puncture. & 1 SB: \textsc{Cramping}. 2 SB: Harm 1 unless pressure bandaged. \
Courtier’s Kiss & Fatigue +1; sweet aftertaste. & 1 SB: \textsc{Swayed} (–1 vs. social manipulation). 2 SB: \textsc{Blurred Vision}. \
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\subsection*{Worked Micro-Example}
\emph{Gala Balcony.} Inhaled perfume trap (DV~3, Controlled). Mixed: PC marks Fatigue +1; GM ticks \textsc{Poison Clock}+1. Later, during the toast, the GM spends 1 SB to apply \textsc{Dizzy}; the PC chooses to lean on a friend (creating a bond) rather than push through and risk Harm.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Summary},colback=gray!5,colframe=black]
\small Poison leans on \textbf{Fatigue} first. \textbf{SB} lets the GM pace escalation as the scene demands. Name the clock, show the tells, and let fiction lead the effect.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Optional Rule: Multi-Character Followers}
\label{sec:multi-character-followers}

\subsection*{Overview}
A player may control multiple characters by linking them as mutual Followers. This option also covers absent players' characters when consent is given.

\subsection*{Core Mechanics}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cap Tier +1:} A Follower may advance up to one Tier higher than their leader’s current Tier.
  \item \textbf{Multi-Character Play:} A player may designate two PCs as Followers of each other. Only one is the \emph{active} PC at a time; the other functions as a Follower.
  \item \textbf{Absent PCs:} With consent, an absent player’s PC may be run as a temporary Follower at Cap~Tier +1.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Switching Active Characters}
\label{sec:switching-active-characters}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Switch Cost:} When switching, the previously active PC immediately becomes a Follower of the new active PC at Cap~Tier +1.  
  \item \textbf{Condition Gate:} A PC cannot be switched \emph{to} if Compromised, Seized, or otherwise narratively unfit for active duty.  
  \item \textbf{Narrative Justification:} The fiction must support the switch (returning from a journey, recovering from harm, taking point for a specific task).  
  \item \textbf{Strategic Choice:} Switching trades autonomy for support—gaining a powerful Follower but losing a full PC.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Balance Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prevents abuse by making switching itself the cost.  
  \item Maintains narrative logic—leadership shifts naturally reshape party structure.  
  \item Creates strategic depth—switching is a meaningful tactical decision.  
  \item Keeps all characters relevant, encouraging upkeep even when not active.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-Summoner Scenarios}
\label{subsec:multi-summoner-scenarios}

When multiple Pact-Whisperers operate within the same party, the GM must balance narrative pacing, resource tension, and spotlight time. A three-summoner group creates a dynamic ecosystem of spirits, commands, and coordination that highlights Fate’s Edge’s distributed cognition design.

\paragraph{Core Principles.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Distributed Cognition:} Treat each summoner as a node of expertise. They manage their own spirit’s leash, but the group collectively drives story momentum through overlapping actions.
  \item \textbf{Tension by Degrees:} Maintain visible Leash clocks. Half-filled clocks are narrative warnings (heat shimmer, voice echo, wind strain). Filled clocks should escalate story stakes, not merely end control.
  \item \textbf{Position Flow:} Use Position as the balancing lever. Cooperative positioning between spirits and mortals determines tempo, not raw power.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{GM Tools for Multi-Spirit Play.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Visible Leash Tracking:} Display Leash clocks for each active spirit. This keeps the tension transparent and helps players self-regulate.
  \item \textbf{Free Sustain Action:} Each summoner gains one free “Sustain” command per round to maintain prior orders without ticking the Leash. Active commands or redirections still require an Action.
  \item \textbf{Boon Economy Hooks:} Encourage cross-summoner Boon trades as in-fiction gestures of focus-sharing, divine resonance, or ritual synchrony. It reinforces teamwork.
  \item \textbf{Narrative Strain:} Whenever multiple Leashes fill within the same scene, create environmental consequences: resonance quakes, time distortions, fog bursts, or Patron echoes.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Encounter Design.}
Design encounters around \textbf{shared objectives} rather than discrete fights. Each summoner can anchor a dimension of the scene:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Social Summoner:} Improves Position and negotiation leverage through bound entities.
  \item \textbf{Combat Summoner:} Anchors tactical threat control and battlefield tempo.
  \item \textbf{Utility Summoner:} Expands environmental influence, stabilizing hazards or solving magical puzzles.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example: The Merchant’s Dilemma.}
In a multi-summoner playtest, three summoners coordinated to solve a single crisis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Session 1:} Social summoner negotiated trade peace via a Cap~1 \textit{Sylph}. 
  \item \textbf{Session 2:} Combat summoner’s Cap~3 \textit{Berserker} held off cursed creatures. 
  \item \textbf{Session 3:} Utility summoner’s \textit{Construct} and \textit{Earth Elemental} stabilized a collapsing shrine. 
\end{itemize}
Each maintained different Leashes (\textit{Cap + Command})—6–8 segments—sustaining spirits for 6–10 rounds before departure. The result was natural pacing and tangible escalation without bookkeeping.

\paragraph{Narrative Balance.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Spotlight Rotation:} Shift scene framing—one summoner leads each major beat. 
  \item \textbf{Cascade Effects:} If multiple Leashes break simultaneously, narrate a combined phenomenon (overlapping etheric resonance or backlash storm).
  \item \textbf{Scaling Complexity:} Introduce coordinated Leash management as optional at Tier~III+. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{GM Guidance Summary.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Keep spirit autonomy visible and narratively meaningful.
  \item Tie consequences to the environment, not just the summoner.
  \item Let cooperation reshape the battlefield instead of multiplying turns.
  \item Use Story Beats from spirit actions to fuel ongoing complications.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Design Intent.}
A multi-summoner scenario tests the game’s collaborative depth. The goal is not to balance power, but to balance story agency—each summoner’s authority reshapes reality in their own way, and the GM’s role is to let those harmonics build rather than cancel.

\subsection*{Terrestrial Patrons}
Not all patrons are gods, demons, or cosmic forces. Mortals create power too: nobles, guilds, conspiracies, temples, syndicates, and commanders. A Terrestrial Patron represents an ongoing relationship with a powerful mortal faction.

\begin{description}[leftmargin=*]
\item[\textbf{Why They Matter}]
A terrestrial patron doesn't grant magic. They grant \emph{leverage}: protection, resources, sanctuary, information, and political shifts. Their rewards arrive through fiction and consequence.

\item[\textbf{Obligation (Terrestrial)}]
Use the same Obligation track, but the consequences are social, legal, or economic instead of supernatural.

When you call on a Patron's influence, add +1 Obligation.

\item[\textbf{Getting a Patron}]
To gain a Terrestrial Patron, complete one of the following:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item a major job for them,
\item a sworn Oath,
\item legal or financial binding,
\item blackmail or shared crime.
\end{itemize}

Mark them on your sheet and write one sentence:
\textit{``They want me because \_\_\_''}

\item[\textbf{Perks}]
Each Patron offers 2--3 repeatable benefits, such as:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item sanctuary,
\item legal relief,
\item black market goods,
\item elite followers,
\item forged documents,
\item military backing,
\item rumors and spywork.
\end{itemize}

Using a Perk never requires a roll. Fate has already been paid—it simply comes with Obligation.

\item[\textbf{Demands}]
Terrestrial Patrons always want something back:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item silence,
\item loyalty,
\item a job,
\item a name,
\item a secret.
\end{itemize}

Refusing raises Obligation by 1. Betrayal may have immediate consequences.

\end{description}

\subsection*{When Obligation Fills}
At 6 Obligation, the Patron acts. This is \textbf{not} optional.

Choose one:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item You do a job you cannot refuse.
\item You pay a severe price (legal, social, material).
\item They strike first—reputation, warrants, bounty, blackmail.
\end{itemize}

Reduce Obligation to 3 after the consequence lands.

\subsection*{Cutting Ties}
You may sever a terrestrial tie, but doing so has fallout:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item lose all current perks,
\item gain a new Rival faction,
\item take a Curse, Bounty, or Scandal that follows you.
\end{itemize}

Some patrons never forgive. Others can be bought off.

\subsection*{Redemption or Favor}
If you do something monumental for them—beyond what was asked—reduce Obligation by 2 and gain a permanent Favor:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item title,
\item land,
\item permanent access,
\item unique asset.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Quick Example}
The Black Ledger smuggling syndicate gives sanctuary and illegal gear. Rellan calls on the Ledger for a smuggled border crossing. The GM rules it succeeds automatically, but adds +1 Obligation. Rellan now owes the Ledger. Later, the Ledger demands he silence a witness. If he refuses, Obligation rises again. If Obligation ever reaches 6, the Ledger collects: accounts frozen, bounty posted, or a rival informant sent after him.

\section{Campaign Framing Tools}

Before your first session, use these tools to establish the foundation of your campaign and create a framework for long-term storytelling that will engage your players and provide meaningful direction.

\subsection{The Crown Spread}

The Crown Spread is a powerful campaign-framing technique that uses playing cards to seed the major themes, conflicts, and story elements of your campaign.

\subsubsection{Setup Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In Session 0, shuffle a standard deck of cards and lay out 5--7 cards in a semicircle (the "Crown")
    \item Each card represents a major campaign element:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Position 1 (Root): Underlying tension or theme
        \item Position 2 (Crest): Key faction or influence that will rise
        \item Position 3 (Crown): Climax image or major confrontation
        \item Position 4 (Left Hand): Bond, ally, or relationship anchor
        \item Position 5 (Right Hand): Rival, betrayer, or challenger
        \item Positions 6--7 (Optional): Setting-wide twists or complications
    \end{itemize}
    \item Record the spread openly on a campaign sheet visible to all players
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Interpreting the Spread}

\textbf{Suits:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hearts:} Social/emotional elements, relationships, romance, family
    \item \textbf{Diamonds:} Resources, wealth, trade, material concerns
    \item \textbf{Clubs:} Physical conflict, violence, obstacles, challenges
    \item \textbf{Spades:} Mystical, supernatural, secrets, hidden knowledge
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Ranks:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ace--4:} Subtle influences or early-stage elements
    \item \textbf{5--10:} Moderate forces that will become important
    \item \textbf{Jack--King:} Major players or climactic elements
    \item \textbf{Face Cards:} Named NPCs or significant organizations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Foreshadow Clocks}

Transform each Crown card into a Foreshadow Clock [4] that tracks when that element manifests concretely in play:

\begin{itemize}
    \item When events lean toward that omen, advance the clock
    \item When a Foreshadow Clock fills, the motif manifests in play
    \item Tie Crown elements to your main Campaign Clock for pacing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Campaign Clock}

Establish a master Campaign Clock [8] to track rising stakes across your arc:

\textbf{Advance the Campaign Clock when:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple Story Beats overflow in a session
    \item Travel legs resolve with major complications
    \item Spread omens manifest concretely
    \item Player actions significantly impact the world
\end{itemize}

\textbf{When the Campaign Clock fills:} The Crown confrontation arrives and becomes the campaign climax.

\subsection{Character Integration with the Crown}

Help players connect their characters to the Crown elements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Root Connection:} How does the underlying theme affect your character?
    \item \textbf{Crest Relationship:} Do you support or oppose the rising faction?
    \item \textbf{Crown Stakes:} What do you gain or lose in the final confrontation?
    \item \textbf{Hand Ties:} How do allies/rivals from the spread connect to you?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Session Zero Campaign Setup}

\subsubsection{Preparation Agenda (60--90 minutes)}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Draw the Crown Spread} (15 minutes)
    \item \textbf{Interpret Major Elements} (20 minutes)
    \item \textbf{Establish Player Connections} (20 minutes)
    \item \textbf{Set Initial Clocks} (10 minutes)
    \item \textbf{Review Character Bonds} (5 minutes)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Crown Spread Interpretation Examples}

\textbf{Example Spread:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Root (5 of Hearts):} Family secrets and inherited debts
    \item \textbf{Crest (King of Spades):} A powerful necromancer cult rising to power
    \item \textbf{Crown (Ace of Clubs):} A single decisive battle that will determine regional control
    \item \textbf{Left Hand (Queen of Diamonds):} A wealthy merchant patron who funds the party
    \item \textbf{Right Hand (Jack of Clubs):} A rival adventurer company that opposes the party
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Foreshadow Clocks Created:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Family Secrets [4]: Ties to noble houses and old scandals
    \item Cult Rising [4]: Necromancer influence spreading through the city
    \item Battle Approaches [4]: Military tensions building between factions
    \item Merchant's Favor [4]: Patron's demands becoming more significant
    \item Rival Company [4]: Competitors interfering with party's goals
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Long-Term Campaign Pacing}

Use the Crown Spread elements to pace your campaign across multiple arcs:

\textbf{Early Game (Sessions 1--3):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce Root themes and Left Hand connections
    \item Begin advancing Foreshadow Clocks through player actions
    \item Establish the basic Campaign Clock at 1--2 segments
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mid Game (Sessions 4--8):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Crest elements begin to rise and create pressure
    \item Right Hand rivals become more active and threatening
    \item Campaign Clock advances to 3--5 segments
    \item 2--3 Foreshadow Clocks fill, bringing elements into play
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Late Game (Sessions 9--12):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Crown confrontation becomes imminent
    \item All major elements converge toward climax
    \item Campaign Clock fills, triggering final confrontation
    \item Remaining Foreshadow Clocks resolve in climactic scenes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Campaign Ending and Legacy}

\subsubsection{The Climax}

When the Campaign Clock fills, bring all Crown elements together for the final confrontation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Root theme comes to a head
    \item The Crest faction reaches its moment of power or crisis
    \item Left Hand allies and Right Hand rivals take sides
    \item The Crown confrontation determines the outcome
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Legacy Session}

After the main campaign concludes, hold a legacy session:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Resolve any remaining Foreshadow Clocks as epilogue vignettes
    \item Players mark Legacy Bonds—new relationships for future campaigns
    \item Document major world changes and how player actions shaped them
    \item Award Legacy XP for campaign completion and character growth
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Adapting the Crown Spread}

\textbf{For Shorter Campaigns (3--6 sessions):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use only 3--4 Crown cards
    \item Reduce Foreshadow Clocks to [2--3] segments
    \item Set Campaign Clock to [6] segments
    \item Compress the pacing structure
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For Longer Campaigns (12+ sessions):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use 7--9 Crown cards for more complexity
    \item Create secondary Crown Spreads for major story arcs
    \item Expand Foreshadow Clocks to [6] segments
    \item Plan multiple Campaign Clock cycles
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For Specific Genres:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Political Intrigue:} Emphasize Hearts and Diamonds suits
    \item \textbf{Epic Fantasy:} Emphasize Spades and Clubs suits
    \item \textbf{Mystery/Crime:} Focus on hidden connections between cards
    \item \textbf{War/Battle:} Use multiple Clubs cards for conflict elements
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GM Tips for Campaign Framing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Spread is Not a Railroad:} Foreshadow, don't dictate
    \item \textbf{Reinterpret Cards Liberally:} Symbols matter more than literal events
    \item \textbf{Remind Players of Omens:} Reference Crown elements between sessions
    \item \textbf{Let Players Influence Interpretation:} Ask how they see the cards' meaning
    \item \textbf{Adjust for Player Actions:} Modify Crown elements based on character choices
    \item \textbf{Keep Clocks Visible:} Track Foreshadow and Campaign Clocks openly
\end{itemize}

Remember: The Crown Spread is your campaign's DNA—it provides structure while allowing for organic growth through player agency. Let it guide your storytelling without constraining creativity.
