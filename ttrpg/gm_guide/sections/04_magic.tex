\chapter{Magic and Backlash}\index{magic}\index{backlash}

In \textbf{Fate's Edge}, magic is not a clean or safe art practiced in sterile towers. It is a \textbf{dangerous negotiation with forces beyond mortal comprehension}—a dance on the razor's edge between power and damnation. Every spell is a gamble where power weighs on one side of the scale and consequence balances on the other. As the GM, your role is to make magic \textbf{feel weighty}, \textbf{thematic}, and \textbf{alive with risk}—a force that reshapes reality at a terrible price.

\section*{The Metaphysical Foundation: Eight Elements}\index{Eight Elements}\index{metaphysics}

Magic in Fate's Edge flows from eight fundamental forces that shape existence itself. These elements are not just energy sources—they are \textbf{philosophical principles} that define how reality functions and how magic interacts with it. They represent the core tensions that drive the universe: permanence versus change, creation versus destruction, order versus chaos, life versus death.

\begin{fatebox}[The Eight Elements of Magic]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Element} & \textbf{Domain and Philosophical Nature} \\
\midrule
Earth & Stability, foundation, permanence, material reality, mountains, bones, cities \\
Fire & Transformation, passion, destruction, creation, will, forge, revolution \\
Air & Freedom, thought, communication, wind, breath, ideas, movement, change \\
Water & Flow, emotion, adaptation, tides, blood, intuition, reflection, cycles \\
Fate & Destiny, patterns, inevitability, threads, prophecy, order, consequence \\
Life & Growth, vitality, healing, nature, birth, connection, ecosystem, renewal \\
Luck & Chance, opportunity, randomness, fortune, accident, serendipity, risk \\
Death & Endings, transition, memory, ghosts, sacrifice, silence, completion \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

Each element has its opposite—Earth opposes Air's changeability, Fire counters Water's fluidity, Fate clashes with Luck's randomness, and Life battles Death's finality. This opposition shapes how backlash manifests when magic goes awry. When Earth magic fails, it might cause sudden shifts and instability (Air's domain); when Fire magic backfires, it might create unexpected flows or emotional turbulence (Water's domain).

\section*{Three Faces of Magic}\index{magic paths}

Magic in Fate's Edge is expressed through three interconnected paths. You may specialize in one, or mix them at greater bookkeeping cost. All paths share the same dice engine and SB/Obligation economies, but their flavor and risks differ.

\subsection*{Casting (Freeform)}\index{Casting}\index{freeform magic}

Requires Talent: \textbf{Caster's Gift} (2 XP). Grants access to Weave & Cast using the Eight Elements. Flexible, creative, and risky (Backlash on 1s).

\textbf{Weave \& Cast}: Casters describe the effect in terms of the Eight Elements. The GM sets DV and Effect based on scope.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Weave}: Player builds dice pool and rolls. On success, they stabilize the spell's form.
    \item \textbf{Cast}: A second roll channels the effect into the world.
    \item \textbf{Backlash}: Any 1 rolled may cause narrative backlash related to the Element.
\end{itemize}

Limits: Casters can attempt any effect that can be described, but the larger the scope, the higher the DV. Improvisation is costly; reliable effects require repeated use and narrative justification.

\subsection*{Rites User (Runekeeper)}\index{Rites}\index{Runekeeper}

Requires Patron + Thiasos (Familiar) + Codex (4 XP). Grants access to a Patron's Rites. Structured, powerful, but debt-driven through Obligation.

\textbf{Requirements}: A Patron bond, a Thiasos (Familiar), and a Codex (4 XP) mark a character as a Runekeeper.

\textbf{Invocation}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Action Cost}: Invoking a Rite requires 1 Action.
    \item \textbf{Obligation}: Each Rite used marks Obligation on its clock.
    \item \textbf{Push It}: Once per Rite, you may Push to increase its duration or potency by +1 step at the cost of +1 Obligation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Obligation Clock}: Tracks the Patron's claim. When full, the GM resolves the debt in-fiction. Obligation is reduced through service or downtime actions.

\subsection*{Invoker (Symbol Path)}\index{Invoker}\index{symbol magic}

Requires one or more Patron's Symbols (4 XP each). Grants access to that Patron's Rites via rituals. Safe but slow; can Crack the Seal to cast instantly at steep Obligation cost.

\begin{fatebox}[Invoker Path Features]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Description and Limitations} \\
\midrule
Patron's Symbol & Minor Asset, 4 XP each. Each Symbol grants ritual access to one Patron's Rites. \\
Ritual Invocation & Takes \(\text{DV} + 1\) rounds. Always marks +1 Obligation. \\
Crack the Seal & Instant cast by setting the Symbol to \textsc{Compromised} and marking +2 Obligation (+3 if High-Power). \\
No Push & Invoker Rites cannot use \emph{Push It} benefits. \\
Symbol Display & The Symbol must be visible throughout the invocation. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\textbf{Example:} Brother Theron carries the Symbol of the Stone-Warden. Faced with a collapsing tunnel, he performs a full ritual to reinforce the stone (\(\text{DV} + 1\) rounds, +1 Obligation). When ambushed moments later, he \textbf{Cracks the Seal} for instant protection—the Symbol grows hot and fractures, marking +2 Obligation as stone shields erupt around him.

\section*{Summoning: Binding Outsider Forces}\index{Summoning}\index{Pact-Whisperer}

Summoning is a way to call and bind Outsiders for temporary aid. This path requires the \textbf{Pact-Whisperer} talent (2 XP).

\begin{fatebox}[Summoning Core Mechanics]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Mechanic} & \textbf{Description and Requirements} \\
\midrule
Call & 1 Action to manifest spirit at Near range; choose Spirit Template \\
Bind & Spend 1 Boon or mark 1 Fatigue to establish initial control \\
Leash & Set Leash = Cap + 2 segments (Cap is the Outsider's tier) \\
Tick Leash & Whenever spirit takes harm, you command against its nature, you split focus, rival contests it, it moves Close to Far quickly, or it crosses a [WARD] \\
Departure & When the Leash fills, the spirit acts to its nature once, then departs \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

Summoning follows a specific procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Call} (1 action): A spirit manifests at Near range. Choose a Spirit Template.
    \item \textbf{Bind}: Choose one: spend 1 Boon or mark 1 Fatigue.
    \item \textbf{Leash}: Set Leash = Cap + 2 segments.
    \item \textbf{Command}: Issue orders each round; inappropriate commands tick Leash.
    \item \textbf{Maintain}: Keep focus on the spirit or risk Leash ticks.
    \item \textbf{Departure}: When Leash fills, spirit acts to nature once then departs.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Limits}: Only one active summoned spirit at a time (unless a Talent says otherwise). All summons depart at Downtime unless explicitly sustained.

\textbf{Example}: Kestra calls forth a Cap 3 fire elemental to aid in battle. She spends 1 Boon to Bind it. The elemental's Leash is 5 segments (3+2). When it takes Harm 1 from enemy attacks, the GM ticks the Leash. Later, when Kestra splits her focus to attack while the elemental acts, another tick is marked. With careful management, the elemental proves a powerful ally—but its volatile nature means one misstep could turn it against the party.

\section*{Magical Arts and Specialization}\index{Magical Arts}

A character's Art represents their personal approach to magic—the techniques, tools, and philosophies that define their craft. When a character gains magical capability, they define their Art with specific parameters.

\begin{fatebox}[Defining Your Magical Art]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Description and Examples} \\
\midrule
Gesture \& Medium & Ink sigils, sung names, lantern-light, bone charms, legal contracts, salt-threads \\
Elemental Alignment & Choose 2 primary Elements the Art typically engages with (Fire+Earth, Air+Water, etc.) \\
Thematic Focus & Destruction, protection, revelation, transformation, communication, healing \\
Cultural Roots & High Elf crystal-song, Ykrul blood-runes, Aeler spirit-whispers, Human alchemy \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\subsection*{Art in Play}\index{Magical Arts!in play}

The fictional positioning of a character's Art matters significantly:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spotlight Bump (1/scene)}: If the Art is clearly honored in fiction (right tools, time, setting), gain +1 die on the Cast roll
    \item \textbf{Off-Style Strain}: If forced to work against the Art's nature (no tools, hostile environment), suffer worse Position or accept extra Backlash
    \item \textbf{Art-Based Backlash}: Consequences should reflect the Art's themes and elements
\end{itemize}

\section*{Tags: The Language of Magical Effects}\index{Tags}\index{magical effects}

Tags provide a common language for describing magical effects and their limitations. They only function when printed on a Talent, Ability, or Spell result.

\begin{fatebox}[Common Magical Tags and Effects]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Tag} & \textbf{Effect and Usage Guidelines} \\
\midrule
[DISPEL] & End an ongoing magical effect/construct. DV by fiction. \\
[COUNTER] & Interrupt a cast/rite in progress. DV by fiction. \\
[BARRIER] & Create cover/obstruction. DV by fiction. \\
[SEAL]/[UNSEAL] & Lock or unlock a container/door/portal. DV by fiction. \\
[VEIL] & Obscure a person/thing/zone. DV by fiction. \\
[REVEAL] & Expose illusions, disguises, hidden clauses. DV by fiction. \\
[MARK] & Tag a target for tracking or leverage. DV by fiction. \\
[CURSE] & Inflict a sticky hindrance with a clear release. DV by fiction. \\
[CLEANSE] & Remove/suppress a condition. DV by fiction. \\
[FORTIFY] & Harden against a vector. DV by fiction. \\
[COMMAND] & Issue a clear order to a sapient target. DV by fiction. \\
[OATH] & Bind parties to terms; breaking has teeth. DV by fiction. \\
[SANCTIFY] & Consecrate a zone to a code/patron. DV by fiction. \\
[PASSAGE] & Declare a route as permitted/easy. DV by fiction. \\
[TRANSPORT] & Move a target across an obstacle. DV by fiction. \\
[CONJURE] & Create a useful object/cover/hazard. DV by fiction. \\
[WARD] & Challenge Outsiders crossing a warded edge/zone. DV = target Cap. \\
[BANISH] & Drive a visible Outsider toward departure. DV = target Cap. \\
[UNWARD] & Unmake/suppress a [WARD]. DV by fiction. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

Tags work within consistent parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DV by Fiction}: Potency, preparation, and opposition set difficulty
    \item \textbf{Duration}: Typically "Scene" unless specified otherwise
    \item \textbf{Stacking}: No same-source stacking; identical tags use strongest instance
\end{itemize}

\section*{Backlash: The Price of Power}\index{Backlash}

Backlash represents magic escaping control—the inevitable consequence of wielding forces beyond mortal comprehension. It's never arbitrary; backlash always reflects the elements involved and their philosophical oppositions.

\subsection*{Backlash Triggers and Severity}

Backlash occurs when magic goes awry:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primary Trigger}: Partial or Miss on either the Weave or Cast roll
    \item \textbf{Secondary Trigger}: Hit showing two or more 1s (minor backlash rides success)
    \item \textbf{SB Integration}: Backlash does not generate extra SB—it's how GM spends SB from rolled 1s
\end{itemize}

Backlash colors the cost of magic and is always expressed through fiction first.

\begin{fatebox}[Backlash Menu]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Backlash Type} & \textbf{Effect} \\
\midrule
Position Shift & Worsen Position by 1 step for current or next action \\
Fleeting Harm/Condition & Sear, vertigo, chill that matters for this scene \\
Exposure/Noise & Draws notice or complicates stealth \\
Resource Drain & Time, focus, or component damaged \\
Collateral Spark & Threatens ally or fragile thing nearby \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\subsection*{Elemental Backlash Coloring}\index{Backlash!elemental}

On Partial/Miss (or double-1s on a Hit), color consequences by Element:

\begin{fatebox}[Elemental Backlash Coloring]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Element Pair} & \textbf{Minor Backlash} \\
\midrule
Earth / Fate & Slips, binds, encumbrance \\
Fire / Life & Smoke, sparks, heat \\
Air / Luck & Scatter, misheard words \\
Water / Dreams & Slippery tide, slow gear \\
Fate / Earth & Probability resists \\
Life / Fire & Growth surge, vines tether \\
Luck / Air & Odds flip \\
Death / Water & Whispers, chill \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

Backlash should always feel thematic to the magic employed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fire Magic}: Burns, flares, smoke, heat exhaustion, uncontrolled fires
    \item \textbf{Water Magic}: Flooding, slick surfaces, damp-related rot, emotional turbulence
    \item \textbf{Earth Magic}: Tremors, collapsing structures, immobilization, heavy burdens
    \item \textbf{Air Magic}: Unexpected winds, carried sounds, vertigo, scattered plans
    \item \textbf{Fate Magic}: Closed options, inevitable consequences, prophetic nightmares
    \item \textbf{Luck Magic}: Allied misfortunes, fragile successes, random complications
    \item \textbf{Life Magic}: Overgrowth, sympathetic pain, unnatural hunger, fertility curses
    \item \textbf{Death Magic}: Ghostly echoes, premature aging, silence, memory loss
\end{itemize}

\section*{Ritual Casting: Collective Magic}\index{ritual casting}

Some workings require multiple casters pooling their strength. Rituals allow for greater effects but multiply risks.

\subsection*{Ritual Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Declaration}: Primary caster states intent and gathers participants
    \item \textbf{Channel Together}: All participants contribute (Scene-long action)
    \item \textbf{Weave}: Primary caster shapes combined Potential (Scene-long action)  
    \item \textbf{Backlash}: Consequences affect all participants based on their contribution
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Ritual Mechanics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Helper Cap}: Primary caster can draw on ceil(Arcana/2) helpers (max 3)
    \item \textbf{Skill Flexibility}: Helpers may use different relevant skills if fictionally distinct
    \item \textbf{Risk Distribution}: SB from Channel affects individual rollers; SB from Weave affects primary caster
\end{itemize}

\section*{Magic in Combat}\index{magic combat}

Spellcasting in combat follows the same principles but with heightened stakes and immediate consequences.

\subsection*{Combat Casting Considerations}

\begin{fatebox}[Magic in Combat: Position and Effect]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Position} & \textbf{Effect on Magical Actions} \\
\midrule
Controlled & +1 die to Channel; reduced Backlash risk; can maintain subtle effects \\
Risky & Standard casting conditions; typical risk/reward balance \\
Desperate & -1 die to Channel; increased Backlash severity; may attract unwanted attention \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\subsection*{Tactical Magic Applications}

Magic can reshape combat dynamics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Position Warfare}: Spells that create cover, elevate positions, or restrict movement
    \item \textbf{Morale Effects}: Magic that inspires allies or terrifies enemies
    \item \textbf{Environmental Control}: Creating hazards, altering terrain, manipulating weather
    \item \textbf{Resource Denial}: Destroying enemy equipment, exhausting their supplies
\end{itemize}

\section*{Prestige Magical Abilities}\index{Prestige Abilities!magical}

High-level magical talents represent profound mastery or unique cultural inheritances.

\begin{fatebox}[Example Prestige Magical Abilities]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Ability} & \textbf{Description and Requirements} \\
\midrule
Echo-Walker's Step & Observe perfect echo of past event (1/arc); GM banks +2 SB; reveals hidden truths (Req: Wits 5, Arcana 4) \\
Warglord & Unify scattered warbands into host for season; track Logistics and Grudge clocks (Req: Body 5, Command 3) \\
Spirit-Shield & Erase up to 3 SB from ally's roll (1/session); caster takes Fatigue +1 and GM banks +1 SB (Req: Spirit 4, Insight 3) \\
Elemental Mastery & Choose one Element; gain +2 dice when using it, but backlash from opposite element is doubled \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\section*{Design Philosophy: Magic as Narrative Engine}\index{design intent!magic}

Magic in Fate's Edge serves specific design goals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk-Reward Balance}: Every magical act should feel consequential
    \item \textbf{Thematic Consistency}: Magic should reflect the world's metaphysics
    \item \textbf{Narrative Primacy}: Mechanics exist to serve interesting stories
    \item \textbf{Player Agency}: Magic should offer creative solutions, not bypass challenges
    \item \textbf{World Reactivity}: The setting should respond meaningfully to magical use
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{GM Guidance: Making Magic Feel Magical}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Describe the Unseen}: When magic is cast, describe how the world reacts—air crackles, shadows deepen, spirits stir
    \item \textbf{Follow the Consequences}: Magical actions should have lasting effects on the narrative
    \item \textbf{Respect the Elements}: Backlash should feel philosophically appropriate
    \item \textbf{Highlight the Cost}: Make players feel the weight of their magical choices
    \item \textbf{Encourage Creativity}: Reward inventive uses of magic that enhance the story
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Remember}: In Fate's Edge, magic is never a shortcut. It's a pathway filled with wonders and dangers—a tool that changes both the world and the wielder. The dice are not your enemy; they're your collaborator in crafting a world where \textbf{true power always demands an equal price}.
