\chapter{Magic and Backlash}\index{magic}\index{backlash}

In \textbf{Fate's Edge}, magic is not a clean or safe art practiced in sterile towers. It is a \textbf{dangerous negotiation with forces beyond mortal comprehension}—a dance on the razor's edge between power and damnation. Every spell is a gamble where power weighs on one side of the scale and consequence balances on the other. As the GM, your role is to make magic \textbf{feel weighty}, \textbf{thematic}, and \textbf{alive with risk}—a force that reshapes reality at a terrible price.

\section*{The Metaphysical Foundation: Eight Elements}\index{Eight Elements}\index{metaphysics}

Magic in Fate's Edge flows from eight fundamental forces that shape existence itself. These elements are not just energy sources—they are \textbf{philosophical principles} that define how reality functions and how magic interacts with it. They represent the core tensions that drive the universe: permanence versus change, creation versus destruction, order versus chaos, life versus death.

\begin{fatebox}[The Eight Elements of Magic]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Element} & \textbf{Domain and Philosophical Nature} \\
\midrule
Earth & Stability, foundation, permanence, material reality, mountains, bones, cities \\
Fire & Transformation, passion, destruction, creation, will, forge, revolution \\
Air & Freedom, thought, communication, wind, breath, ideas, movement, change \\
Water & Flow, emotion, adaptation, tides, blood, intuition, reflection, cycles \\
Fate & Destiny, patterns, inevitability, threads, prophecy, order, consequence \\
Life & Growth, vitality, healing, nature, birth, connection, ecosystem, renewal \\
Luck & Chance, opportunity, randomness, fortune, accident, serendipity, risk \\
Death & Endings, transition, memory, ghosts, sacrifice, silence, completion \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

Each element has its opposite—Earth opposes Air's changeability, Fire counters Water's fluidity, Fate clashes with Luck's randomness, and Life battles Death's finality. This opposition shapes how backlash manifests when magic goes awry. When Earth magic fails, it might cause sudden shifts and instability (Air's domain); when Fire magic backfires, it might create unexpected flows or emotional turbulence (Water's domain).

\section*{Three Faces of Magic}\index{magic paths}

Magic in Fate's Edge is expressed through three interconnected paths. You may specialize in one, or mix them at greater bookkeeping cost. All paths share the same dice engine and SB/Obligation economies, but their flavor and risks differ.

\subsection*{Casting (Freeform)}\index{Casting}\index{freeform magic}

Requires Talent: \textbf{Caster's Gift} (2 XP). Grants access to Weave & Cast using the Eight Elements. Flexible, creative, and risky (Backlash on 1s).

\textbf{Weave \& Cast}: Casters describe the effect in terms of the Eight Elements. The GM sets DV and Effect based on scope.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Weave}: Player builds dice pool and rolls. On success, they stabilize the spell's form.
    \item \textbf{Cast}: A second roll channels the effect into the world.
    \item \textbf{Backlash}: Any 1 rolled may cause narrative backlash related to the Element.
\end{itemize}

Limits: Casters can attempt any effect that can be described, but the larger the scope, the higher the DV. Improvisation is costly; reliable effects require repeated use and narrative justification.

\subsection*{Rites User (Runekeeper)}\index{Rites}\index{Runekeeper}

Requires Patron + Thiasos (Familiar) + Codex (4 XP). Grants access to a Patron's Rites. Structured, powerful, but debt-driven through Obligation.

\textbf{Requirements}: A Patron bond, a Thiasos (Familiar), and a Codex (4 XP) mark a character as a Runekeeper.

\textbf{Invocation}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Action Cost}: Invoking a Rite requires 1 Action.
    \item \textbf{Obligation}: Each Rite used marks Obligation on its clock.
    \item \textbf{Push It}: Once per Rite, you may Push to increase its duration or potency by +1 step at the cost of +1 Obligation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Obligation Clock}: Tracks the Patron's claim. When full, the GM resolves the debt in-fiction. Obligation is reduced through service or downtime actions.

\subsection*{Invoker (Ritualist's Path)}\index{Invoker}\index{Ritualist}\index{Grimoire}

Requires the \textbf{Invoker's Grimoire} talent (6 XP) and study of specific rites. Grants deep knowledge of ritual magic and the ability to perform Rites from multiple Patrons. Symbols are potent tools that enhance this knowledge.

\begin{fatebox}[Invoker Path Features]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Description and Limitations} \\
\midrule
Invoker's Grimoire & Major Talent, 6 XP. Grants knowledge of Ritual Magic theory and access to perform a limited number of Rites. \\
Ritual Repertoire & Start with knowledge of \textbf{2} Low or Standard Rites from any Patrons you research. Learn new Rites through Downtime study (see below). \\
Ritual Invocation & Takes \(\text{DV}\) rounds (default 2--3 rounds). Requires specific components/materials. \\
Base Cost & Mark \textbf{+1 Obligation} when you successfully resolve any known Rite (Low or Standard). \textit{(High-Power/High Rites are normally unavailable; if the Keeper permits, treat their \emph{base} Obligation as +2.)}\\
Symbol Enhancement & Possessing the correct Patron's Symbol for a Rite you are casting reduces its \textbf{DV by 1} and its \textbf{Obligation cost by 1} (minimum 0). Only one Symbol may apply to a given Rite. \\
\textbf{No Symbol (Explicit Penalties)} & You may attempt the Rite without the Patron's Symbol, but suffer: \textbf{+1 DV}, \textbf{+1 Obligation} (in addition to Base), and \textbf{+1 round} casting time. On \emph{Partial/Failure}, generate \textbf{+1 extra SB}. \\
Symbol Display & The Symbol must be visible/active throughout the ritual. If it is concealed, disrupted, or removed mid-cast: immediately \textbf{+1 DV}; on Failure, apply \emph{Backlash} (see below). \\
Crack the Seal & Desperate technique. Instantly cast any known Rite by setting the relevant Symbol to \textsc{Compromised}. Mark \textbf{+2 Obligation} (\textbf{+3} for High-Power Rites). Does not reduce Base Obligation below 0. \\
Optional Push & Invokers may \emph{Push} a Rite: choose one (\(+2\) dice \emph{or} +1 Effect \emph{or} resolve one round faster). Always mark \textbf{+1 Obligation} \emph{and} generate \textbf{1 SB}, in addition to other costs. \\
Cross-Resonance & If you cast Rites from \emph{different Patrons} in the same scene, each Patron after the first adds \textbf{+1 DV} to that Rite. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\paragraph{Symbol States \& Repair}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textsc{Compromised:} A Symbol set to \textsc{Compromised} (e.g., via \emph{Crack the Seal}) provides \emph{no} DV/Obligation reduction until repaired. Casting with a \textsc{Compromised} Symbol imposes \(-1\) die on the Casting Test.
  \item \textsc{Shattered:} If you \emph{Crack the Seal} again while the Symbol is \textsc{Compromised}, it becomes \textsc{Shattered} and cannot be used until replaced (Asset lost).
  \item \textbf{Repair (Downtime):} 1 day of focused work and a \emph{Craft or Lore + Tinker} test vs.\ DV~3. Success: clear \textsc{Compromised}. Failure: no progress. Alternatively, spend \textbf{1 XP} to auto-repair.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Backlash \& Failure (Explicit)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Success:} Rite resolves; apply Base/added Obligation and any SB from Push or No-Symbol clauses.
  \item \textbf{Partial:} Effect \(-1\) step \emph{or} shortened duration; mark \textbf{Fatigue 1}. If cast \emph{without} a Symbol, Keeper gains \textbf{+1 SB} (in addition to normal SB generation).
  \item \textbf{Failure:} No effect; mark \textbf{Fatigue 1}; Keeper gains \textbf{+1 SB}. Then test \emph{Spirit + Resolve} vs.\ DV~3:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item On Fail: suffer \textbf{Harm 1 (Shock)} or start \textbf{Backlash Static [4]} (Keeper's choice).
      \item If the Symbol was disrupted/hidden mid-cast \emph{or} you \emph{Cracked the Seal}: upgrade to \textbf{Harm 2 (Shock)}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Interrupted:} Harm, Silence, or disruption before resolution counts as \emph{Failure}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} Magus Vex, bearing the \textbf{Invoker's Grimoire}, has studied the rites of Raéyn and the Sealed Gate. He knows Raéyn's \emph{Whispering Currents} (Low) and the Sealed Gate's \emph{Circle of Denial} (Standard). Faced with a collapsing tunnel, he attempts the Sealed Gate's ritual. It's a Standard Rite, so \textbf{DV 3}, taking \textbf{3 rounds}, and costs \textbf{+1 Obligation}. He has the Sealed Gate's Symbol, reducing the DV to \textbf{2} and the Obligation cost to \textbf{0}. When ambushed, he needs quick protection. He \textbf{Cracks the Seal} on the \emph{Circle of Denial}. The Symbol becomes \textsc{Compromised}, the Rite is instant, and he marks \textbf{+2 Obligation}. Later, needing to bind a particularly strong foe, he \textbf{Pushes} the Rite, marking an additional \textbf{+1 Obligation} and generating \textbf{1 SB}; the barrier strengthens. If he tried a Raéyn Rite afterwards in the same scene, \emph{Cross-Resonance} would add \textbf{+1 DV} to that casting.

\subsubsection*{Learning New Rites}
An Invoker can expand their \textbf{Ritual Repertoire} through dedicated study during \textbf{Downtime}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cost:} 1 week of Downtime + 2 XP.
    \item \textbf{Requirement:} Access to texts, a teacher, or direct observation of the Rite being performed by another adept.
    \item \textbf{Test:} \emph{Lore + Investigation} (or a relevant skill) vs.\ DV~3--5 (based on Rite rarity/complexity).
    \item \textbf{Success:} Add the Rite to your Ritual Repertoire.
    \item \textbf{Failure:} Cannot learn this specific Rite for a significant time (GM discretion). The Keeper may set a relevant Complication (e.g., \emph{Forbidden Knowledge Pursued}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Symbols as Assets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A Patron's Symbol is a \textbf{Minor Asset (4 XP)} whose primary value is as a \textbf{ritual focus/component}.
    \item You \emph{can} attempt any ritual \textbf{without} the Symbol, but you incur these \textbf{No Symbol} penalties: \textbf{+1 DV} \emph{(and therefore +1 round to cast, since casting time = DV rounds)}, \textbf{+1 Obligation} \emph{(in addition to Base)}, and on \emph{Partial/Failure} the Keeper gains \textbf{+1 extra SB}.    \item Symbols can be \textbf{maintained/upgraded} like other Assets. Example upgrades: \emph{Hardened} (ignore the first application of \textsc{Compromised} per session), \emph{Bright} (treat as \emph{visible} for Symbol Display while concealed on your person).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Borrowed Grace}
\label{talent:borrowed-grace}
\index{Talents!Invoker}\index{Imbuement!Lesser}

\textbf{Type:} Invoker Talent — \textit{Lesser Imbuement}

\subsubsection*{Use}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cost:} \textbf{1 Boon}, \textbf{1 action}.
  \item \textbf{Effect (pick one on use):} \textbf{+1 Melee} \emph{or} \textbf{+1 Thematic} (your table's signature/thematic Skill).
  \item \textbf{Duration:} \textit{Single action/attack} (instantaneous boost only).
  \item \textbf{Requirement:} Wield/display the relevant Patron's \textbf{Symbol}.
  \item \textbf{Obligation:} Immediately mark \textbf{+1 Obligation} to that Patron (see \S\ref{sec:obligation}).
  \item \textbf{Limits:} Cannot be extended, stacked, or \emph{Pushed} for duration. Using \emph{Borrowed Grace} while the Symbol is \textsc{Compromised} lowers your \textbf{Position} by one step \emph{(or imposes \(-1\) die if already \textbf{Desperate})}.)
\end{itemize}

\section{Obligation Capacity}

A character’s \textbf{Obligation Capacity} equals Spirit + Presence.
Track total Obligation segments across all Patrons (or Symbols, for Invokers).

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Exceeding Capacity:} For each segment above Capacity, mark 1 Fatigue. The character cannot Invoke Rites or perform rituals until Obligation is reduced below Capacity.
  \item \textbf{Overload (≥ 2x Capacity):} Clear all Fatigue, take +1 Harm, and suffer immediate Patron intrusion (Claim, demand, or narrative cost). Downtime cannot reduce Obligation until Harm is addressed.
  \item \textbf{Resolution:} Reduce Obligation through Downtime service, Patron tasks, ritual cleansing, or story resolution.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} Spirit~2 + Presence~3 = Capacity 5.
6 segments → Fatigue~1.
7 segments → Fatigue~2.
10 segments → Harm~1.
11 segments → Harm~2.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Universal Push It Costs}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Cost Component} & \textbf{Effect} \\
\hline
+1 SB & Escalate effect immediately \\
+1 Fatigue & Immediate physical/mental strain \\
+1 Corruption Clock Segment & Long-term Patron influence (unless otherwise specified) \\
GM spends 1 SB & Thematic complication (unless otherwise specified) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note: Some talents, Rites, or magical paths may specify alternative corruption costs or additional consequences for Push It actions. When explicitly stated, those specific rules override the universal costs.

\paragraph{Clearing Corruption}
Corruption may be reduced through \textit{purging rituals}, such as exorcisms, sacred songs, or rites of contrition. 
These require a test (typically \textbf{Lore + Spirit}) against a DV equal to the character’s current corruption level.  
On success, reduce corruption by 1. On failure, the corruption manifests violently, imposing a temporary Condition or advancing its narrative expression.  

Optional: A \textbf{Story Beat} may also be spent to attempt such a ritual, representing the personal cost of atonement. Patrons may demand specific acts of service, sacrifice, or obligation as part of the purging process.
\section*{Summoning: Binding Outsider Forces}\index{Summoning}\index{Pact-Whisperer}

%----------------------------------------
\section{Summoning (Pact-Whisperer) — GM Mechanics}
\label{subsec:summoning-gm}

\begin{fatebox}[Core]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Step} & \textbf{Rule (GM-Facing)} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Access} & Requires \textbf{Pact-Whisperer} (2 XP). Talents gate capacity: \textbf{Lesser Pactwright} (Cap~1), \textbf{Greater Pactwright} (Cap~3). With both, one of each may be maintained. \\
\textbf{Call} & \emph{1 Action}. Manifest at \textit{Near}. Choose a fitting Spirit Template (scene/Patron aligned). \\
\textbf{Bind} & Pay 1 Boon \emph{or} mark 1 Fatigue. \\
\textbf{Leash Capacity} & Set \(\textbf{Leash} = \textit{Cap} + \textit{Spirit}\) \emph{segments}. (Cap~1 = Lesser, Cap~3 = Greater.) \\
\textbf{Tick Triggers} & Tick on: spirit takes Harm; command vs.\ nature; summoner splits focus; rival contests; rapid \textit{Close}\(\rightarrow\)\textit{Far} reposition; crossing a \texttt{[WARD]} (test \(\mathrm{DV}=\mathrm{Cap}\)). \\
\textbf{Act/Order} & A meaningful new order uses the summoner's Action; \emph{Quick Commands} (attack nearest, hold doorway, relocate within \textit{Near}, fetch and return) do not. \\
\textbf{Departure} & When Leash fills, spirit acts to its nature once, then departs (or turns hostile at GM discretion). \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\paragraph*{Spirit Bond (Light Progress).}
Track a \textbf{Spirit Bond Clock [4]} per recurring spirit type. Mark on shared victories, good handling, or mutual aid. At 2: +1 die to communicate. At 4: on natural departure, +1 Boon and spirit becomes \textbf{Favored} (its Leash $-1$). \textit{Near-Miss:} once/session per type, mark +1 on a meaningful failed Call/Bind.

\paragraph*{Specializations (Pick When Relevant).}
Combat Specialist (+1 Harm melee; ignore first Harm on attacks) \quad
Scout Form (stealth/range; carry up to Cap~1: 2\,kg, Cap~3: 10\,kg; dragging $\le 3\times$; overburden = tick) \quad
Utility Spirit (simple tasks) \quad
Shield Guardian (interpose; convert Harm\(\rightarrow\)Fatigue).

\paragraph*{Economy \& Limits.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Boon Finesse:} Once/round, spend 1 Boon to clear 1 tick (before fill).
  \item \textbf{Order of Action:} Spirit acts immediately after summoner.
  \item \textbf{Concurrency:} One active spirit unless a Talent states otherwise; excess costs 1 Fatigue per extra Cap point.
  \item \textbf{End-State:} All summons end at Downtime unless sustained by Rite/Asset.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{GM Reminders (No New Clocks).}
Use only the \textbf{Leash} and optional \textbf{Spirit Bond} clocks. \emph{Quick Commands} should be crisp rulings; tick when the player overreaches the spirit's nature or fiction.

%----------------------------------------
\section{Cantor's Path (Songs) — GM Mechanics}
\label{talent:cantors-path-gm}

\begin{fatebox}[Core]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Element} & \textbf{Rule (GM-Facing)} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Access} & Talent: \textbf{Cantor's Path} (8 XP). Prereqs: Lore~1+, Performance~2+, Presence~2+. \\
\textbf{Scope} & \textbf{Low Rites as Songs} only (counts as knowing for performance use). \\
\textbf{Cast Test} & \emph{Lore + Performance vs.\ DV} (typical DV~2–3). \\
\textbf{Timing} & Start with 1 Action; resolves at \emph{start of next turn} unless \emph{Pushed}. \\
\textbf{Cost} & Pay listed materials. \emph{No Obligation} on success. \\
\textbf{Visibility} & Songs are noticeable; on Failure or Push, assume observers clock it. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\paragraph*{Corruption (Light).}
Track a \textbf{Corruption Clock} with \(\text{segments}=\) \textbf{Body}. Mark when: \emph{Push}, perform a \emph{Resonant Rite}, or the Keeper spends an SB tied to psionic/occult activity.
On fill: apply the last-Patron \textbf{benefit \& drawback} (and echo to followers/retainers); then reset.

\paragraph*{Resonant Rites.}
Designated Low Rites may \emph{optionally} mark +1 Corruption on success for added weight. Player chooses to resonate or not.

\paragraph*{Results.}
\textbf{Success:} Rite as written. \quad
\textbf{Partial:} $-1$ step or shorter duration; mark Fatigue~1. \quad
\textbf{Failure/Interrupted:} No effect; mark Fatigue~1; GM gains +1 SB (Hearts).

\paragraph*{Push.}
Resolve now; mark Fatigue~1; mark +1 Corruption; trigger a GM \textbf{Story Beat} (Patron/Road/social fallout).

\paragraph*{Song Synergy (Tight Rulings).}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Compatible Songs} = same Patron \emph{or} clearly similar thematic purpose.
  \item \textbf{Harmony:} Two compatible Songs: +1 Effect to both.
  \item \textbf{Counterpoint:} Opposed Songs may cancel a drawback (GM adjudicates).
  \item \textbf{Chorus:} Multiple singers amplify (+1 Effect per participant), but cap coordinated \emph{Song Weaver} style combos at \textbf{3 participants}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Repertoire (Optional, Light).}
Single \textbf{Repertoire Clock [6]} for breadth: 2~seg = base DV $-1$ (min 2); 4~seg = +1 die to Song rolls; 6~seg = one \emph{temporary} Standard Rite as Song (practice-dependent).

\paragraph*{High Cantor (Prestige, Fast Ruling).}
Standard Rites as \textbf{High Cant}: instant; +1 die to primary effect; mark +1 Corruption. Recognizably flashy; repeated uses in a scene add +1 DV to subsequent \emph{Resolve} saves (fear/charm/social pressure).

\paragraph*{Bookkeeping Cap.}
At the table, track \emph{only}: \textbf{Corruption Clock} and (optionally) the single \textbf{Repertoire Clock}. Do not add per-Song timers; use outcomes and Push to pace.

\subsection*{Inspire Chorus}
\label{subsec:inspire-chorus}

While \emph{actively singing a Song} (from the action to begin until it resolves, or while a \emph{Lingering Verse} persists), the Cantor may \textbf{invoke Inspire Chorus}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Effect:} All \textbf{allies within Near} (including the Cantor) \textbf{shift Position +1} for \textbf{one exchange} (e.g., Desperate$\to$Risky, Risky$\to$Controlled). Position cannot exceed \textbf{Controlled}. This does not stack with other Position-shift auras; use the best single shift.
  \item \textbf{Use:} \textbf{Once per scene} at no cost. \textbf{Additional uses in the same scene} are allowed, but each \textbf{immediately marks +1 segment on the Cantor's Corruption Clock}.
  \item \textbf{Requirements:} The performance must be perceptible to recipients (line of hearing; \textit{Silence} or similar effects suppress it).
  \item \textbf{Timing:} Declare on starting the Song or at any time before it resolves; the shift lasts until the start of the Cantor's next turn.
  \item \textbf{Notes:} Using \emph{Inspire Chorus} does not change Song DV, Action cost, or outcomes. It respects \emph{Bookkeeping Light}: no new clocks are created.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Magical Arts and Specialization}\index{Magical Arts}

A character's Art represents their personal approach to magic—the techniques, tools, and philosophies that define their craft. When a character gains magical capability, they define their Art with specific parameters.

\begin{fatebox}[Defining Your Magical Art]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Description and Examples} \\
\midrule
Gesture \& Medium & Ink sigils, sung names, lantern-light, bone charms, legal contracts, salt-threads \\
Elemental Alignment & Choose 2 primary Elements the Art typically engages with (Fire+Earth, Air+Water, etc.) \\
Thematic Focus & Destruction, protection, revelation, transformation, communication, healing \\
Cultural Roots & High Elf crystal-song, Ykrul blood-runes, Aeler spirit-whispers, Human alchemy \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\subsection*{Art in Play}\index{Magical Arts!in play}

The fictional positioning of a character's Art matters significantly:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spotlight Bump (1/scene)}: If the Art is clearly honored in fiction (right tools, time, setting), gain +1 die on the Cast roll
    \item \textbf{Off-Style Strain}: If forced to work against the Art's nature (no tools, hostile environment), suffer worse Position or accept extra Backlash
    \item \textbf{Art-Based Backlash}: Consequences should reflect the Art's themes and elements
\end{itemize}

\section*{Tags: The Language of Magical Effects}\index{Tags}\index{magical effects}

Tags provide a common language for describing magical effects and their limitations. They only function when printed on a Talent, Ability, or Spell result.

\begin{fatebox}[Common Magical Tags and Effects]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Tag} & \textbf{Effect and Usage Guidelines} \\
\midrule
[DISPEL] & End an ongoing magical effect/construct. DV by fiction. \\
[COUNTER] & Interrupt a cast/rite in progress. DV by fiction. \\
[BARRIER] & Create cover/obstruction. DV by fiction. \\
[SEAL]/[UNSEAL] & Lock or unlock a container/door/portal. DV by fiction. \\
[VEIL] & Obscure a person/thing/zone. DV by fiction. \\
[REVEAL] & Expose illusions, disguises, hidden clauses. DV by fiction. \\
[MARK] & Tag a target for tracking or leverage. DV by fiction. \\
[CURSE] & Inflict a sticky hindrance with a clear release. DV by fiction. \\
[CLEANSE] & Remove/suppress a condition. DV by fiction. \\
[FORTIFY] & Harden against a vector. DV by fiction. \\
[COMMAND] & Issue a clear order to a sapient target. DV by fiction. \\
[OATH] & Bind parties to terms; breaking has teeth. DV by fiction. \\
[SANCTIFY] & Consecrate a zone to a code/patron. DV by fiction. \\
[PASSAGE] & Declare a route as permitted/easy. DV by fiction. \\
[TRANSPORT] & Move a target across an obstacle. DV by fiction. \\
[CONJURE] & Create a useful object/cover/hazard. DV by fiction. \\
[WARD] & Challenge Outsiders crossing a warded edge/zone. DV = target Cap. \\
[BANISH] & Drive a visible Outsider toward departure. DV = target Cap. \\
[UNWARD] & Unmake/suppress a [WARD]. DV by fiction. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

Tags work within consistent parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DV by Fiction}: Potency, preparation, and opposition set difficulty
    \item \textbf{Duration}: Typically "Scene" unless specified otherwise
    \item \textbf{Stacking}: No same-source stacking; identical tags use strongest instance
\end{itemize}

\section*{Backlash: The Price of Power}\index{Backlash}

Backlash represents magic escaping control—the inevitable consequence of wielding forces beyond mortal comprehension. It's never arbitrary; backlash always reflects the elements involved and their philosophical oppositions.

\subsection*{Backlash Triggers and Severity}

Backlash occurs when magic goes awry:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primary Trigger}: Partial or Miss on either the Weave or Cast roll
    \item \textbf{Secondary Trigger}: Hit showing two or more 1s (minor backlash rides success)
    \item \textbf{SB Integration}: Backlash does not generate extra SB—it's how GM spends SB from rolled 1s
\end{itemize}

Backlash colors the cost of magic and is always expressed through fiction first.

\begin{fatebox}[Backlash Menu]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Backlash Type} & \textbf{Effect} \\
\midrule
Position Shift & Worsen Position by 1 step for current or next action \\
Fleeting Harm/Condition & Sear, vertigo, chill that matters for this scene \\
Exposure/Noise & Draws notice or complicates stealth \\
Resource Drain & Time, focus, or component damaged \\
Collateral Spark & Threatens ally or fragile thing nearby \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\subsection*{Elemental Backlash Coloring}\index{Backlash!elemental}

On Partial/Miss (or double-1s on a Hit), color consequences by Element:

\begin{fatebox}[Elemental Backlash Coloring]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Element Pair} & \textbf{Minor Backlash} \\
\midrule
Earth / Fate & Slips, binds, encumbrance \\
Fire / Life & Smoke, sparks, heat \\
Air / Luck & Scatter, misheard words \\
Water / Dreams & Slippery tide, slow gear \\
Fate / Earth & Probability resists \\
Life / Fire & Growth surge, vines tether \\
Luck / Air & Odds flip \\
Death / Water & Whispers, chill \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

Backlash should always feel thematic to the magic employed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fire Magic}: Burns, flares, smoke, heat exhaustion, uncontrolled fires
    \item \textbf{Water Magic}: Flooding, slick surfaces, damp-related rot, emotional turbulence
    \item \textbf{Earth Magic}: Tremors, collapsing structures, immobilization, heavy burdens
    \item \textbf{Air Magic}: Unexpected winds, carried sounds, vertigo, scattered plans
    \item \textbf{Fate Magic}: Closed options, inevitable consequences, prophetic nightmares
    \item \textbf{Luck Magic}: Allied misfortunes, fragile successes, random complications
    \item \textbf{Life Magic}: Overgrowth, sympathetic pain, unnatural hunger, fertility curses
    \item \textbf{Death Magic}: Ghostly echoes, premature aging, silence, memory loss
\end{itemize}

\section*{Ritual Casting: Collective Magic}\index{ritual casting}

Some workings require multiple casters pooling their strength. Rituals allow for greater effects but multiply risks.

\subsection*{Ritual Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Declaration}: Primary caster states intent and gathers participants
    \item \textbf{Channel Together}: All participants contribute (Scene-long action)
    \item \textbf{Weave}: Primary caster shapes combined Potential (Scene-long action)  
    \item \textbf{Backlash}: Consequences affect all participants based on their contribution
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Ritual Mechanics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Helper Cap}: Primary caster can draw on ceil(Arcana/2) helpers (max 3)
    \item \textbf{Skill Flexibility}: Helpers may use different relevant skills if fictionally distinct
    \item \textbf{Risk Distribution}: SB from Channel affects individual rollers; SB from Weave affects primary caster
\end{itemize}

\section*{Magic in Combat}\index{magic combat}

Spellcasting in combat follows the same principles but with heightened stakes and immediate consequences.

\subsection*{Combat Casting Considerations}

\begin{fatebox}[Magic in Combat: Position and Effect]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Position} & \textbf{Effect on Magical Actions} \\
\midrule
Dominant & +1 die to Channel; reduced Backlash risk; can maintain subtle effects \\
Controlled & Standard casting conditions; typical risk/reward balance \\
Desperate & -1 die to Channel; increased Backlash severity; may attract unwanted attention \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\subsection*{Tactical Magic Applications}

Magic can reshape combat dynamics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Position Warfare}: Spells that create cover, elevate positions, or restrict movement
    \item \textbf{Morale Effects}: Magic that inspires allies or terrifies enemies
    \item \textbf{Environmental Control}: Creating hazards, altering terrain, manipulating weather
    \item \textbf{Resource Denial}: Destroying enemy equipment, exhausting their supplies
\end{itemize}

\section*{Prestige Magical Abilities}\index{Prestige Abilities!magical}

High-level magical talents represent profound mastery or unique cultural inheritances.

\begin{fatebox}[Example Prestige Magical Abilities]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule

\section*{Free Casting (TAGS System)}
Some casters do not prepare rote rites. They shape raw forces through shared arcane grammar known as \textbf{TAGS}. A spell is constructed at the table using a short phrase of TAGS. You only need the fiction, the TAG selection, and a casting roll.

\subsection*{Spell Structure}
\textbf{Intent} + \textbf{Target} + \textbf{Tags} = effect.

Example formula:
\begin{quote}
``I unleash Burning • Area • Force against the marauders.''
\end{quote}

The GM sets a Difficulty Value (DV) based on TAG complexity and danger.

\subsection*{Base Difficulty Value (DV)}
Start at DV 1 and add +1 for each TAG used.

\begin{center}
\textbf{DV = 1 + number of TAGS}
\end{center}

Adding powerful or perilous TAGS (Teleportation, Transformation, Dominate) adds +2 instead.

Mastery, focus, or appropriate tools may lower DV by 1.

\subsection*{Casting Roll}
Roll \textbf{Wits + Arcana} (or Ritual, Channeling, etc.).  
Success = spell goes off.  
Failure or 1 = Backlash (see below).

\subsection*{Backlash}
Whenever a Free Caster fails—or pushes power beyond safety—the magic pushes back. Choose one:
\begin{itemize}
\item Harm 2 (Arcane)
\item +2 Fatigue
\item Corruption +1
\item Catastrophic side effect (GM describes)
\end{itemize}

If the spell included a ``Dangerous'' TAG, Backlash triggers on \emph{mixed} results as well.

\section*{Design Philosophy: Magic as Narrative Engine}\index{design intent!magic}

Magic in Fate's Edge serves specific design goals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk-Reward Balance}: Every magical act should feel consequential
    \item \textbf{Thematic Consistency}: Magic should reflect the world's metaphysics
    \item \textbf{Narrative Primacy}: Mechanics exist to serve interesting stories
    \item \textbf{Player Agency}: Magic should offer creative solutions, not bypass challenges
    \item \textbf{World Reactivity}: The setting should respond meaningfully to magical use
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{GM Guidance: Making Magic Feel Magical}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Describe the Unseen}: When magic is cast, describe how the world reacts—air crackles, shadows deepen, spirits stir
    \item \textbf{Follow the Consequences}: Magical actions should have lasting effects on the narrative
    \item \textbf{Respect the Elements}: Backlash should feel philosophically appropriate
    \item \textbf{Highlight the Cost}: Make players feel the weight of their magical choices
    \item \textbf{Encourage Creativity}: Reward inventive uses of magic that enhance the story
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Remember}: In Fate's Edge, magic is never a shortcut. It's a pathway filled with wonders and dangers—a tool that changes both the world and the wielder. The dice are not your enemy; they're your collaborator in crafting a world where \textbf{true power always demands an equal price}.
