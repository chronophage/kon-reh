\section*{Optional Rule: Grid-Based Combat}\index{combat!grid-based}\index{optional rules}

While \textbf{Fate's Edge} is designed for theater-of-the-mind play, some groups prefer the tactical clarity of a grid. This optional rule provides a framework for using miniatures or tokens without adding excessive complexity.

\subsection*{Core Concepts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Zones of Control (ZoC)}: Each character exerts control over the squares immediately adjacent to them (typically the 8 surrounding squares). An enemy cannot move \textit{through} a square in another creature's ZoC without first engaging that creature or using a special ability. They can move \textit{around} it.
    \item \textbf{Ranges}: The GM sets ranges based on the narrative and the battlemap size.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Engaged}: In the same square or an adjacent square. For melee combat.
            \item \textbf{Near}: Within a short move (e.g., 5-6 squares). For thrown weapons, short charges.
            \item \textbf{Far}: Requires a full action to move into \textbf{Near} range. For bows, crossbows.
            \item \textbf{Distant}: Beyond \textbf{Far} range, requiring multiple moves or special effort to engage.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Movement}: On their turn, a character can typically move a number of squares equal to 5 + their Body rating. Moving through difficult terrain (rubble, thick mud) may halve this distance or require an Athletics roll.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Actions on the Grid}

The core action resolution remains the same. The grid simply provides spatial context.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Engage}: Move into an enemy's ZoC to enter melee.
    \item \textbf{Attack}: Make a combat roll as normal. Position is determined by the tactical situation (e.g., flanking an enemy might be \textbf{Risky} for you but \textbf{Desperate} for them).
    \item \textbf{Take Cover}: Move behind a terrain feature to improve position (e.g., from \textbf{Desperate} to \textbf{Risky}) against ranged attacks.
    \item \textbf{Flank}: By positioning on opposite sides of an enemy, allies may grant each other assistance dice on attacks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Example Grid Combat}

Valerius is battling two bandits in a ruined temple. The GM sets up a map.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Valerius is \textbf{Engaged} with Bandit A. Bandit B is \textbf{Near} (4 squares away), behind a broken pillar.
    \item Valerius wants to charge Bandit B. He must first disengage from Bandit A's ZoC. The GM rules this is a \textbf{Risky} \textbf{Body + Athletics} roll. He succeeds, avoids an attack of opportunity, and moves into Bandit B's ZoC.
    \item Now engaged with Bandit B, Valerius attacks. The GM rules his position is \textbf{Risky} as Bandit A is now moving up behind him.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Optional Rule: Detailed Warfare}\index{warfare!detailed rules}\index{optional rules}

For campaigns where large-scale battles are a focus, this subsystem provides more granularity for mass combat.

\subsection*{The Army as a Character}

Treat an army as a powerful Follower with its own attributes and clocks.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scale}: The army's size and reach. Adds dice to strategic rolls (e.g., logistics, intimidation).
    \item \textbf{Discipline}: The army's training and morale. Used to resist routing and maintain formation.
    \item \textbf{Supply Clock} (6-8 segments): Tracks food, ammunition, and medical supplies. If filled, the army suffers penalties (e.g., -1 die to all rolls) and risks disintegration.
    \item \textbf{Morale Clock} (6-8 segments): Tracks the army's will to fight. Major defeats, poor conditions, or enemy terror tactics fill this clock. If filled, the army routs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Battlefield Actions}

Instead of individual attacks, characters leading armies make command rolls to achieve objectives. Each objective is represented by a clock.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Break Their Line} (6-segment clock): Use \textbf{Spirit + Command}. Success fills segments. Complications might fill the army's Morale Clock or allow an enemy counter-attack.
    \item \textbf{Flank the Enemy} (4-segment clock): Use \textbf{Wits + Skulduggery}. Requires a successful maneuver roll first.
    \item \textbf{Hold the Line} (Ongoing): Use \textbf{Body + Resolve} to withstand an enemy assault. Failure advances the enemy's objective clocks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Battle's Edge}

Warfare uses a modified Story Beat system called \textbf{The Battle's Edge}. SB generated from command rolls can be spent by the GM to represent the fog of war and battlefield chaos:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1-2 SB}: A unit is out of position. A key piece of intelligence is wrong.
    \item \textbf{3-4 SB}: A trusted officer falls. A supply wagon is lost.
    \item \textbf{5+ SB}: The enemy unveils a secret weapon. The terrain turns against you (e.g., a dam breaks).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Optional Rule: Hex-Based Exploration}\index{exploration!hex-based}\index{optional rules}

For a more structured exploration phase, the GM can map a region using a hex grid.

    \item \textbf{Travel}: Moving into a new hex requires a \textbf{Wits + Survival} roll. The DV is set by the terrain (DV 1 for plains, DV 3 for dense forest or mountains).
    \item \textbf{Discovery}: On a Clean Success, the group discovers any points of interest in the hex automatically. On a Success with Cost or Partial, they might stumble upon a danger first or only get a hint of the interest. On a Miss, they become lost, wasting time and resources.
    \item \textbf{Points of Interest}: Each hex can have a pre-planned location or one generated on the fly using the Travel Deck (Spade=Location, Heart=Encounter, etc.).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Let the Tools Serve You}

These tools and optional rules are not meant to constrain your game---they are meant to \textbf{support your vision}. Use them to keep tension high, consequences real, and the story moving forward. Choose the rules that fit your table's style, and don't be afraid to adapt them on the fly.

The ultimate goal is a collaborative, exciting story. These are just the brushes and paints.
