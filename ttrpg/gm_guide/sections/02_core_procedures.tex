\chapter{Running the Game: Core Procedures}\index{core procedures}

In \textbf{Fate's Edge}, the game flows through a series of \textbf{actions, consequences, and escalating stakes}. As the GM, your role is to guide this flow---not by dictating outcomes, but by \textbf{framing scenes, interpreting rolls, and spending Story Beats}\index{Story Beats} to keep tension alive. This chapter walks you through the core procedures that define play, from the moment a player declares an action to the fallout that follows.

\section{Scene Framing: Start with Stakes}\index{scene framing}

Every scene begins with a question: \textbf{What's at risk?} Not just for the characters, but for the world, the mission, or the fragile alliances they've built. As the GM, you frame the scene by establishing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Position}\index{position}: Is the action \textit{Controlled}\index{position!Controlled}, \textit{Risky}\index{position!Risky}, or \textit{Desperate}\index{position!Desperate}?
    \item \textbf{Effect}: What happens on a success? What changes?
    \item \textbf{Stakes}: What is gained---or lost---if things go wrong?
\end{itemize}

A scene in the \textbf{Mistlands} might begin with the PCs crossing a flooded causeway at dusk. The bell-line hums with tension. The GM sets the position as Risky---slippery stones, rising mist, and the distant echo of a wraith-call. A failure here could mean separation, exposure, or worse.

\subsection{Position Descriptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Controlled}: You act on your terms. Complications are minor, setbacks are rare.
    \item \textbf{Risky}: You act under pressure. Success is possible, but failure brings a cost.
    \item \textbf{Desperate}: The odds are stacked against you. Success is hard-won, and failure is dramatic.
\end{itemize}

Use position to guide the fiction. A controlled entry into a noble salon in \textbf{Vhasia} might allow the PCs to charm or intimidate without resistance. A desperate one---perhaps after triggering an alarm---means blades are drawn before words.

\section{Adjudicating Rolls: The Core Resolution Cycle}\index{roll adjudication}

When a player rolls, they are not simply trying to "beat" a number. They are engaging with the world. This section guides you through the complete resolution process.

\subsection{Step-by-Step Roll Resolution}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Player declares action and approach} (Attribute + Skill).
    \item \textbf{GM sets Difficulty Value (DV)}\index{Difficulty Value (DV)}\index{DV|see{Difficulty Value}} based on stakes and fiction.
    \item \textbf{Player rolls pool of d10s.}
    \item \textbf{Count successes (6+)} and \textbf{Story Beats (1s)}\index{Story Beats}.
    \item \textbf{Compare successes to DV} and apply Outcome Matrix.
    \item \textbf{GM spends SB} or draws from the Deck of Consequences\index{Deck of Consequences}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{fatebox}[Difficulty Ladder (Set Before the Roll)]\index{Difficulty Ladder}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{DV} & \textbf{When to Use} \\
\midrule
2 & Routine: Clear intent, modest stakes, controlled environment \\
3 & Pressured: Time pressure, mild resistance, partial information \\
4 & Hard: Hostile conditions, active opposition, precise timing required \\
5+ & Extreme: Multiple constraints, high precision, dramatic failure possible \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

A DV should reflect not just mechanical difficulty, but narrative weight. Climbing a wall? That's routine. Climbing it while pursued by Aeler vault-wardens? That's pressured---or worse.

\begin{fatebox}[Outcome Matrix]\index{Outcome Matrix}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Result} & \textbf{GM Guidance} \\
\midrule
$S \geq DV$ and $C = 0$ & Clean Success: Deliver the intent crisply \\
$S \geq DV$ and $C > 0$ & Success \& Cost: Grant the intent; spend/bank SB for complications \\
$0 < S < DV$ & Partial: Progress with a fork or complication. Award one boon to the player. \\
$S = 0$ & Miss: No progress. Cash/bank SB, award two boons to player \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\section{Fail Forward: Every Roll Matters}\index{Fail Forward}

When you \textbf{MISS} on a \emph{significant action}, you gain \textbf{1 Boon}. A significant action is one that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item follows the standard procedure (declared intent and approach, DV set, then roll), 
  \item has \textbf{stated stakes} before the roll (what changes on success; what bites on failure), and
  \item lands a \textbf{real consequence} now (the GM spends or banks SB, applies a condition, or advances a thread).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Important Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Rolling a \textbf{1} always creates \textbf{SB} for the GM. Re-rolling \textbf{1}s does not remove SB already generated.
  \item \textbf{No Boon} for rehearsal, null-risk probes, or repeated identical attempts without a new approach, position, or stakes.
  \item \textbf{Controlled} tests with trivial fallout do not award Boons; they're for information or positioning, not currency.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optional Rule: Partial-with-Cost Safety Valve}
By default, \textbf{Partial} does not grant a Boon. If your table wants a little more flow, you may award \textbf{1 Boon} on a \emph{Success \& Cost} when the GM spends \textbf{3+ SB} on that outcome (\emph{max once per scene per character}).

\subsection{Anti-Fishing Measures}
If Boons are spiking, use one or more:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Once/Scene Cap:} At most \textbf{2 Boons from failures} per character per scene (further misses still create SB).
  \item \textbf{Repetition Rule:} Same approach + same stakes in the same scene cannot award another Boon.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example}
Picking a lock under watch (\emph{Risky}, DV 3). Stakes are set: success opens the door; a miss trips the alarm. The roll \textbf{MISS}es; the GM spends 2 SB to start the alarm and tick \emph{Guards Incoming}. The player gains \textbf{1 Boon} from meaningful failure.

\section{Story Beats: The Engine of Drama}\index{Story Beats}

Every time a player rolls a \textbf{1}, a Story Beat is generated. These are not mere penalties---they are narrative levers. Spend them to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Escalate a threat (drawing more enemies, raising the stakes).
    \item Drain resources (time, gear, positioning).
    \item Reveal hidden dangers or betrayals.
    \item Cause collateral damage or unintended consequences.
\end{itemize}

Story Beats should \textbf{push the story forward}, not grind it to a halt. Use them to add pressure, not to punish.

\begin{fatebox}[SB Spend Menu]\index{SB Spend Menu}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{SB Cost} & \textbf{Example Complications} \\
\midrule
1 SB & Minor pressure: noise, trace, +1 Supply segment, brief distraction \\
2 SB & Moderate setback: alarm raised, lose position/cover, lesser foe appears \\
3 SB & Serious trouble: reinforcements arrive, key gear breaks, tactical disadvantage \\
4+ SB & Major turn: trap springs, authority intervenes, scene shifts dramatically \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\subsection{When to Draw from the Deck of Consequences}\index{Deck of Consequences}

The Deck of Consequences is a powerful tool for \textbf{thematic consistency}. When a player generates SB, you may choose to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct Spend}: Translate SB into consequences/rail ticks immediately.
    \item \textbf{Deck Draw}: Draw up to \textbf{min(SB, 3)} cards and \textbf{synthesize a single twist} guided by suit and highest rank.
\end{itemize}

Never do both for the same roll. If the drawn card contradicts established fiction, reinterpret or redraw to fit the suit and tone.

\subsection{High-Tier SB Sinks}\index{High-Tier SB Sinks}
For 3--6+ SB spends that move the world (reputation cascades, faction instability, resonance, prophecy), see the stand-alone \emph{High SB Sinks} handout. A good default: at end of leg, \textbf{3 SB â†’ tick 1 Front}\index{Front}.

\subsection{Banking \& Cashing SB}\index{banking SB}\index{cashing SB}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Banked SB should pay off within the same scene or arc.
    \item Avoid nickel-and-diming. Prefer one memorable complication over many petty penalties.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scene Management Tools}

\subsection{Scene Starters and Hooks}\index{scene starters}\index{hooks}

To keep the game moving, always open a scene with a strong hook:

\begin{itemize}
    \item "The alarm bells ring as you step into the courtyard."
    \item "A courier collapses at your feet, clutching a sealed scroll."
    \item "The tide is turning---the ghost-ferry won't wait."
\end{itemize}

Let the players react. Let the world respond. And always---\textbf{follow the consequences.}

\subsection{Setting Stakes Fast (Cheat Prompts)}\index{stakes setting}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If this goes right, what changes?
    \item If this goes wrong, what bites back?
\end{itemize}

\section{Bond-Driven Resource Generation}\index{bond-driven resource generation}\index{bonds!resource generation}

Players may earn boons by taking significant actions to aid bonded allies while providing intricate descriptions of how their bonds motivate their actions.

\subsection{Adjudication Guidelines}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mutual Bond:} Verify the player and ally share a defined bond
    \item \textbf{Intricate Description:} The description must meaningfully reference the bond's nature
    \item \textbf{Significant Aid:} The assistance must be substantial, not routine help
    \item \textbf{Fiction First:} The bond must genuinely explain the character's motivation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GM Discretion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deny the boon if the action is trivial or the bond reference is superficial
    \item Encourage creative bond references that deepen character relationships
    \item Consider allowing this even when the aiding action fails, if the bond motivation was genuine
\end{itemize}

This mechanic reinforces collaborative play and character relationship development while providing meaningful mechanical rewards for roleplaying.

\section{Integrated Combat Procedures}\index{combat procedures}

Combat in \textbf{Fate's Edge} follows the same core procedures as all other actions, but with specific applications for violent conflict. Every combat action generates potential for both triumph and complication, with consequences that cascade through the same economy as all other challenges.

\subsection{Combat Resolution Procedure}\index{combat resolution}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Declare Action}: Player states intent and approach (Attribute + Skill)
    \item \textbf{Set Position}: GM sets Controlled, Risky, or Desperate based on tactical situation
    \item \textbf{Roll Dice}: Roll pool = Attribute + Skill (takes 1 Player Turn)
    \item \textbf{Count Results}: 6+ = Success, 1 = Story Beat (SB)
    \item \textbf{Apply Outcome}: Use standard Outcome Matrix
    \item \textbf{Manage Consequences}: GM spends SB or draws from Consequences Deck
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Combat-Specific Position Applications}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Controlled}: Advantageous position, minor consequences (flanking, higher ground, surprised foe)
    \item \textbf{Risky}: Even odds, moderate consequences (evenly matched, contested terrain)
    \item \textbf{Desperate}: Disadvantaged, severe consequences (outnumbered, wounded, poor positioning)
\end{itemize}

\begin{fatebox}[Combat Consequence Types by Suit]\index{combat consequences}\index{consequence types!combat}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Suit} & \textbf{Complication Themes} \\
\midrule
Hearts & Morale, fear, command breakdown, psychological pressure, loyalty tests \\
Spades & Physical harm, positioning changes, weapon status, tactical wounds, cover loss \\
Clubs & Resource depletion, gear damage, fatigue, ammunition issues, supply problems \\
Diamonds & Environmental hazards, reinforcements, terrain changes, unexpected events \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\begin{fatebox}[Harm Integration with SB Economy]\index{harm integration}\index{SB economy!harm}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Harm Level} & \textbf{Effects \& SB Generation} \\
\midrule
Harm 1 & -1 die to related actions; generate 1 SB on next 2 rolls \\
Harm 2 & -1 die to most actions; generate 1 SB on next roll until treated \\
Harm 3 & -2 dice to relevant actions; generate 2 SB on next roll; incapacitation risk \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\begin{fatebox}[Tactical Clocks]\index{Tactical Clocks}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Clock Type} & \textbf{Purpose \& Triggers} \\
\midrule
Mob Overwhelm [6] & Enemy numbers become advantage; tick when outflanked or surrounded \\
Fatigue Spiral [4] & Exhaustion affects performance; tick after strenuous actions or wounds \\
Morale Collapse [6] & Fear undermines effectiveness; tick after leader falls or shocking events \\
Environmental [8] & Terrain/fire/building failure; tick after destructive actions or time pressure \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}

\subsection{Position Dynamics in Combat}\index{position dynamics}

Position can shift during combat based on SB spending and narrative triggers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GM Spend (1 SB)}: Shift position one step worse for current action
    \item \textbf{Player Spend (1 Boon)}: Shift position one step better or cancel GM shift
    \item \textbf{Narrative Triggers}: Flanking, reinforcement arrival, environmental changes, superior leverage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Magic Combat Integration}\index{magic combat}

Spellcasting in combat feeds the same consequence economy:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Channel/Weave Backlash SB applies to tactical situation
    \item Spells can shift position, create tactical clocks, or generate combat consequences
    \item Magic consequences cascade through existing combat systems
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Asset/Follower Combat Integration}\index{asset combat}\index{follower combat}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Follower Risk}: 2+ SB spent in combat can endanger assisting followers
    \item \textbf{Asset Compromise}: Combat in certain locations can damage relevant assets  
    \item \textbf{Offensive Activation}: 1 Boon activates asset for combat advantage
    \item \textbf{Initiative Actions}: Followers can take combat-relevant independent actions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Combat Outcome Matrix Application}

Same as standard resolution, but consequences are combat-specific:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clean Success}: Intent achieved with no tactical complications
    \item \textbf{Success \& Cost}: Intent achieved, but GM spends SB for combat consequences
    \item \textbf{Partial}: Progress with tactical fork (accept cost OR concede ground)
    \item \textbf{Miss}: No progress; GM spends SB for combat consequences. Award one Boon.
\end{itemize}

\section{30-Second Adjudication Loop}\index{adjudication loop}

Use this fast procedure to keep the game flowing:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Clarify}: "What do you want, and how?"
    \item \textbf{Set Stakes}: "If it works, what changes? If it fails, what bites?" Start Risky/Standard unless fiction says otherwise.
    \item \textbf{Roll \& Read}: Count successes (6+) and SB (1s). Compare to DV.
    \item \textbf{Spend One Beat Well}: Cash SB on one memorable twist or tick a relevant Clock.
    \item \textbf{Push Forward}: Describe how the fiction changes; ask "Who moves next?"
\end{enumerate}

\section{Position + Effect in Action}

A player declares a \textbf{Risky} action to \textbf{pick a lock} while guards patrol above. They roll \textbf{Wits + Skullduggery}, get 3 successes and 1 Story Beat.

The GM consults the Outcome Matrix: \textbf{Success \& Cost}. The lock clicks---but a guard's bootstep halts above. The GM spends 1 SB to add tension: the patrol changes direction, heading toward the PCs' position.

\section{Common Pitfalls and Solutions}\index{pitfalls}\index{GM tips}

\begin{fatebox}[Troubleshooting Common Issues]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Issue} & \textbf{Solution} \\
\midrule
Over-cranking SB & Halve SB spends temporarily or convert to visible Clocks \\
Clock Sprawl & Merge redundant Clocks; scenes need only 2-3 active Clocks \\
Tag Paralysis & Paraphrase: "Sounds like [TAG]. DV 3. Want to roll?" \\
Rules Drift & Pick ruling that keeps flow, note TODO for post-session reconciliation \\
Boon Inflation & Enforce 2 Boon/scene cap from failures; use Repetition Rule \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{fatebox}
