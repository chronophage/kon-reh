1.  **Patronage and Power Dynamics:**
    *   **Patrons:** Powerful entities (like Malachai, Aveh, Maelstraeus, Raéyn, The Sealed Gate, etc.) offer power through Rites, Invocations, or Cantos, but demand service, adherence to themes, or accumulate Obligation/Corruption. Managing these relationships is a constant political game.
    *   **Runekeepers/Invokers/Cantors:** Characters tied to Patrons navigate the expectations, rivalries, and consequences associated with their chosen power source, influencing their actions and allegiances.
    *   **Patron Rivalries:** Explicit rivalries exist (e.g., Malachai vs. Oath of Flame & Light, Aveh vs. Varnek Karn, Inquisitor Prime vs. Outsiders). Aligning with one Patron can create friction or enemies tied to another.

2.  **Regional Governance and Conflict:**
    *   **Fractured Authority (Vhasia):** The "Two Crowns" and competing claimants create a political landscape rife with intrigue, shifting loyalties, levies, and the constant threat of Chevauchée. Legitimacy itself becomes a currency and a target.
    *   **Federated Complexity (Vilikari):** Balancing Utaran remnants, Utaran law, steppe customs ("Two Laws"), and relationships with neighbors like Ykrul and Linn involves intricate diplomacy and internal negotiation.
    *   **Dwarf Holds (Aeler):** Authority is tied to specific locations, lineages, and guilds (like True Masons). Navigating their laws, tolls, and jurisdictional disputes is crucial.
    *   **Merchant Republics (Kahfagia, Silkstrand, Thepyrgos):** Power often lies with merchant guilds, factors, and factors influenced by trade, coin-houses, and economic leverage. Controlling routes, markets, and credit is key.
    *   **Tribal/Family Structures (Ykrul, Linn, Aelaerem, Ubral):** Loyalty often stems from kinship, clan, or hearth. Politics involve managing feuds, fulfilling oaths (geasa), guest-right, and navigating complex social hierarchies (like the Thing in Linn or the Moot in Theona).
    *   **Theocracy (Ecktoria's Everflame, Valewood's Fae Courts):** Religious authority directly influences law and politics, creating potential conflicts with secular power or rival faiths.
    *   **Frontier Tensions:** Regions on borders (like Ubral, Vilikari, Mistlands) must navigate relationships and potential conflicts with multiple neighbors, often involving treaties (foedus), levies, and careful balancing acts.

3.  **Institutional Power:**
    *   **Guilds (Ecktoria, Kahfagia, Silkstrand):** Guilds hold significant economic and social power, controlling crafts, trade, and sometimes political representation. Navigating guild politics, gaining favor, or avoiding their wrath is important.
    *   **Military Structures (Black Banners, Condotta):** Mercenary companies and standing armies are major players. Politics involve contracts, loyalty, payment, and the shifting dynamics of war and peace.
    *   **Legal Systems (Utaran Law, Aeler Measure, Viterra's Hedge-Law, Thepyrgos Synods):** Understanding and manipulating different legal frameworks is a form of politics. This includes using courts, precedents, charters, and rights strategically.
    *   **Magical Orders/Institutions (Runekeepers, Colleges of Magic in Thepyrgos):** Those who wield magic often form their own power structures or are integrated into existing ones, adding another layer of influence and potential conflict.

4.  **Resource Control and Economic Leverage:**
    *   **Trade Routes:** Controlling or taxing key passages (mountain passes, straits, rivers, bridges) grants significant power and can be a source of conflict.
    *   **Key Resources:** Control over essential goods (salt, iron, grain, wine, dye) provides leverage. Scarcity or abundance directly impacts political stability.
    *   **Titles and Charters:** Owning land, holding noble titles, possessing specific legal rights (like bridge farms, toll rights, market licenses) grants authority and income, making their acquisition and retention a political goal.

5.  **Social Currency and Reputation:**
    *   **Honor and Oaths (Ykrul, Ubral, Vilikari):** Breaking oaths or losing honor carries significant social and sometimes physical consequences, shaping political interactions.
    *   **Reputation Tiers:** As characters gain fame (or infamy), they attract attention, allies, and rivals, changing how they interact with the world's power structures.
    *   **Favor and Debt:** The exchange of favors, hospitality, and incurred debts (like Rescue Debt, Hostage Treaty) creates webs of obligation that are central to many political dealings, especially in regions like Theona or among the Linn.

These politics are deeply embedded in the setting's mechanics (like Obligation, Geasa, charters, and specific regional rules) and the narrative consequences encouraged by the system, making political maneuvering a core part of the gameplay experience.
