# The Penitent Lich — Runekeeper Patron

**Lore**
The Penitent Lich is a Patron of names kept, vows witnessed, and debts made visible. Power flows through confession, restitution, and the binding force of true names. Once mortal, now an anchor of memory, he refuses oblivion until every name he harmed is spoken correctly and set in its rightful place. He grants power to those who lift names, keep watches, and choose mercy first.

**Portfolio:** true names • oaths • remembrance • wards • restitution

**Symbols:** a guttering candle; a ledger ribbon; a ring that won't warm; a mirror shard.

**Favored Deeds:** return a name to the world; bury the unburied; witness a vow without centering yourself; refuse an easy cruelty.

## Tenets (Keep These)
1. **Name the Harmed:** When you act, speak who is owed—not what you want.
2. **Mercy Before Might:** Try a nonviolent avenue before you draw steel or spell.
3. **Watches Are Kept, Not Owned:** If you take a ward, keep it—or find a worthy keeper.
4. **Debt Is Not Silence:** Confess, repair, and let the record show it.
5. **No Erasures:** Do not profit by deleting names, histories, or lineages.

## Obligation
Starts at 5 for Tier II characters, scaling with tier.

**Hard Obligation Triggers:**
- Obligation 8+: The Lich demands you name one person you've wronged and make amends. Refusal marks you neglectful: worsen Position by one step in related social rolls until penance is made.
- Obligation 10+: Your truth-telling becomes compulsive. You cannot lie about past misdeeds, even to protect yourself. Requires a quest to find balance.

## Persistent Condition: Truthbound
Bonding deeply with the Penitent Lich may grant the Truthbound condition. Effect: +2 Insight to detect deception or hidden truths; -1 die to social rolls involving privacy or deception. Narrative: You see through lies but cannot easily tell them yourself; others sense your commitment to honesty.

## Rivalries
- **Mab (Glamour, Courts):** Tension—Mab weaves illusions while the Lich demands truth.
- **Varnek Karn (Ossuary, Dominion of the Dead):** Opposition—Varnek sustains the dead's business, the Lich seeks their rest.
- **The Pale Shepherd (Thresholds, Guidance):** Subtle friction—both deal with endings, but the Shepherd guides while the Lich binds.
