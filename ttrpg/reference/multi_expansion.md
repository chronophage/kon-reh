# Integrating Multiple Modules for a GM

Based on the comprehensive Fate's Edge expansion materials provided, here's strategic advice for integrating multiple modules effectively.

## Core Integration Principles

### 1. **Start with the Campaign Frame**
Choose one expansion as your primary framework:
- **Political Intrigue** for court-focused campaigns
- **Caravans** for trade/road narratives  
- **Black Banners** for military campaigns
- **Amaranthine Sea** for naval adventures
- **Wilds** for frontier/exploration themes

The other modules then serve as supporting elements rather than competing systems.

### 2. **Map Overlapping Mechanics**
Most expansions use the core Fate's Edge mechanics (Position/DV, SB, clocks, Strings) which makes integration natural. Focus on:
- **Clock systems** - Many modules have 4-8 segment clocks that can represent different pressures
- **String economies** - Assets, Patrons, and Organizations all provide leverage through similar mechanics
- **Social SB menus** - Several modules offer specific complications that can be mixed

## Specific Integration Strategies

### **Political + Caravan Integration**
- Use **Political Intrigue's** faction system for trade relationships
- Caravan **Market procedures** become political negotiation tools
- **Strings** like trade charters and harbor rights feed into political influence
- Example: A caravan company's success improves their political standing, while political connections grant better trade terms

### **Black Banners + Any Campaign**
- **Condotta contracts** can drive any adventure type
- **Company tracks** (Payday/Supply/Cohesion) add campaign continuity to other modules
- **Allegiances system** provides ongoing pressure in any setting
- Banner companies can serve as rivals, allies, or employers in other storylines

### **Psionics + Any Module**
- Psionic **Fatigue tracks** integrate with existing harm systems
- **Telepathy** enhances investigation procedures in Political Intrigue or Horror
- **Precognition** can provide advance warning of threats from any module
- **Astral Projection** offers reconnaissance in dungeon-delve or wilderness scenarios

### **Dragon's Lair + Wilderness/Political**
- **Lair generators** can create wilderness locations with unique hazards
- **Named dragons** become political actors with their own faction dynamics
- **Hoard items** serve as powerful artifacts in any campaign
- Dragon cults provide ongoing political pressure and adventure hooks

### **Threshold Folk + Urban/Political**
- **Small folk cultures** add depth to urban districts
- **Realm tracks** (Threshold Sense, Visibility) complement city Heat systems
- **Gifts** provide unique capabilities that interact with urban procedures
- Underground communities become political factions with their own interests

### **Sands of Moon & Brass + Caravans/Political**
- **Desert trade routes** create political tensions between oasis states
- **Qanat sabotage** becomes both wilderness hazard and political tool
- **Council moots** can resolve trade disputes that Caravans creates
- **Oath systems** provide alternative to contract law in trade relationships

### **Lethai + Political Intrigue**
- **Forest/commons law** vs. state power creates natural political friction
- **Silence Furlongs** become diplomatic border zones
- **Mask-right parley** adds complexity to political negotiations
- **Lethai-ar web-law** can be used to bind multi-party political agreements

## Managing Complexity

### **Layered Clock Management**
Rather than tracking every possible clock, use a **"Three Clock Rule"**:
1. Primary campaign pressure (from your main module)
2. Immediate scene/leg pressure (travel, investigation, combat)
3. Character/group specific pressure (personal obligations, faction standing)

Other pressures can be handled through **SB spends** or converted to these core clocks.

### **Cross-Module Currency Conversion**
- **Favor/Leverage/Exposure** systems appear across multiple modules - treat as universal currencies
- **Strings** are portable advantages that work across contexts
- **Boons** provide a common resource economy
- **Reputation tiers** can track advancement across different social spheres

### **Mechanical Harmonization Matrix**

| Module A | Module B | Harmonization Strategy |
|----------|----------|----------------------|
| Wilds Weather | Sea Weather | Use harsher effect when both apply |
| Political Mandate | Caravan Reputation | Convert 2:1 (2 Political = 1 Caravan tier) |
| Psionic Fatigue | Standard Fatigue | Psionic Fatigue converts 1:1 to standard Fatigue |
| Black Banner Supply | Caravan Supplies | Black Banner Supply = 2 Caravan Supplies |
| Threshold Visibility | City Heat | High Visibility = +1 City Heat risk |

## Practical Integration Examples

### **"The Merchant Prince's War" Campaign**
**Primary:** Political Intrigue + Caravans
- Political factions compete through trade embargoes and route control
- Caravan **Market procedures** become political tools
- **Faction sheets** track both political influence and economic power
- **Situation clocks** might be "Border Dispute [6]" while **Faction clocks** track "Merchant Guild Influence [6]"
- **Integration hook**: Desert trade routes (Sands) become political flashpoints

### **"Storm over the Violet Steppe" Campaign**  
**Primary:** Caravans + Wilds + Threshold Folk
- Weather becomes a major pressure (Wilds' Weather Matrix)
- **Threshold folk communities** provide safe havens and unique challenges
- Caravan **Supply/Morale** tracks interact with wilderness survival
- **Beast Pressure** from Wilds module creates ongoing threat during travel
- **Integration hook**: Lethai forest commons provide alternative routes and political complications

### **"The Sunken Conspiracy" Campaign**
**Primary:** Amaranthine Sea + Political Intrigue + Psionics
- Naval **Blockade systems** create political pressure
- **Psionic telepathy** enhances investigation procedures
- **Faction standing** affects harbor access and patrol behavior
- **Underwater exploration** uses wilderness procedures with naval hazards
- **Integration hook**: Threshold folk underwater communities provide psionic amplification

### **"The Desert Trade Wars" Campaign**
**Primary:** Sands of Moon & Brass + Political Intrigue + Black Banners
- **Council moots** arbitrate trade disputes that escalate to military action
- **Condotta contracts** drive military campaigns over trade routes
- **Desert hazards** affect both caravan travel and military movements
- **Oath systems** provide alternative to political contracts
- **Integration hook**: Lethai forest peoples provide neutral ground for negotiations

## GM Workflow Integration

### **Preparation Phase**
1. **Choose 2-3 primary modules** for your campaign
2. **Identify overlapping elements** (clocks, currencies, complications)
3. **Create a unified reference sheet** with key procedures from each
4. **Prep 2-3 cross-module connections** per session
5. **Establish bridge NPCs** who connect different module elements

### **Session Management**
1. **Start with the primary module's procedures** for scene framing
2. **Layer in elements from supporting modules** as complications or opportunities
3. **Use SB menus** to introduce cross-module pressures
4. **Track only essential clocks** - convert others to tags or complications
5. **Rotate focus** between modules to maintain engagement across systems

### **Campaign Continuity**
1. **Use Assets & Patrons** system for long-term holdings that span modules
2. **Apply Allies & Adversaries** system for recurring NPCs across contexts
3. **Track reputation** through unified systems rather than module-specific metrics
4. **Let module-specific consequences** create cross-module story threads
5. **Maintain a "connection log"** of how different modules have interacted

## Handling Module Conflicts

When modules have competing mechanics:
1. **Default to the campaign's primary module** for core procedures
2. **Use the most thematically appropriate** option for flavor
3. **Convert mechanical effects** to match core systems (Position/DV adjustments, clock ticks)
4. **Ask "which makes the story more interesting?"** rather than which is more "correct"
5. **Create hybrid solutions** that blend elements from both systems

### **Conflict Resolution Priority**
1. Player agency and story coherence > mechanical consistency
2. Primary campaign module > supporting modules  
3. Simple solutions > complex ones
4. Established fiction > new mechanics
5. Group consensus > GM fiat

## Module Compatibility Ratings

### **Natural Synergies**
- **High**: Caravans + Political Intrigue + Sands
- **High**: Black Banners + Amaranthine Sea + Psionics
- **Medium**: Wilds + Threshold Folk + Dragon's Lair
- **Medium**: Political Intrigue + Lethai + Violets & Stone

### **Potential Friction Points**
- **Low**: Horror Campaigns + Black Banners (tone mismatch)
- **Low**: Threshold Folk + Amaranthine Sea (scale mismatch)
- **Medium**: Psionics + Dragon's Lair (power level concerns)

## Enhanced Practical Examples

### **"The Council of Caravans" Campaign Structure**
**Primary:** Sands of Moon & Brass + Political Intrigue
**Supporting:** Caravans, Lethai

**Campaign Arc 1**: Desert trade route disputes escalate to council moots
- **Sands**: Qanat water rights become political flashpoints
- **Political**: Faction influence affects council outcomes
- **Caravan**: Market success/failure drives political pressure
- **Lethai**: Forest peoples offer neutral mediation ground

**Campaign Arc 2**: Council decisions trigger broader political realignments
- **Integration**: Caravan route changes affect political alliances
- **Complication**: Lethai forest law conflicts with new trade agreements
- **Climax**: Joint council/moot session with cross-module representation

### **Session Structure Template**
**Opening** (15 min): Module-specific situation setup
**Development** (45 min): Cross-module complications emerge
**Climax** (30 min): Primary module resolution with supporting module stakes
**Resolution** (15 min): Cross-module consequences and setup for next session

## Final Integration Tips

1. **Start simple** - Add one module at a time to an existing campaign
2. **Focus on narrative connections** over mechanical optimization  
3. **Use module-specific complications** to introduce elements from other modules
4. **Create "bridge" NPCs** who connect different module elements (a psionic caravan broker, a political dragon cultist)
5. **Remember that all modules use the same core resolution system** - this is your integration anchor
6. **Maintain a "what's the fun part?" filter** - if integration isn't making the game more interesting, simplify
7. **Document successful combinations** for future reference
8. **Be prepared to abandon integration attempts** that aren't working for your table

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **"My players are ignoring the supporting modules"**
- Make supporting module elements essential to primary module success
- Create personal stakes for each player in different modules
- Rotate which module provides the "break" in each session

### **"The mechanical complexity is overwhelming"**
- Use the "Three Clock Rule" ruthlessly
- Convert complex mechanics to simple Position/DV adjustments
- Create cheat sheets for cross-module interactions

### **"The campaign feels scattered across too many themes"**
- Establish clear campaign themes that unite the modules
- Create an overarching antagonist that interacts with all module elements
- Develop a consistent cast of NPCs who appear across different contexts

The key to successful multi-module integration is viewing each expansion not as a separate game within a game, but as a toolkit of procedures and fictional elements that can enhance your primary campaign theme while maintaining mechanical coherence through the shared Fate's Edge foundation. Focus on story connections over mechanical perfection, and remember that the goal is to make your campaign more engaging, not more complicated for its own sake.
