  \begin{itemize}
  \item Spend downtime repairing/servicing it, or\index{Assets!Downtime Repair}

\subsection{Bond-Driven Resource Generation}\index{Resources!Bond-Driven Generation}
When a player takes a significant action to aid an ally with whom they share a bond, and explicitly references that bond in an intricate description, they may mark that bond to gain 1 boon after the action resolves.\index{Bonds!Resource Generation}

\textbf{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mutual Bond:} Player shares a bond with the ally they're aiding\index{Bonds!Mutual Requirement}
    \item \textbf{Intricate Description:} Player describes how their bond motivates their action\index{Description Ladder!Intricate Action}
    \item \textbf{Significant Aid:} Meaningful assistance (not just +1 die)\index{Followers!Significant Aid}
    \item \textbf{Fiction First:} The bond must genuinely drive the choice to help\index{Fiction First}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Remembering how they saved me before, I throw myself in front of the attack meant for them!"
    \item "Thinking of our shared past, I use my last resource to shield them from harm."
    \item "Drawing on our mutual experiences, I rally others to keep fighting alongside them."
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limitations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Once per bond per session\index{Bonds!Session Limit}

    \item Trigger: If the party enters a scene with â‰¥ 3 structural advantages, apply Over-Stack once for that scene: either start one named rail at +1 or the GM banks +1 SB for the first Deck Twist.\index{Combat!Over-Stack Trigger}
