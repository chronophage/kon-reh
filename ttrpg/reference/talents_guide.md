Absolutely. Creating new Talents is a great way to expand player options and reinforce the game's themes. Here are several new Talents for **Fate's Edge**, designed to fit seamlessly into the existing XP cost structure and core mechanics.

These are organized by theme and power level.

---

### 🧠 New Minor Talents (2-4 XP)

#### **Echoing Strike (3 XP)**
*Requirements: Melee 2+*
**Effect:** When you strike an enemy with a melee attack, the sound of the impact resonates unnaturally. Until the start of your next turn, that enemy is considered **Marked**. The next attack against the Marked enemy by you or an ally gains **+1d**.
*Narrative: You learn to strike with a rhythm that disrupts an enemy's guard, leaving them vulnerable.*

#### **Patron's Glare (3 XP)**
*Requirements: Spirit 2+, Bonded to a Patron*
**Effect:** You can channel a sliver of your Patron's authority. Once per scene, as an action, force a single mortal target in Near range to test Spirit vs. DV 3. On a failure, they are **Shaken** and act with **-1d** on their next action. This has no effect on otherworldly beings like Outsiders.
*Narrative: Your eyes briefly flash with the sigil of your Patron, striking fear into the hearts of mortals.*

#### **Ritual Anchor (4 XP)**
*Requirements: Arcana 2+ or Runekeeper*
**Effect:** You are adept at stabilizing magical energies. When you Assist an ally who is Casting a spell or performing a Ritual, you may spend 1 Boon when you declare the assist. If you do, the first 1 rolled on the casting roll does not generate a Story Beat.
*Narrative: You provide a steady hand or a calming chant, helping to contain volatile magic.*

#### **Savage Fury (4 XP)**
*Requirements: Body 3+*
**Effect:** When you take Harm from a physical attack, you may immediately mark 1 Fatigue to gain **+1 Effect** on your next melee attack against the creature that harmed you. This bonus must be used before the end of the scene.
*Narrative: Pain doesn't slow you down; it only makes you more dangerous.*

### ⚔️ New Major Talents (6-8 XP)

#### **Ghost-Walker Step (7 XP)**
*Requirements: Stealth 3+, Wits 3+*
**Effect:** You can move between shadows as if they were doors. Once per scene, as a Move action, you may teleport from your current location to any other area of shadow or deep concealment within Far range. You immediately gain the benefits of being Hidden.
*Narrative: You have learned the secret paths that lie in the spaces between light and dark.*

#### **Oath-Breaker's Bane (8 XP)**
*Requirements: Presence 3+, Insight 2+*
**Effect:** You hold others to their word with supernatural force. When you witness a creature break a promise or oath they made to you, you may mark 1 Obligation (to a Patron of Justice or Vengeance) to curse them. The oath-breaker suffers **-1d** to all rolls for the next scene, or until they atone for their broken word to your satisfaction.
*Narrative: Your sense of justice is so potent that reality itself punishes those who betray your trust.*

#### **Runic Feedback (7 XP)**
*Requirements: Runekeeper, Codex*
**Effect:** You turn a Patron's own power against those who would misuse it. When you successfully [DISPEL] an ongoing magical effect or Rite, you may channel the shattered energies. The original caster suffers a Minor Backlash, and you gain 1 Boon.
*Narrative: You don't just unravel spells; you snap them like a taut wire, lashing the caster with the recoil.*

#### **Volley of a Thousand Arrows (8 XP)**
*Requirements: Ranged 4+*
**Effect:** You unleash a breathtaking hail of projectiles. Once per scene, make one ranged attack against every valid target in a 90-degree arc within Near range. Roll once and compare your successes to each target's individual DV. You cannot apply **Great Effect** with this talent.
*Narrative: For a single, terrifying moment, you become a storm of death.*

### 👑 New Prestige Talents (10-12 XP)

#### **Dual Patronage (12 XP)**
*Requirements: Runekeeper, Spirit 4+*
**Effect:** You have learned the forbidden art of serving two masters without being immediately torn apart. You may form a pact with a second Patron, gaining a second Thiasos and Codex.
*   You track **Obligation separately** for each Patron.
*   You may use Rites from both Codices.
*   **The Price:** Whenever you Invoke a Rite from one Patron, you immediately mark **+1 Obligation** with the *other* Patron (representing their jealousy and scrutiny). Pushing a Rite triggers this cost for both.
*Narrative: You walk a razor's edge, playing cosmic powers against one another. It's only a matter of time before you fall.*

#### **Soul-Bound Weapon (10 XP)**
*Requirements: Weapon Master, Spirit 3+*
**Effect:** You have poured a fragment of your own spirit into a single weapon, making it an extension of your will.
*   The weapon is permanently considered **Imbued** with a thematic skill of your choice, even without Patron's Gift.
*   You can summon it to your hand from anywhere on the same plane of existence as a free action.
*   If the weapon is ever destroyed, you take 2 Harm that cannot be reduced by Armor, but you can reform the weapon over a Significant Time of meditation.
*Narrative: You and your weapon are one. Its fate is your fate.*

#### **Word of Unmaking (12 XP)**
*Requirements: Cantor's Path, Lore 4+*
**Effect:** You have discovered a syllable of creation's opposite, a word that unravels reality itself. Once per story arc, you may speak the Word.
*   **Effect:** Choose one of the following to unmake:
    *   A single, non-legendary magical item (it dissolves into dust).
    *   A summoned Outsider of Cap 3 or less (it is instantly [BANISHED]).
    *   A section of a structure no larger than a castle wall (it collapses).
*   **Cost:** Speaking the Word fills your **Corruption Clock immediately** and you gain 2 Fatigue.
*Narrative: You hold a secret that the universe was not meant to know. Using it changes you, leaving a void where something vital used to be.*

### 🕵️‍♂️ New Talent Trees (Connected Talents)

#### **The Infiltrator Path**

**Keen-Eyed Scout (3 XP - Minor)**
*Requirements: Notice 2+*
**Effect:** You have a knack for spotting the unseen. You gain **+2d** on rolls to detect traps, hidden doors, or concealed creatures. When you succeed on such a roll, you may point out the detail to an ally, granting them **+1d** on their first interaction with it.

**Trap-Breaker's Cunning (6 XP - Major)**
*Requirements: Keen-Eyed Scout, Tinker 2+*
**Effect:** You can disable complex mechanisms with breathtaking speed. Disarming a trap requires only one action instead of Significant Time. Furthermore, when you successfully disable a trap, you may "store" its mechanism. Once per scene, you can spend 1 Boon to recreate that trap's effect in a similar environment (e.g., a swinging blade, a gas jet).

**Ghost in the Machine (10 XP - Prestige)**
*Requirements: Trap-Breaker's Cunning, Wits 4+*
**Effect:** You don't just avoid security; you turn it to your advantage. You can spend 10 minutes to study a location's defensive patterns (guards, magical wards, patrol routes). After doing so, you may once per scene spend 2 Boons to declare that you have "pre-set" the environment. For the next exchange, all allies in the area gain **+1 Position** on all rolls, as alarms misfire, guards get lost, and wards flicker at the worst possible time for your enemies.

### 💡 Design Notes for Creating New Talents

When you create more Talents, keep these *Fate's Edge* principles in mind:

1.  **Cost = Impact + Flexibility:** A 2-4 XP Talent should provide a situational bonus or a new minor option. An 8+ XP Talent should be a scene-defining power.
2.  **Interact with Core Systems:** The best Talents play with SB, Boons, Position, Effect, and Clocks. They should feel like part of the game's engine.
3.  **Narrative Weight:** A Talent's name and description should inspire roleplaying. "Savage Fury" tells you more about a character than "+1 to damage."
4.  **Create Interesting Choices:** Talents like *Dual Patronage* are powerful but come with a built-in, escalating cost that drives story.
5.  **Avoid Pure Number Inflation:** Talents that just give +1d to everything are boring. Instead, give +2d in a specific, flavorful situation (like *Keen-Eyed Scout*).

These new Talents provide more avenues for character specialization, from the mystical (*Word of Unmaking*) to the tactical (*Volley of a Thousand Arrows*) and the high-risk (*Dual Patronage*). They should give players more ways to engage with the game's core themes of risk, consequence, and supernatural bargains.
