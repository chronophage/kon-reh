\title{\textbf{The Last Light of the Everflame: The Lampers vs. The Temple of Light}}
\author{}

\maketitle

\section{Logline}
As the sacred flame that has burned in Ecktoria for centuries begins to die, the ancient rivalry between the Lampers and the Temple of Light erupts into open conflict, forcing the player characters to choose sides in a battle that will determine the future of faith itself.

\section{Core Theme}
The conflict between tradition and innovation - when a sacred truth begins to fail, is it better to die with the old ways or risk everything to create something new?

\section{The Rivalry: Lampers vs. Temple of Light}

\begin{description}
    \item[Lampers (Traditionalists)] Guardians of the flame, who believe the flame must be protected at all costs
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Philosophy}: The flame is a gift from the gods that must be preserved exactly as it is. To change it is to profane it.
        \item \textbf{Methods}: Rituals passed down for centuries, strict adherence to tradition, protective wards
        \item \textbf{Leaders}: High Lamper Aris Thorne (a stern traditionalist) and the Circle of Elders
        \item \textbf{Grievance}: The Temple of Light seeks to ``improve'' the flame, which they see as a heresy
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[Temple of Light (Reformers)] Believers that the flame's decline is a sign that it must evolve or be replaced
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Philosophy}: The flame is not static but should evolve with the times. Its decline is a call for renewal.
        \item \textbf{Methods}: New rituals, experimental techniques, attempts to ``renew'' the flame through science and faith
        \item \textbf{Leaders}: High Luminary Seraphina Vale (charismatic reformer) and the Council of Illumination
        \item \textbf{Grievance}: The Lampers are allowing the flame to die rather than embracing necessary change
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsection{The History of the Rivalry}
For 200 years, these two institutions have been locked in a cold war over the flame:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Schism of 1278}: The Temple split from the Lampers after a theological dispute
    \item \textbf{The War of Light (1322)}: A brief but violent conflict that was eventually contained
    \item \textbf{The Current Tension}: As the flame falters, both sides see this as proof their approach is correct
\end{itemize}

\section{Player Hooks}

\begin{itemize}
