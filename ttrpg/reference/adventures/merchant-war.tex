\end{resolution}

\section{Rewards and Consequences}

\end{itemize}

\section{GM Notes}

\subsection{Social Dynamics}
Emphasize social aspects of conflict:
\begin{itemize}
\item Every interaction has social stakes and long-term consequences
\item Reputation affects access to resources and opportunities
\item Social manipulation as important as economic warfare
\item Class tensions between old nobility and new merchants
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Economic Realities}
Make economic warfare tangible:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rising prices affecting ordinary citizens
\item Job losses and business closures throughout city
\item Disrupted supply chains creating shortages
\item Economic pressure driving people to extreme measures
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Moral Ambiguity}
Present complex moral landscape:
\begin{itemize}
\item Neither faction entirely good or evil
\item House Valdris: Stability vs. resistance to progress
\item Crimson Sails: Innovation vs. disruption of communities
\item Players face genuine moral choices with consequences
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Player Agency}
Provide multiple paths to influence conflict:
\begin{itemize}
\item Work for one side exclusively
\item Play both sides against each other
\item Work to end war entirely
\item Create third option through revolutionary change
\item Focus on personal objectives while navigating conflict
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Urban Environment}
Use Silkstrand's unique features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Bridges create vertical complexity and strategic points
\item Dyeworks provide industrial hazards and valuable resources
\item Waterways offer transportation and smuggling routes
\item Archivolt represents bureaucratic maze and legal complexity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Story Beats}
Use economic conflict for complications:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 SB: Minor business disruption, small price fluctuation
\item 2 SB: Key contact becomes suspicious, shipment delayed
\item 3 SB: Major sabotage incident, faction leader threatened
\item 4+ SB: City-wide economic crisis, faction headquarters attacked
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Session-Specific Guidance}

\textbf{Session 1 Focus:} Establish conflict dynamics and player involvement. Players should understand both factions have strengths and weaknesses.

\textbf{Session 2 Focus:} Deepen faction involvement and escalate consequences. Players gain significant influence but face moral complexity.

\textbf{Session 3 Focus:} Climactic resolution with city-wide implications. All previous elements converge in final choices about Silkstrand's future.

\subsection{Alternative Endings}

If players attempt unconventional solutions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Information Broker Path:} Become neutral facilitator profiting from both sides
\item \textbf{City Guardian Role:} Work directly for Matron to maintain balance
\item \textbf{Foreign Intervention:} Invite external power to resolve conflict
\item \textbf{Economic Innovation:} Create new business model transcending faction divide
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scaling for Different Tiers}

\textbf{Tier II (Seasoned):} Standard economic and social challenges, local city scope.

\textbf{Tier III (Veteran):} Add regional political implications, foreign trade complications, and more powerful faction resources.

\textbf{Tier IV (Paragon):} Introduce international trade war consequences, faction gains patron backing, threat to entire trade network.
