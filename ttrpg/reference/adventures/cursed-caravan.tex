\section{Premise}

A merchant caravan has been cursed while crossing the Pale Causeway, causing supplies to rot, animals to die, and strange omens to appear. The players must escort the caravan to safety while dealing with the curse's escalating effects. However, they soon discover that the curse is tied to a larger conspiracy involving a powerful entity that feeds on suffering and despair, and that the caravan's troubles may be just the beginning of something far worse.

\section{Hook}

The adventure begins when the players encounter one of the following scenarios (Investigation + Notice vs DV 3 to determine truth):
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Desperate Merchant:} They find the caravan stalled on the road, with Merchant Aldric Thorne desperately seeking help for his dying animals and rotting supplies. He offers them a substantial reward to help get the caravan to the nearest settlement. (Social encounter, Presence + Sway vs DV 3)
\item \textbf{False Accusation:} A Margravine's bounty poster shows the players' faces with the accusation that they're responsible for the curse, forcing them to investigate to clear their names. (Investigation + Subterfuge vs DV 4)
\item \textbf{Witch's Warning:} Hedge-Witch Mira Blackwood approaches them in a tavern, warning that something dark is moving along the trade routes and that they may be the only ones who can stop it. (Social encounter, Presence + Insight vs DV 3)

\section{GM Notes}

\subsection{Atmosphere and Tone}
Emphasize the bleak, desperate atmosphere of Acasia:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use descriptions of withered crops, gray skies, and desperate people
\item Make supernatural elements feel genuinely threatening and alien
\item Create sense of isolation and hopelessness that makes supernatural solutions tempting
\item Balance horror with folk wisdom and community resilience
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Folk Horror Elements}
Use local customs and superstitions authentically:
\begin{itemize}
\item Specific folk practices should have mechanical effects
\item Local knowledge should be valuable and hard to find elsewhere
\item Supernatural threats should be tied to regional folklore
\item Community responses should reflect genuine cultural practices
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Moral Ambiguity}
Present difficult choices without clear right answers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each resolution path should have significant costs and benefits
\item NPCs should have complex motivations rather than simple good/evil
\item Supernatural forces should be neither entirely benevolent nor malevolent
\item Player choices should have lasting consequences that affect character development
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Escalating Tension}
Gradually increase supernatural threat level:
\begin{itemize}
\item Session 1: Minor disturbances and growing unease
\item Session 2: Clear supernatural manifestations and local knowledge
\item Session 3: Direct confrontation with entity and community crisis
\item Session 4: Climactic encounter with legendary figure and final choice
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Player Agency}
Provide multiple paths to resolution:
\begin{itemize}
\item Investigation approach: Master curse mechanics and find proper solution
\item Social approach: Negotiate with factions and supernatural entities
\item Direct action approach: Confront threats through force or ritual
\item Moral approach: Make difficult choices that affect curse's ultimate fate
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Story Beats}
Use curse's influence to generate complications:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 SB: Minor supernatural manifestation, small equipment failure
\item 2 SB: NPC becomes temporarily possessed, important item goes missing
\item 3 SB: Major curse escalation, community member suffers serious harm
\item 4+ SB: Entity direct intervention, climactic supernatural event
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Session-Specific Guidance}

\textbf{Session 1 Focus:} Establish supernatural threat and desperate situation. Players should feel immediate need to help while sensing something deeper is wrong.

\textbf{Session 2 Focus:} Deepen supernatural elements and introduce local knowledge. Players learn curse has ancient, complex origins requiring specialized solutions.

\textbf{Session 3 Focus:} Escalate to community-wide crisis and direct supernatural confrontation. Players must make difficult choices under pressure.

\textbf{Session 4 Focus:} Climactic resolution with moral complexity. All previous elements converge in final choices with lasting consequences.

\subsection{Alternative Endings}

If players attempt unconventional solutions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Community Solution:} Rally local population to perform massive protective ritual
\item \textbf{Entity Alliance:} Negotiate with Hungering Dark to become its agent
\item \textbf{Folk Hero Path:} Become legendary figures who regularly deal with supernatural threats
\item \textbf{Cursed Path:} Become cursed themselves but gain supernatural powers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scaling for Different Tiers}

\textbf{Tier II (Seasoned):} Standard supernatural threats, manageable curse effects, local community scope.

\textbf{Tier III (Veteran):} More powerful entities, curse spreading to multiple communities, regional political implications.

\textbf{Tier IV (Paragon):} Ancient conspiracy involving multiple cursed objects, entity gains patron backing, threat to entire region.
