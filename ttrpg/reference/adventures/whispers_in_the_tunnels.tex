\section{Adventure Summary}

A canal gate deep in the Aelerian underways has failed catastrophically, flooding a section of the ancient water system that serves several hillhold communities. The True Masons investigating the failure blame a forged countermark in a human mint, but the human authorities deny any wrongdoing. As the dispute escalates, both sides prepare for a moot that could determine whether the dwarven guilds maintain control over their infrastructure or if human authorities will intervene with their own "solutions."

The PCs are drawn into this conflict when they discover that the failure wasn't just mechanical - something ancient and hungry has awakened in the flooded tunnels, and it's using the broken seal to extend its influence beyond the underways.

\section{Adventure Hooks}

\subsection{Primary Hook: The Broken Seal}

A canal gate stamped with three guild marks fails catastrophically, flooding a section of the ancient water system. A True Mason crew blames a forged countermark in a human mint, but human authorities deny any wrongdoing.

\subsection{Secondary Hook: Edge of the Treaty}

The dispute has created an "embargo by inaction" - while both sides argue, the affected communities suffer without proper water access. Bandits thrive in the chaos unless someone can pry loose the ledger-knot that's strangling the negotiations.

\section{Key Locations}

\subsection{1. Flooded Canal Junction (Under-Market Area)}

The initial disaster site where the adventure begins. Water from higher elevations has flooded this section of the underways, making traditional investigation difficult.

\textbf{Key Features:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Deep water (4 feet) with limited visibility
\item Ancient stonework showing signs of something having clawed at the walls
\item Remnants of the broken gate mechanism
\item Strange, cold mist that rises from the water
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hazards:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Environmental Collapse Clock (6 segments) - structural integrity degrading
\item Hazard 1 from unstable masonry
\item Fatigue 1 per hour from the unnatural cold
\end{itemize}

\subsection{2. Under-Market (Lantern Alleys)}

The commercial heart of the underways where the initial investigation takes place.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{4. Human Enclave (Trade Court)}

The stone court where human merchants operate, representing the human side of the dispute.

\textbf{Key NPCs:}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Features:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Surface-style architecture adapted to the underways
\item Banking ledgers that rival dwarven records
\item Tension between wanting to maintain good relations and defending human interests
\end{itemize}

\subsection{5. The Ancient Reservoir}

The source of the flooding and the awakening ancient entity.

\textbf{Key Features:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Massive underground chamber with a deep, dark pool
\item Carved warnings in stone-tongue that predate the current dwarven holdings
\item Evidence of something having been sealed away long ago
\item The entity that has awakened and is using the broken seal to extend its influence

\section{Adventure Flow}

\subsection{Opening Scene: The Flooded Junction}

The adventure begins with the PCs arriving at the flooded canal junction, either as investigators, merchants affected by the disruption, or simply passing through. The area is chaotic with rescue efforts and investigation work.

\textbf{Initial Complications:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Environmental Collapse Clock (6 segments) - structural damage from flooding
\item Tension between dwarven and human authorities
\item Strange cold mist that seems to sap energy
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Investigation Opportunities:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Examining the broken gate mechanism (Wits + Engineering)
\item Speaking with rescue workers (Presence + Sway)
\item Searching for survivors or clues in the debris (Wits + Survival)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rising Action: The Investigation}

As the PCs investigate, they'll encounter both dwarven and human factions, each with their own perspective on what happened. The True Masons are convinced of human forgery, while human authorities are equally convinced of dwarven incompetence.

\textbf{Key Scenes:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The Under-Market Inquiry} - Meeting with dwarven officials to understand their position
\item \textbf{The Trade Court Negotiation} - Speaking with human representatives to hear their side
\item \textbf{The True Masons' Workshop} - Learning about the repair cult's methods and beliefs
\item \textbf{Following the Flood} - Tracing the water back to its source to understand the full scope
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Investigation Clocks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Truth Discovery (6 segments) - How quickly the PCs uncover the real cause
\item Faction Tension (8 segments) - Rising conflict between dwarves and humans
\item Environmental Degradation (6 segments) - Ongoing structural damage from flooding
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Climax: The Ancient Reservoir}

The investigation leads to the ancient reservoir where the PCs discover that the flooding wasn't just mechanical failure - something ancient has awakened and is using the broken seal to extend its influence. The entity is corrupting those who come too close, turning them into agents of further destruction.

\textbf{Key Challenges:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Resisting the entity's mental influence (Spirit + Resolve)
\item Navigating the physically dangerous environment
\item Making difficult choices about how to deal with the awakened entity
\item Preventing further corruption of both dwarven and human factions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Resolution: The Moot}

The adventure concludes with a moot where the PCs must present their findings and help mediate between the factions. The solution they choose will have lasting consequences for the relationship between dwarves and humans in this region.

\textbf{Possible Resolutions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The Truth Revealed} - If the PCs can prove what really happened, both factions might work together to contain the entity
\item \textbf{Compromise Solution} - A joint dwarven-human effort to create a new, stronger seal
\item \textbf{Faction Victory} - Either side could claim victory, but at the cost of souring relations
\item \textbf{Sacrificial Containment} - Someone must make a great sacrifice to contain the entity permanently
\end{enumerate}

\section{Adventure-Specific Rules}

\subsection{The Corruption Mechanic}

As the PCs investigate the ancient reservoir, they risk becoming corrupted by the Drowned One's influence. This is tracked through a Corruption Clock (4 segments) that advances when:
\begin{itemize}
\item Spending time near the reservoir
\item Failing Spirit rolls when exposed to the entity's whispers
\item Making selfish or harmful choices influenced by the entity
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effects of Corruption:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 segment: Minor personality changes, -1 die to social rolls with dwarves
\item 2 segments: Moderate corruption, gain a Complication Point on all rolls
\item 3 segments: Severe corruption, -2 dice to all rolls, hostile to former allies
\item 4 segments: Complete corruption, character becomes an NPC under GM control
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Curing Corruption:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Leaving the area reduces corruption by 1 segment per day
\item Dwarven purification rituals (requires Spirit-Shield talent or assistance)
\item Destroying the source of corruption (completing the adventure)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Moot Procedure}

The final moot uses a special social conflict system:

\textbf{Positions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Controlled}: You have strong evidence and support
\item \textbf{Risky}: You have some evidence but face opposition
\item \textbf{Desperate}: You're arguing against strong evidence or prejudice
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Social Clocks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Faction Support} (6 segments) - How much each side supports your position
\item \textbf{Evidence Weight} (4 segments) - How compelling your arguments are
\item \textbf{Time Pressure} (6 segments) - The moot is running long, tempers flare
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Winning the Moot:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Clean Success: Your solution is adopted with full support
\item Success \& Cost: Your solution works but creates new complications
\item Partial: You make progress but must accept concessions
\item Miss: Your position is rejected, and you face backlash
\end{itemize}

\section{Rewards and Consequences}

\subsection{Immediate Rewards}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Experience Points}: 8-12 XP for completing the main investigation
\item \textbf{Boons}: 1-2 Boons for creative problem-solving
\item \textbf{Faction Standing}: Improved relations with either dwarves or humans (player choice)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Long-term Consequences}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dwarven Relations}: How the PCs handled the investigation affects their standing with Aeler guilds
\item \textbf{Human Relations}: The human enclave remembers how the PCs treated their representatives
\item \textbf{True Masons}: The repair cult's opinion of the PCs based on their respect for ancient works
\item \textbf{Regional Stability}: The resolution affects trade and safety in the underways
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prestige Opportunities}

\item \textbf{Spirit-Shield}: If they show great wisdom in dealing with ancestral matters
\item \textbf{Margravine's Warrant}: If they impress human authorities with their diplomatic skills
\end{itemize}

\section{GM Notes and Variations}

\subsection{Scaling the Adventure}

\textbf{For Lower-Tier Parties (Rookie)}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduce the complexity of the investigation
\item Provide more obvious clues
\item Make the True Masons less hostile
\item Focus on the immediate mechanical problems rather than the ancient entity
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For Higher-Tier Parties (Veteran/Paragon)}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Add more factions with competing interests
\item Make the ancient entity more powerful and cunning
\item Introduce political ramifications that extend beyond the local area
\item Create connections to larger regional or national conflicts
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Alternative Hooks}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ancestor's Veto}: The Spirit Shields halt repair work when bones sing warnings about the reservoir
\item \textbf{Avenger's Shadow}: An Iron Avenger cell targets someone involved in the investigation for an old slight
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Theme Reinforcement}

This adventure emphasizes core Aeler themes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Vault builders}: The importance of infrastructure and the dangers of its failure
\item \textbf{Ledger keepers}: The conflict between dwarven and human record-keeping systems
\item \textbf{Soft power in hard rock}: How the PCs navigate factional politics rather than just fighting
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Clock Management Tips}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use the Environmental Collapse clock to create urgency
\item Let the Faction Tension clock drive NPC behavior
\item Use the Corruption clock to create personal stakes for the PCs
\item The Investigation clock should resolve before the climax
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

"The Broken Seal" offers a classic Fate's Edge experience that combines investigation, social conflict, and supernatural horror within the unique context of Aeler culture. The adventure challenges players to navigate complex factional relationships while dealing with both mundane and otherworldly threats, all while the world around them reacts to their choices with meaningful consequences.

The module is designed to showcase what makes Aeler society unique - their focus on infrastructure, their complex relationship with human neighbors, and their reverence for ancestral wisdom - while providing multiple paths to success that reward different play styles and character approaches.
