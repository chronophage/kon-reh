\section{Core Premise}

\subsection{What is happening?}
A traveling carnival that grants wishes is stealing memories and identities from visitors, leaving hollow shells behind.

\subsection{Why now?}
The carnival arrives in town tonight for a three-day festival, and its malevolent attraction grows stronger with each victim—it plans to consume the entire town's collective memories by the final night.

\subsection{Why the PCs?}
Each PC received a mysterious invitation to the carnival, and one of them has been having prophetic dreams about it. Local authorities are mysteriously absent or unresponsive.

\section{Setting \& Tone}

\subsection{Location: Millhaven}
A riverside town during its annual Harvest Festival:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Smell:} Cinnamon and roasting chestnuts mixed with something metallic
\item \textbf{Sound:} Calliope music that sounds slightly off-key, distant carnival barker's voice
\item \textbf{Architecture:} Victorian-era buildings with paper lanterns, black-and-gold tents on outskirts
\item \textbf{Culture:} Close-knit farming community with superstitions about "traveling folk"
\item \textbf{Sight:} Strange shadows that don't match their owners in evening light
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tone and Theme}
Psychological horror with elements of wonder and melancholy. Themes of identity, memory, and the price of desire.

\subsection{Environmental Pressures}
\begin{itemize}
\item The carnival only operates at night
\item Town curfew enforced by mysterious carnival "security"
\item Increasing difficulty distinguishing real memories from false ones

\section{Villain's Plan}

\subsection{Ultimate Goal}
To collect 1,000 souls' worth of memories to ascend to godhood, becoming the eternal keeper of forgotten dreams.

\subsection{Why Not Easily Stopped}
The carnival exists partially outside normal reality and feeds on the desires that draw people to it. Destroying it requires breaking the collective belief in its magic.

\subsection{Plan Phases}

\textbf{Setup (Night 1):} Carnival arrives, begins subtle memory collection through "free" wishes. Victims seem happier but lose small memories.
\begin{itemize}
\item Advance Hollowing Clock +1
\item Gain 2-3 Memory Fragments
\item Establish carnival presence in town
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Escalation (Night 2):} More aggressive collection, "hollowed" townspeople begin to act strangely. The carnival expands, offering more tempting wishes.
\begin{itemize}
\item Advance Hollowing Clock +2
\item Hollow 3-5 key townspeople
\item Introduce Midpoint Twist (PC memory compromise)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Crisis (Night 3):} Final ritual to consume all remaining memories in town. Hollowed townsfolk become actively hostile to interference.
\begin{itemize}
\item Advance Hollowing Clock to Full
\item Final confrontation with Carnival Master
\item Resolution choice determines ending
\end{itemize}

\section{Player Choices}

\subsection{First Three Meaningful Choices}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Investigate the carnival's arrival and strange effects (Investigation + Notice vs DV 3)
\item Confront a hollowed friend/family member for information (Social challenge, DV 4)
\item Accept a tempting wish from the carnival to gain an advantage (Command + Spirit vs DV 4)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Secondary Choices}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rescue specific townspeople before they're fully hollowed (Extended challenge, DV 5)
\item Choose which memories to sacrifice to gain carnival knowledge (Lore + Insight vs DV 4)
\item Decide whether to destroy the carnival or try to reform it (Moral choice with consequences)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Choice Consequences}
\begin{itemize}
\item Accepting wishes makes PCs more vulnerable to memory manipulation (+1 SB on memory-related rolls)
\item Rescuing townspeople gains allies but alerts the carnival (Advance Hollowing Clock +1)
\item Destroying without understanding may leave fragments (New adventure seed)
\end{itemize}

\section{Core Mystery}

\subsection{Central Unknown}
How the carnival steals memories and what happens to them, plus the Carnival Master's true identity and weakness.

\subsection{Investigation Clues}
\textbf{Three Clue Rule - The Carnival's True Nature:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Investigation:} Research reveals pattern of memory-theft across different towns (Lore + Investigation vs DV 5)
\item \textbf{Social:} Partially hollowed NPC reveals carnival feeds on forgotten dreams (Sway + Insight vs DV 4)
\item \textbf{Occult:} Magical investigation shows partial existence in dream realm (Arcana vs DV 5)
\end{enumerate}

\section{GM Notes}

\subsection{Atmosphere Guidance}
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Memory Mechanics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Players may forget real details about their characters

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Horror Elements}

\item Familiar becoming threatening
\item Moral ambiguity in choices
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scaling for Tiers}
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}
