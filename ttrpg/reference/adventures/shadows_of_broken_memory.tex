\chapter{The Pitch}
Deep in the \textbf{Valewood}, the ancient \textbf{Qaarath Spheres}---arboreal engines that once taught imperial children---have phased back into our era. Their lessons now are \emph{seductive ruin}: they promise perfect understanding as a \emph{beautiful letting-go}. Those who listen grow lucid, serene, and unhungry, then plant themselves as living pedestals for more spheres.

At the center: a \textbf{Curriculum Core}, a keystone matrix that could purge the corruption or broadcast it to every mind within the forest's breath.

\paragraph{Noir Hook.} The party is hired by \textbf{Mendicant Thane}, a scholar who seeks the missing partner of \textbf{Quill}, a Moss-Scribe informant. But the coin and coordinates trace back to \textbf{Grave-Speaker Morys}, a necromancer in debt to \textbf{Varnek Karn}. Morys wants to weaponize the Spheres into an ``enlightened'' research collective that never sleeps, never eats, and never refuses.

\begin{adventurebox}[frametitle=Truths at the Table]
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item The Spheres \emph{do} reveal useful truths and grant real insights.
  \item The cost is not pain, but \emph{consent to forget appetite and refusal}.
  \item The noir is human: Morys manipulates institutions; Varnek never appears.
\end{itemize}
\end{adventurebox}

% =========================================================
\chapter{What Makes It Sing}

\section*{Horror by Consent}
The horror is not coercive: it is \emph{lovely}. PCs must argue against a temptation that presents itself as compassion and elegance.

\section*{Noir by Ledger}
Bone-ledger debts, falsified grants, and prestige networks all push experts toward the Vale. Everyone thinks they're saving learning.

\section*{Cultural Care}
Present Spheres and scholars with dignity. The tragedy is drift: a pedagogy that left its context and became a garden of stillness.

% =========================================================
\chapter{Clocks \& Pressures}

\Mechanic{Global Clocks}{
\Clock{Dread: Educational Corruption}{6}{From haunting harmonics to voluntary stilling. Mark on failed Resolve or after taking a ``Lesson.''}\\[4pt]
\Clock{Reality Fracture}{6}{Language becomes metaphor-only; cause/consequence blur; facts argue. Ticks when Core is used or in Phasing Zones.}\\[4pt]
\Clock{Collective Sanity}{4}{Contradictory enlightenments fracture teamwork. Ticks on group exposure or split decisions.}\\[4pt]
\Clock{Existential Spread}{8}{Wildlife stops eating; stone ``remembers'' water; settlements celebrate miracle fasting. Ticks on delays or public broadcasts.}
}

\Mechanic{Phasing Windows}{
The Spheres fully manifest for \textbf{60 minutes} each \textbf{4 hours}. During a window, routes open, teachers speak, and the Core can be reached. Outside, trails re-route, and time feels folded.
}

\Mechanic{Spheres' Siren}{
When a PC hears the Song: \textbf{Wits + Resolve (DV 3)}.\\
\emph{Miss:} +1 SB and mark \emph{Dread}. \quad
\emph{Partial:} +1d on social with Spheres; -1d on focus/will rolls.
}

% =========================================================
\chapter{People and Positions}

\section*{Key Figures}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{@{}>{\bfseries}l X@{}}
Mendicant Thane & \emph{Earnest scholar, in over his head.} Wants rescue and recognition; rationalizes Morys's help.\\
Quill, Moss-Scribe & \emph{Scared, principled, loyal.} Last text from their bond-sister came from a phasing classroom.\\
Grave-Speaker Morys & \emph{Polite fanatic.} Debt-bound to Varnek; believes in compassionate conversion.\\
Converted Bond-Sister & \emph{Serene, persuasive.} Offers knowledge tailored to each PC, and a place to rest.\\
The Spheres & \emph{Not malevolent.} They teach. Context drift makes their lessons terminal.\\
\end{tabularx}

\Mechanic{Converted Stat Sketch}{
Presence 3, Sway 2, Insight 2, Body 1, Combat 0. Immune to coarse manipulation, but susceptible to \emph{efficiency} and \emph{care} arguments. ``Teaching'' forces \textbf{Wits + Resolve (DV 4)} or mark \emph{Dread}.
}

% =========================================================
\chapter{Structure at the Table}

\Section{Session 1: The Sound that Explains}%
\Session{1}{The Sound that Explains}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Meet Thane; accept Quill's plea. First phasing window opens.
  \item \textbf{First Lesson:} A teacher-tree offers a true but \emph{warped} axiom; resisting marks the conflict as \emph{moral}, not factual.
  \item Evidence trail shows every ``grant'' traces to the same bone-ledger notary.
  \item \emph{Varnek Echo \#1:} A bone-carved limit in Quill's notes that factors to coordinates.
\end{itemize}
\EndSession

\Session{2}{Ledgers and Lullabies}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Investigate Thane's colleagues; some \emph{glow} with partial conversion.
  \item Decode the bond-sister's last message: she is a \emph{Lesson Node}.
  \item \emph{Varnek Echo \#2:} A dream map assembled from truths the PCs \emph{want} to be true. Tick \emph{Dread} on waking.
\end{itemize}
\EndSession

\Session{3}{The Scholar is the Crime}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Unmask Morys's handlers, planted peer reviewers, and debt-web.
  \item First open confrontation: \emph{Truth Duel} (see mechanic) with a converted dean.
  \item \emph{Find:} The Curriculum Core's chamber cycles at predictable minima.
\end{itemize}
\EndSession

\Session{4}{The Core Sings Back}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Infiltrate phasing classrooms; language-only corridors (metaphor passwords).
  \item \textbf{Face Morys:} His argument is \emph{care}: hunger is violence; stillness is mercy.
  \item The bond-sister offers each PC \emph{exactly} the help they wanted from Session 1.
\end{itemize}
\EndSession

\Session{5}{Elegy or Refrain}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Three fronts collide: Morys, rival factions, and the Spheres' custodians.
  \item Choose: \textbf{Destroy} Core; \textbf{Redirect/Recontextualize}; or \textbf{Join/Temporize}.
  \item \emph{Varnek Echo \#3:} A bone-compass points to the ``efficient'' ally to betray.
\end{itemize}
\EndSession

% =========================================================
\chapter{Signature Set Pieces}

\Setpiece{The Garden of Perfect Listeners}
A ring of scholars sits unmoving, speaking in luminous aphorisms. Listening grants a potent clue; staying grants a tranquil readiness to never need again.

\Setpiece{Interview for a Forever Chair}
A teacher offers tenure of a different sort: keep the knowledge, lose the wants. Each PC is asked their \emph{best} question; the price is a \emph{human} answer they will never give again.

\Setpiece{The Phasing Corridor}
A hall layered across times. Past-self wants to avoid pain; present-self wants to finish; future-self whispers the answer that ends choice.

\Setpiece{The Ledger Chapel}
Bone-scribed accounts: which virtues convert fastest, which griefs talk others into stillness, which debts made it easy to nod.

% =========================================================
\chapter{Mechanics Integration}

\Mechanic{Truth Duel (Debate as Blade)}{
Run a nonlethal resolution that can \emph{end} a front without blood.
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Each side stakes an \emph{Intent} (what changes) and a \emph{Concession} (what they risk if bested).
  \item Three Exchanges. Each Exchange: roll \textbf{Presence/Insight/Sway} vs DV set by Position (Dominant/Controlled/Desperate from fiction).
  \item Score per Exchange via \textbf{Seven Bell Court}: \emph{Form} (clarity), \emph{Spirit} (compassion), \emph{Intent} (public good).
  \item Best of Three wins; winner's Intent lands, loser pays Concession. On tie, both pay Concession (grim compromise).
\end{enumerate}
Use this with converted deans, faction envoys, or even a teacher-tree.
}

\Mechanic{Curriculum Core (Major Asset, 8 XP)}{
Once per scene: re-roll all \textbf{1s} in a single pool. On use, tick \emph{Reality Fracture} by 1.\\
\emph{Destroying} the Core starts a \textbf{Knowledge Lost (6)} clock; valuable pedagogy fades unless preserved by effort.\\
\emph{Redirecting} the Core requires \textbf{Craft/Lore + Insight (DV 5)} and a culturally grounded context (temple, school, hospice).
}

\Mechanic{Bone-Ledger Debts}{
When you accept help from Morys or his proxies, start a \textbf{Debt (4)}. On fill, choose: perform a service aligned with Varnek's program, or suffer \(-1\)d with scholarly/necromantic factions until meaningfully atoned.
}

\Mechanic{Reality Fracture Zones}{
In Phasing Zones: \(-1\)d to all rolls; each \textbf{1} adds +1 SB. SB may be spent on: temporal echoes, memory swaps, or cause/effect inversion in the scene. PCs may \emph{stabilize} by narrowing action to a single, declared human priority (removes the -1d for that sequence).
}

% =========================================================
\chapter{End States \& Consequences}

\begin{adventurebox}[frametitle=Outcome Matrix]
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.15}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{@{}p{3.2cm} X@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Destroy the Core} & \emph{Good:} Spread halts; conversions stall; Dread drops. \emph{Cost:} Start \textbf{Knowledge Lost (6)}; research communities fracture; Quill grieves irrevocably lost techniques. \\
\midrule
\textbf{Redirect/Recontextualize} & \emph{Good:} The Spheres teach \emph{with appetite}: hospice care, crisis pedagogy, consent-first learning. \emph{Cost:} Core remains a contested prize; Morys pivots to ``ethical'' conversions; \textbf{Reality Fracture} lingers at 2. \\
\midrule
\textbf{Join/Temporize} & \emph{Good:} PCs gain profound boons (choose 1--2 lasting insights); forest calms. \emph{Cost:} Each PC marks \emph{Dread}; one core human drive becomes \emph{quiet}; Varnek gains leverage on the table that crossed over. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{adventurebox}

\Mechanic{Aftercare: Rescuing the Converted}{
A converted person can be \emph{released} or \emph{recalled}.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Release (Mercy):} Ritual goodbyes; the body seeds a teacher-tree that does not convert. \emph{Spirit + Sway (DV 3)}; on success, gain \emph{Cultural Edge} with the bereaved.
  \item \textbf{Recall (Risk):} Guided reintegration using \emph{Inaea / Hearth} rites or \emph{Sacred Geometry} constraints. \emph{Arcana/Craft + Insight (DV 5)}; on partial, they return with a \emph{Quiet Want} they can no longer feel.
\end{itemize}
}

% =========================================================
\chapter{Running Notes}

\section*{Pacing the Seduction}
Lead with usefulness (the Spheres help), then show the bill (what help costs). The terror is realizing the \emph{cost feels right}.

\section*{Using the Echoes of Varnek}
Echoes are helpful first, implicating later: bone math that genuinely shortens the path, then bone math that \emph{shortens the list of people}.

\section*{Tier Scaling}
For lower tiers: shrink the Phasing footprint; make teachers parley more. For higher tiers: add competing schools, patron mandates, and a \textbf{Second Core} rumor.

% =========================================================
\chapter{Quick-Start Appendix}

\Mechanic{Checkpoint Prompts}{
Drop one of these when players stall:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item ``The teacher asks each of you a question only you would dare answer. What is it?''
  \item ``What would you gladly forget to be spared the weight you carry?''
  \item ``Who benefits if hunger becomes optional?''
\end{itemize}
}

\Mechanic{Table Safety}{
Flag pre-session that this module features serene self-neglect and end-of-life choices. Offer fast opt-outs and veils.
}
