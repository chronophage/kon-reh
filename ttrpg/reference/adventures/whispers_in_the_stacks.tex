\section{Campaign Overview}

\subsection*{\faMap\ Campaign Hook}

\textbf{The Premise:} The PCs are scholars, researchers, or investigators who have been drawn to the ancient University of Thepyrgos, renowned for its vast archives and the mysterious Synod Hall where "judgment [is] audible at a whisper." They've come seeking knowledge, but find instead that the very architecture of the city seems to harbor dark secrets.

\textbf{Real Hook:} The University's ancient towers and labyrinthine stacks conceal more than forgotten texts. Something has awakened in the spaces between knowledgeâ€”perhaps connected to the "General watch" that once seized carts "for the walls." The whispered judgments in Synod Hall are no longer just legal proceedings, but something far more sinister. The entity feeds on the accumulated fears and secrets of centuries of scholars, students, and seekers who have passed through these halls.

\textbf{Thematic Elements:} Isolation, Unknown Threats, Psychological Decay, Escalating Tension, Moral Ambiguity

\textbf{Key Horror Elements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Isolation:} Characters are cut off from help within the University complex
    \item \textbf{Unknown Threats:} The enemy cannot be easily understood or fought
    \item \textbf{Psychological Decay:} Mental stability becomes as important as physical health
    \item \textbf{Escalating Tension:} Fear builds throughout the campaign
    \item \textbf{Moral Ambiguity:} Survival may require compromising principles
\end{itemize}

\section{Custom Horror Mechanics}

\subsection*{\faSkull\ Special Campaign Mechanics}

\textbf{The Whispering Mechanic:}
When in the ancient towers or stacks of the University, PCs must make Wits + Lore rolls (DV 3) to resist hearing the entity's whispers. Each failure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generates 1 CP that the GM can spend for psychological effects
    \item Advances Dread Clock by 1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
    \item May reveal useful but disturbing information
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Whisper Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item "The books remember your name..."
    \item "Knowledge has a price..."
    \item "The Matriarch waits for you in Synod Hall..."
    \item "Your companion's thoughts are not their own..."
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sacred Geometry Perception:}
When PCs observe the ancient architecture of the University, particularly in Synod Hall or the older towers, they must make Wits + Investigation rolls (DV 4) to avoid comprehension effects. Each failure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generates 2 CP that the GM can spend for reality distortions
    \item Advances Dread Clock by 2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
    \item May grant forbidden knowledge at great psychological cost
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Geometry Manifestations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Corridors that should be straight but bend impossibly
    \item Rooms that are larger on the inside than the outside
    \item Symbols that shift when not directly observed
    \item Stairs that lead to different floors depending on the direction of approach
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Knowledge Corruption:}
PCs who reach 7+ Dread segments begin to show physical signs of the entity's influence:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Eyes that reflect unusual colors in darkness
    \item Speaking in whispers without realizing it
    \item Attraction to dark, enclosed spaces like the ancient stacks
    \item May be able to communicate with the entity through forbidden knowledge
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Corruption Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item +1 die to Lore rolls involving forbidden knowledge
    \item -1 die to social rolls due to unsettling presence
    \item Can perceive multiple timeline branches (generates 2 CP per scene)
    \item Permanent reality distortion (narrative consequence)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Collective Dread:}
The party's collective Dread affects their perception of the University:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Average Dread level determines reality stability
    \item High average = shared hallucinations, impossible events become real
    \item Low average = grounding effect, some resistance to cosmic influence
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Collective Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shared visions of the entity's true form
    \item Impossible architectural changes that affect all PCs
    \item Collective memory gaps about recent events
    \item Enhanced group paranoia and infighting
\end{itemize}

\section{Resolution Paths}

\subsection*{\faDoorOpen\ Campaign Endings}

\textbf{The Sacrifice:}
Permanently seal the entity using ancient techniques, but it requires one PC to remain behind as a living anchor.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Success means the entity is contained, but at great personal cost
    \item Award 15-18 XP
    \item The sacrificed PC becomes a guardian spirit, occasionally communicating through whispers
    \item The University remains but is forever changed - some areas are permanently sealed
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Escape:}
Flee with evidence of the threat, warning other settlements. The entity remains but is contained for now.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Award 10-12 XP
    \item Create ongoing campaign thread
    \item The University becomes a quarantined zone
    \item The entity's influence spreads slowly to neighboring regions
    \item PCs become hunted by those who want to suppress the truth
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Corruption:}
Allow the entity to partially manifest, gaining its power but becoming its servants.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transform PCs into agents of horror
    \item Award 8-10 XP but fundamentally change character nature
    \item PCs gain supernatural abilities but lose humanity
    \item They become extensions of the entity's will
    \item The University becomes a hub for the entity's expansion
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Investigation:}
Fully understand the entity and find a way to banish it without sacrifice.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Requires significant research and resources
    \item Award 18-20 XP if successful, but very difficult
    \item Must gather knowledge from multiple forbidden texts
    \item Requires cooperation with corrupted NPCs
    \item Success permanently seals the entity but weakens the fabric of reality in the area
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Bargain:}
Negotiate with the entity to limit its influence in exchange for specific concessions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Award 12-15 XP with ongoing supernatural responsibilities
    \item The entity agrees to limit its feeding in exchange for periodic offerings
    \item PCs become mediators between the entity and the living
    \item The University becomes a neutral ground for otherworldly negotiations
    \item Creates potential for future conflicts when the bargain is tested
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\faExclamationTriangle\ Important Reminders}

\textbf{Horror Campaign Guidelines:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Consent First:} Discuss comfort levels and boundaries with players before starting
    \item \textbf{Pacing Matters:} Horror is most effective when tension builds gradually
    \item \textbf{Player Agency:} Ensure players always have meaningful choices, even in hopeless situations
    \item \textbf{Consequences Feel:} Make the impact of player decisions clear and lasting
    \item \textbf{Atmosphere Counts:} Use description and sensory details to create unease
    \item \textbf{Fear Rewards:} Let players feel powerful even when afraid
    \item \textbf{Sanity Management:} Make mental trauma meaningful, not punitive
    \item \textbf{Hope Endures:} Even in darkness, give players reasons to continue
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Campaign Integration:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scale:} This campaign operates on a university level but has regional implications
    \item \textbf{Comprehension:} Understanding the threat may be as dangerous as ignoring it
    \item \textbf{Permanence:} Changes to reality may be irreversible
    \item \textbf{Isolation:} The PCs may be among the few who perceive the true threat
    \item \textbf{Legacy:} Actions taken will echo through the University's future
\end{itemize}

\textbf{GM Tools:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Whisper Deck:} Prepare 20-30 entity whispers that reveal information while increasing dread
    \item \textbf{Geometry Cards:} Create index cards with architectural impossibilities for quick reference
    \item \textbf{Corruption Tracker:} Note which PCs show signs of knowledge corruption
    \item \textbf{Reality Anchor:} Keep one location in each session that remains "normal" for grounding
    \item \textbf{Escape Routes:} Always provide at least one way out, even if costly
    \item \textbf{Hope Tokens:} Small positive developments that remind players their actions matter
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Session End Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cliffhangers:} End sessions on moments of tension to maintain engagement

    \item \textbf{Character Check:} Note any PC corruption or psychological changes
    \item \textbf{Foreshadowing:} Plant seeds for next session's revelations
    \item \textbf{Player Feedback:} Ask what scared or intrigued them most
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Campaign Conclusion:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Legacy Creation:} Determine how the University changes based on resolution
    \item \textbf{Character Evolution:} Note permanent changes to PCs' psyches and abilities
    \item \textbf{Ongoing Threats:} Establish potential sequel hooks if players want to continue
