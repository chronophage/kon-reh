\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Welcome to the University of Thepyrgos}

In the ancient city of Thepyrgos, where knowledge is both currency and curse, the PCs find themselves drawn to the University's towering spires and labyrinthine stacks. What begins as scholarly pursuit quickly transforms into a descent into paranoia and cosmic horror as they discover that the very architecture of learning harbors dark secrets.

This adventure module, "Whispers in the Stacks," challenges your players with unknown threats that lurk in the spaces between knowledge, where isolation breeds fear and the pursuit of truth becomes a dangerous obsession.

\subsection{Module Overview}

\textbf{Adventure Hook:} The PCs are scholars, researchers, or investigators who have been drawn to the ancient University of Thepyrgos, renowned for its vast archives and the mysterious Synod Hall where "judgment is audible at a whisper."

\textbf{Setting:} The University of Thepyrgos - ancient towers, labyrinthine stacks, and the ominous Synod Hall where legal proceedings blend with supernatural influence.

\textbf{Themes:} Isolation, Unknown Threats, Psychological Decay, Escalating Tension, Moral Ambiguity

\textbf{Tone:} Ominous, claustrophobic, and deeply unsettling. Knowledge becomes dangerous, and what seems like scholarly pursuit reveals itself to be a descent into madness.

\textbf{Recommended Character Tier:} Seasoned to Veteran (41-150 XP)

\textbf{Estimated Play Time:} 3 sessions

\section{The University of Thepyrgos - Setting the Scene}

\subsection{What Lies Within These Walls}

The University of Thepyrgos stands as a monument to human knowledge, its towers reaching skyward like fingers grasping for understanding. But within its ancient stones, something has awakened in the spaces between knowledge - perhaps connected to the "General watch" that once seized carts "for the walls." The whispered judgments in Synod Hall are no longer just legal proceedings, but something far more sinister.

The entity feeds on the accumulated fears and secrets of centuries of scholars, students, and seekers who have passed through these halls, making every corridor a potential trap and every book a source of both wisdom and terror.

\subsection{Key Characteristics}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Architectural Horror:} The very building defies logic, with corridors that shift and rooms that are larger within than without.
\item \textbf{Isolation:} Characters are cut off from help within the University complex, making every decision critical.
\item \textbf{Psychological Warfare:} The enemy cannot be easily understood or fought, operating on mental rather than physical levels.
\item \textbf{Escalating Threat:} Fear builds throughout the campaign as the entity grows stronger.
\item \textbf{Moral Complexity:} Survival may require compromising principles and making difficult ethical choices.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Navigating the University}

Navigation in Thepyrgos is not merely about finding one's way through physical spaces, but understanding the psychological landscape of fear and knowledge. The Deck System becomes crucial here, as each draw represents not just a random encounter but a meaningful narrative element that shapes the growing horror.

\section{Key NPCs and Entities}

\subsection{Aqyl, Son of Aqyl}

The Enigmatic Scholar who serves as both guide and potential threat in the depths of academic pursuit.

\begin{monsterentry}{Aqyl, Son of Aqyl}
\textbf{Threat Level:} Major \\
\textbf{Harm:} Varies \\
\textbf{Complication Points:} 2-3 CP per interaction \\
\textbf{Description:} Aqyl appears as a distinguished scholar with deep knowledge of the University's hidden passages and ancient texts. His eyes reflect unusual colors in certain lighting, and he speaks in whispers that carry more than words. \\
\textbf{Motivations:} Maintain the University's secrets while protecting those he cares about \\
\textbf{Abilities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extensive Knowledge: Deep understanding of hidden passages and ancient texts
    \item Whispered Communication: Speaks in whispers that carry supernatural influence
    \item Oath-Bound Wisdom: Cannot easily share certain forbidden knowledge
    \item Partial Influence Resistance: Shows early signs of entity's touch
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Weaknesses:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bound by oaths and knowledge he cannot unlearn
    \item Vulnerable to direct confrontation about his true nature
    \item Becomes confused by absolute statements about reality
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Sample Encounter:} Aqyl offers guidance through the ancient stacks but his whispered advice leads to places that test the PCs' understanding of their own sanity. The GM can spend their CP to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 CP: His guidance reveals useful but disturbing information
    \item 2 CP: He begins to show physical signs of corruption
    \item 3 CP: His whispers contain hidden commands
    \item 4+ CP: He becomes a conduit for the entity's influence
\end{itemize}
\end{monsterentry}

\subsection{Palikar Captain Thorne}

The Reluctant Guardian whose duty conflicts with his growing fear of what lurks within the University walls.

\begin{monsterentry}{Palikar Captain Thorne}
\textbf{Threat Level:} Major \\
\textbf{Harm:} \textgreater \\
\textbf{Complication Points:} 2-3 CP per scene \\
\textbf{Description:} Captain Thorne appears as a weathered military officer with knowledge of tower defenses and patrol routes. He has seen colleagues disappear into the stacks, never to return, and his letter-shyness masks deep paranoia. \\
\textbf{Motivations:} Protect the University from external threats while dealing with internal corruption \\
\textbf{Abilities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tactical Knowledge: Understanding of tower defenses and patrol routes
    \item Military Training: Combat expertise and tactical awareness
    \item Paranoid Awareness: Heightened sense of supernatural danger
    \item Authority Command: Can rally remaining guards and scholars
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Weaknesses:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Letter-shy and reluctant to share information
    \item Becoming increasingly erratic under supernatural pressure
    \item Vulnerable to psychological manipulation
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Sample Encounter:} Captain Thorne approaches the PCs offering protection but his military precision begins to crack under the entity's influence. The GM can spend their CP to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 CP: He reveals knowledge of disappeared colleagues
    \item 2 CP: His paranoia causes him to suspect the PCs
    \item 3 CP: He becomes partially corrupted and hunts the PCs
    \item 4+ CP: He sacrifices himself to buy time for the PCs
\end{itemize}
\end{monsterentry}

\section{Horror Elements and Sanity Mechanics}

\subsection{The Sanity System in Thepyrgos}

The University of Thepyrgos is inherently hostile to the human psyche. The isolation, the unknown threats, and the constant psychological warfare all contribute to a slow erosion of sanity that must be carefully managed.

\begin{mechanic}{Sanity as Resource Management}
Sanity in Thepyrgos is managed through the Boon system. Instead of traditional sanity points, players must spend Boons to prevent the Dread Clock from advancing. This creates a resource management challenge where players must choose between immediate tactical advantages and long-term psychological stability.
\end{mechanic}

\subsection{The Dread Clock}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tableheader}
\textbf{Dread Clock} & \textbf{Psychological deterioration and mounting horror} \\
\hline
Segments & \textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet 0/10 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Advancement Triggers}

\begin{itemize}
\item Discovering scholars' fate: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item Hearing whispers in the dark: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item Seeing shadows move unnaturally: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item Finding evidence of entity's influence: +2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\item Companion shows signs of corruption: +2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\item Direct psychic attack from entity: +3 segments (prevent with 3 Boons)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Psychological Effects by Dread Level}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{0-2 Segments - Unease:} Characters feel on edge, -1 die to social rolls involving trust, minor sleep disturbances
\item \textbf{3-4 Segments - Fear:} -1 die to all rolls when alone, startle easily, avoid dark spaces, nightmares
\item \textbf{5-6 Segments - Terror:} -2 dice to rolls involving courage or rational thought, may flee from non-threatening situations
\item \textbf{7-8 Segments - Madness:} -2 dice to most rolls, may act against own interests, hallucinations, unreliable perception
\item \textbf{9-10 Segments - Broken:} Out of control, may become hostile to allies, permanent psychological damage, requires major intervention to recover
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Locations in Thepyrgos}

\subsection{Synod Hall}

The heart of the University's legal and mystical authority, where judgment is audible at a whisper.

\subsection{The Forbidden Stacks}

Ancient library levels where forbidden knowledge is kept, and where the entity's influence is strongest.

\subsection{The North Tower}

Abandoned tower where the first signs of corruption appeared, serving as a focal point for the entity's influence.

\subsection{The Palikar Barracks}

Guard quarters where the University's protectors have become its prisoners, filled with evidence of disappearances.

\section{Custom Horror Mechanics}

\subsection{The Whispering Mechanic}

When in the ancient towers or stacks of the University, PCs must make Wits + Lore rolls (DV 3) to resist hearing the entity's whispers. Each failure:
\begin{itemize}
\item Generates 1 CP that the GM can spend for psychological effects
\item Advances Dread Clock by 1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item May reveal useful but disturbing information
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Whisper Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item "The books remember your name..."
\item "Knowledge has a price..."
\item "The Matriarch waits for you in Synod Hall..."
\item "Your companion's thoughts are not their own..."
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sacred Geometry Perception}

When PCs observe the ancient architecture of the University, particularly in Synod Hall or the older towers, they must make Wits + Investigation rolls (DV 4) to avoid comprehension effects. Each failure:
\begin{itemize}
\item Generates 2 CP that the GM can spend for reality distortions
\item Advances Dread Clock by 2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\item May grant forbidden knowledge at great psychological cost
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Geometry Manifestations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Corridors that should be straight but bend impossibly
\item Rooms that are larger on the inside than the outside
\item Symbols that shift when not directly observed
\item Stairs that lead to different floors depending on the direction of approach
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Knowledge Corruption}

PCs who reach 7+ Dread segments begin to show physical signs of the entity's influence:
\begin{itemize}
\item Eyes that reflect unusual colors in darkness
\item Speaking in whispers without realizing it
\item Attraction to dark, enclosed spaces like the ancient stacks
\item May be able to communicate with the entity through forbidden knowledge
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Corruption Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
\item +1 die to Lore rolls involving forbidden knowledge
\item -1 die to social rolls due to unsettling presence
\item Can perceive multiple timeline branches (generates 2 CP per scene)
\item Permanent reality distortion (narrative consequence)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Collective Dread}

The party's collective Dread affects their perception of the University:
\begin{itemize}
\item Average Dread level determines reality stability
\item High average = shared hallucinations, impossible events become real
\item Low average = grounding effect, some resistance to cosmic influence
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Collective Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Shared visions of the entity's true form
\item Impossible architectural changes that affect all PCs
\item Collective memory gaps about recent events
\item Enhanced group paranoia and infighting
\end{itemize}

\section{Campaign Clocks}

\subsection{Entity's Awakening Clock (12 segments)}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tableheader}
\textbf{Entity's Awakening Clock} & \textbf{Progress toward the collective consciousness of forbidden knowledge being fully disturbed} \\
\hline
Segments & \textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet 0/12 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Advancement Triggers:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Forbidden texts read: +1 segment per major tome
\item Ancient secrets uncovered: +2 segments
\item Synod Hall judgment heard: +1 segment
\item Knowledge used for dark purposes: +2 segments
\item PCs delve deeper into forbidden stacks: +1 segment per session
\item PCs interfere with awakening: +2 segments
\item Ancient binding ritual discovered: -1 segment
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Town Collapse Clock (8 segments)}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tableheader}
\textbf{Town Collapse Clock} & \textbf{How quickly the University community breaks down under supernatural pressure} \\
\hline
Segments & \textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet 0/8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{itemize}

\section{Resolution Paths}

\subsection{The Sacrifice}

Permanently seal the entity using ancient techniques, but it requires one PC to remain behind as a living anchor.
\begin{itemize}
\item Success means the entity is contained, but at great personal cost
\item Award 15-18 XP
\item The sacrificed PC becomes a guardian spirit, occasionally communicating through whispers
\item The University remains but is forever changed - some areas are permanently sealed
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Escape}

Flee with evidence of the threat, warning other settlements. The entity remains but is contained for now.
\begin{itemize}
\item Award 10-12 XP
\item Create ongoing campaign thread
\item The University becomes a quarantined zone
\item The entity's influence spreads slowly to neighboring regions
\item PCs become hunted by those who want to suppress the truth
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Corruption}

Allow the entity to partially manifest, gaining its power but becoming its servants.
\begin{itemize}
\item Transform PCs into agents of horror
\item Award 8-10 XP but fundamentally change character nature
\item PCs gain supernatural abilities but lose humanity
\item They become extensions of the entity's will
\item The University becomes a hub for the entity's expansion
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Investigation}

Fully understand the entity and find a way to banish it without sacrifice.
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires significant research and resources
\item Award 18-20 XP if successful, but very difficult
\item Must gather knowledge from multiple forbidden texts
\item Requires cooperation with corrupted NPCs
\item Success permanently seals the entity but weakens the fabric of reality in the area
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Bargain}

Negotiate with the entity to limit its influence in exchange for specific concessions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Award 12-15 XP with ongoing supernatural responsibilities
\item The entity agrees to limit its feeding in exchange for periodic offerings
\item PCs become mediators between the entity and the living
\item The University becomes a neutral ground for otherworldly negotiations
\item Creates potential for future conflicts when the bargain is tested
\end{itemize}

\section{Using the Deck System}

\subsection{Drawing from Thepyrgos Deck}

The Deck System provides rich narrative content for encounters within the University. Each draw should feel meaningful and contribute to the overall atmosphere of paranoia and unknown threats.

\item Architecture shifts to trap or harm PCs
\item Corrupted scholars become hostile
\item Ancient defenses activate against intruders
\item Reality distortions cause physical injury
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Clubs - Resource Depletion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Essential supplies become contaminated
\item Communication with outside world is cut off
\item Magical or technological aids malfunction

\begin{itemize}
\item Forbidden knowledge reveals itself unexpectedly
\item The entity manifests partially in the physical world
\item Ancient wards begin to fail
\item Reality itself becomes unstable
\item Supernatural entities from other dimensions take notice
\end{itemize}

\section{GM Tips and Advice}

\subsection{Atmosphere and Tension}

Building Dread:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use lighting, sound, and physical environment to create unease
\item Describe sensations and feelings, not just visual details
\item Let silences and pauses carry weight
\item Make the familiar seem alien and threatening
\end{itemize}

Pacing the Horror:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start subtle and build gradually
\item Vary the intensity - allow moments of false security
\item Use foreshadowing and ominous signs
\item Save the biggest revelations for climactic moments
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Managing Fear and Sanity}

Fear as a Resource:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fear should be a narrative driver, not a punishment
\item Let players feel powerful even when afraid
\item Provide opportunities to confront and overcome fears
\item Balance terror with moments of triumph
\end{itemize}

Sanity Management:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make sanity loss feel meaningful and personal
\item Let it change how characters perceive and interact with the world
\item Provide ways to recover or adapt to mental trauma
\item Avoid making characters useless when sanity is low
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Narrative Techniques}

Player Agency:
\begin{itemize}
\item Give players meaningful choices, even when options seem limited
\item Let their decisions have real consequences
\item Provide multiple approaches to problems
\item Respect their courage to face the horror head-on
\end{itemize}

Unreliable Information:
\begin{itemize}
\item Not all sources are trustworthy
\item Clues may be misleading or incomplete
\item NPCs might be lying, mistaken, or hiding crucial information
\item Let players discover the truth through investigation and deduction
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

"Whispers in the Stacks" is designed to challenge your players not just physically, but psychologically and morally. The horror lies not in gore or jump scares, but in the slow erosion of certainty and the terrifying realization that knowledge itself can be a curse.

Remember that the best horror comes from what is left unsaid and unseen. Let the players' imaginations fill in the gaps, and trust in the power of implication over explicit description. The fear of what might be lurking in the shadows is often more effective than showing every monster in detail.

Most importantly, maintain communication with your players about comfort levels and boundaries. Horror can be deeply personal, and what one player finds thrilling, another might find genuinely distressing. A good horror game is one where everyone at the table is having fun and feeling appropriately challenged, not traumatized.

The mechanics provided here are tools to enhance the horror experience, not replace good storytelling and atmosphere. Use them to support your narrative goals and create memorable, chilling experiences for your players.

As the GM, you hold the quill that writes the legend, but it is the players who create the story. Guide them through the stacks of Thepyrgos, challenge their perceptions, and let them emerge changed by their journey - for better or for worse.

\begin{center}
\textbf{In the spaces between knowledge, in the whispers of the stacks, and in the judgments of Synod Hall, the truth waits patiently. Will you listen? Will you pay the price? Will you survive to tell the tale?}
\end{center}

The University of Thepyrgos thanks you for your service. Please return all forbidden texts to the proper authorities. Knowledge is a responsibility, not a right.

May your dice roll true, your choices be meaningful, and your players emerge from the stacks forever changed.
