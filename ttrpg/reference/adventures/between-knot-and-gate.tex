\vspace{-1.25em}

\noindent\textbf{Primary Patrons:} Morag the Hag, The Pale Shepherd.\\
\textbf{Pitch:} A borderland duchy's pilgrimage gate---once guiding the dead to rest---is failing. Restless souls linger. Morag offers order through cruel bargains; the Pale Shepherd urges restoration and right endings. The party must decide what replaces the old order.

\section*{GM Quick Sheet (At-the-Table Flow)}
\textbf{Hook.} A noble heir returns memoryless from a failed funeral procession; hauntings begin.\\
\textbf{Immediate Offers.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Morag's Envoy:} Bind the duchy with thorned bargains for fast stability (deep cost).
  \item \textbf{Shepherd's Acolyte:} Restore the threshold gate through vigil, memory, and covenant (slow, compassionate).
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Global Clocks.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Stalled Passing} \clock{6} (dead linger; hauntings escalate).
  \item \textbf{Bargain Net Tightens} \clock{6} (oaths spread across civic life).
  \item \textbf{Gate Repair or Replacement} \clock{8} (relics, name, covenant).
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Hard Triggers.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Morag Obligation 10+:} Demand betrayal/sacrifice; refusal invites hexed interference.
  \item \textbf{Shepherd Obligation 9+:} Task to shepherd a specific lost soul; stalling worsens social Position for related scenes.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Act I --- Frayed Thresholds}
\textbf{Goals:} Learn causes, choose initial allegiance(s), expose stakes.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Broken Procession.} Escort a funeral that fails at the old gate; lost souls manifest.\\
  Tests: Wits+Insight (oath residue), Spirit+Rites (soothe), Deception/Command (calm crowds).
  \item \textbf{Two Offers, One Cost.} Morag's agent pitches a \textit{Rite of the Thorned Bargain} for peace; the Shepherd's acolyte urges a \textit{Rite of the Memory Corral} to learn why the gate fails.
  \item \textbf{Crossroads Lead.} Use \textit{Rite of the Crossroads Whisper} to pick a path: investigate the \emph{Oath-Ledgers} (Morag) or the \emph{Buried Doorframe} (Shepherd).
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Starter Clocks.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Public Panic} \clock{4} (feeds other clocks).
  \item \textbf{Hidden Oath Cartel} \clock{6} (guild + magistrates).
  \item \textbf{Gate's Old Name Remembered} \clock{4} (Shepherd-leaning discovery).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Act II --- The Knot Tightens, The Gate Groans}
\textbf{Goals:} Unravel causes; choose methods of resolution. \emph{Run 2--3 threads.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Oath Cartel.} Syndicate monetizes funerals via \textit{Rite of the Twisted Knot}.\\
  Scenes: ledger heist; \textit{Bone-Truth} interrogation; courtroom challenge under thorned bargain.
  \item \textbf{The Stolen Doorframe.} Relic from the first gate sits as d√©cor, steeped in grief.\\
  Scenes: social infiltration (\textit{Borrowed Face}); ballroom \textit{Memory Corral}; \textit{Threshold Covenant} with the family.
  \item \textbf{The Lost Heir's Memory.} Missing memory holds the true keeper's name.\\
  Scenes: dream vigil (\textit{Gentle Passing} on the dying tutor); \textit{Shadow Flock} crypt traversal; Resolve to accept painful truth.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Mid-Act Set Pieces.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Market of Masks.} Morag's fair-night; cheap bargains solve symptoms (temptation).
  \item \textbf{Vigil of Stillness.} Shepherd rite stabilizes a district for one night; costs Fatigue/Obligation.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Evolving Clocks.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Bargain Net Tightens} \clock{6$\to$8} if bargains are used for civic order.
  \item \textbf{Gate Repair or Replacement} \clock{8} ticks with relics, name, and covenant.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Reveals.} The keeper line is broken; the Cartel plugged the gap with profit-driven oaths. The relics (burned doorframe, water blessed by loss, the keeper's name) can re-bind the threshold.

\section*{Act III --- Binding or Passing}
\textbf{Goals:} Choose a lasting settlement for the duchy.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Bind the City (Morag).} Enact a mass \textit{Thorned Bargain}: safety for obedience.\\
  Boss-as-System: Institutional bureaucracy (oath office) + Social movement (pro/anti-bargain).
  \item \textbf{Restore the Gate (Shepherd).} Perform \textit{Threshold Covenant} with a rightful keeper and community.\\
  Requires relics, public vigil, and accepting the cost (harm/condition/community burden).
  \item \textbf{Hybrid Third Way.} Limited time-boxed bargains to protect the weak, with sunset clauses after restoration; public oversight.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Final Confrontations (Non-Combat Bosses).}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Court of Oaths.} Debate, precedent, and ritual law determine civic order.
  \item \textbf{Funeral March.} Escort hundreds through the threshold; manage hazards, panic, predatory deals.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Failure States.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gate collapses: \textbf{Stalled Passing} \clock{6$\to$10}; duchy becomes a liminal haunt.
  \item Oath-martial law: Bargain Net locks in; dissenters cursed or exiled.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Rewards \& Consequences}
\textbf{Morag Path.} Access to \textit{Cauldron's Boil} components; political leverage. Costs: Obligation spikes; risk \textbf{Bargain-Sight}; trust erosion.\\
\textbf{Shepherd Path.} One-use blessing akin to \textit{Shepherd's Mercy}; ``Good Death'' favors; safer funerary narratives. Costs: community burden, \textbf{Melancholy} risk, personal sacrifice clock.\\
\textbf{Hybrid.} Civic legitimacy; partial favor from both patrons; recurring auditors (Silent Collector / Acolyte).

\section*{Location Seeds}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Splintered Gate.} Ruined arch; candle-flames gutter upward; names whisper.
  \item \textbf{The Ledger Hall.} Thorn-carved lecterns; quills drink blood; oaths echo.
  \item \textbf{The Wakehouse.} Woven veils; memories condense like dew on glass.
  \item \textbf{The Manor of Borrowed Faces.} Portrait gallery that watches back.
  \item \textbf{The Crossroads Well.} Mouth-stones for whispers; offerings tied with knots.
\end{itemize}

\section*{NPCs (Quick Roles)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Archivist Avena (Shepherd-leaning).} Seeks honest endings; knows the old name.
  \item \textbf{Magistrate Thorn (Morag-leaning).} Efficient tyrant by paperwork; believes bargains are mercy.
  \item \textbf{Heir Lysa (Center).} Missing memory; potential threshold keeper.
  \item \textbf{Kettle-Mae (Morag's Envoy).} Charming; cruel when crossed.
  \item \textbf{Brother Tellen (Shepherd's Acolyte).} Exhausted; stubbornly kind.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Clocks \& Dials (Suggested Defaults)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Stalled Passing} \clock{6} (advances on public fear, failed vigils).
  \item \textbf{Bargain Net Tightens} \clock{6}/\clock{8} (advances when bargains maintain order).
  \item \textbf{Gate Repair or Replacement} \clock{8} (ticks with relics, name, covenant).
  \item \textbf{Public Panic} \clock{4} (feeds others).
  \item \textbf{Hidden Oath Cartel} \clock{6} (expose or dismantle).
  \item \textbf{Vigil of Stillness} \clock{4} (hold the line during rites).
\end{itemize}

\section*{SB Spend Menu (Thematic)}
\textbf{1 SB.} Contract snag; a mourner names a taboo; helpful memory shard stings.\\
\textbf{2 SB.} Oath loophole closes; vigil interrupted by a familiar face (\textit{Borrowed Face}); lost soul fixates on a PC.\\
\textbf{3 SB.} Spiteful curse (Harm 1--2); riot at the wake; false keeper declared.\\
\textbf{4+ SB.} Mass panic; oath purge; threshold backlash (zone-wide Stress/Fatigue).

\section*{Obligation Triggers (Foreground)}
\textbf{Morag 10+.} Demand betrayal/sacrifice; refusal invites manipulation and curses.\\
\textbf{Morag 12+.} Promises misfire; transformations backfire; pariah risk until a proving-quest.\\
\textbf{Shepherd 9+.} Shepherd a specific soul/memory; delaying worsens social Position.\\
\textbf{Shepherd 11+.} Threshold flicker: doors mislead to the Ways Between until penitent quest.

\section*{Resolution Epilogues (Pick a Tone)}
\textbf{Order at a Price.} Markets calm; funerals function; love grows cold.\\
\textbf{Mercy with Scars.} Hauntings end; grief honored; quiet burdens borne.\\
\textbf{Precarious Balance.} Civic oaths sunset; the gate tends itself---until next winter.

\section{Patron Entry: The Pale Shepherd}
\label{patron:pale-shepherd}

\subsection*{Lore}
The Pale Shepherd is the guardian of thresholds, the watcher at the crossroads between life and death, sleep and waking, the mortal world and the Ways Between. Neither wholly benevolent nor malevolent, the Shepherd tends to the lost, the dying, and those who have wandered too far from their destined path. They appear as a figure in pale, weathered robes, often accompanied by a flock of shadow-sheep whose wool holds fragments of forgotten dreams and lost memories.  

The Shepherd speaks rarely, and when they do, their words are riddles that seem to answer questions not yet asked. They are invoked by those who seek guidance through liminal spaces, protection for the dying, or the recovery of lost things---though the Shepherd's help often comes with the price of a memory or a piece of one's future. Their sigil is a white ram's skull wreathed in mist.  

Those who serve the Pale Shepherd learn to navigate the spaces between states, to find paths where none seem to exist, and to shepherd others through their own dark nights. However, prolonged service renders the faithful melancholic, as they become attuned to the sorrow and loss that permeate all transitions.

\subsection*{Patron's Gift (Imbuement)}
Once per scene as an action (cost: 1 Boon; requires Thiasos), touch an item to imbue it until scene end with +1 Melee and +1 Stealth or Insight (when leveraging liminal spaces/transition moments) (Thematic). \emph{Push It:} extend for one extra scene by marking +1 Obligation.

\emph{Push It:} The path becomes supernaturally clear for one scene, but generate 1 SB (Clubs) as liminal forces take notice.

\subsection*{Standard Rites}
\paragraph{Rite of the Shadow Flock [PASSAGE][VEIL].} Duration: Scene; Range: Near.

\subsection*{Obligation}
Starts at 5 for Tier II characters, scaling with tier.

\subsection*{Rivalries}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ikasha (Shadow, Latent Potential):} Subtle friction---Ikasha tends to hidden paths, the Shepherd to endings.
  \item \textbf{The Traveler (Ways \& Roads):} Obvious antagonism---the Traveler opens paths, the Shepherd closes them.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hard Obligation Triggers (Module-Specific)}
\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Obligation 11+:} Connection to liminal spaces destabilizes. Doors may open to the Ways Between, and you risk becoming lost. Requires a quest to restore balance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Melancholy (Persistent Condition)}

Effect: -1 die to social rolls involving joy or levity, but +1 die to rolls involving comfort, guidance, vigils, or liminal spaces.  
Narrative: A constant reminder of mortality and transition; characters become somber but insightful about endings.

\section{Patron Entry: Morag the Hag}
\label{patron:morag}

\subsection*{Lore}
Morag dwells at the edges of things---crossroads, shorelines, the borders between cultivated land and wild wood. She is ancient beyond measure, her form shifting between that of a wizened crone, a terrible maiden, and a creature of shadows and bone. Her voice carries the weight of countless bargains made and broken, and her laughter echoes with children's tears.  

Morag is the patron of those who seek power through cunning, transformation, and the manipulation of weakness. She offers gifts with hidden curses, teaches transformations that exact a price, and grants knowledge that burns the unworthy. Her realm is perpetual twilight, where hospitality is sacred law and breaking a promise carries penalties worse than death. Her sigil is a twisted knot that shifts between a heart and a noose.  

Those who bargain with Morag gain the ability to see hidden truths, twist fate, and transform themselves or others---but each gift deepens their entanglement in her web of obligations and curses.

\subsection*{Patron's Gift (Imbuement)}

Invoke: 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.  
\emph{Push It:} Breaking causes Harm 1 (Curse) and permanent ``Broken Promise'' Condition; mark 1 SB (Diamonds).  

\paragraph{Rite of the Borrowed Face (Low).} Duration: Scene; Range: Self.  
Materials: a hawthorn mask or convincing portrait.  
Effect: Assume the appearance of someone you know. Gain +2 dice to Deception to impersonate, but cannot mimic memories or mannerisms perfectly. Close acquaintances may test Insight (DV 3).  
Invoke: 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.  
\emph{Push It:} Disguise is perfect, but the person suffers 1 Fatigue, and you may too (Resolve DV 2). Generate 1 SB (Spades).

\subsection*{Standard Rites}
\paragraph{Rite of the Thorned Bargain [OATH][CURSE].} Duration: Extended; Range: Near.  
Materials: blood from each party mixed with thorn-juice over fire.

Invoke: Extended ritual; mark +1 Obligation.  
\emph{Push It:} Bargain becomes self-enforcing, cruel, and inescapable. Mark +1 Obligation and 1 SB (Clubs).  

\paragraph{Rite of the Bone-Truth [REVEAL][BIND].} Duration: Scene; Range: Near.

\paragraph{Rite of the Cauldron's Boil [TRANSFORM][UNWARD].} Duration: Extended; Range: Zone.  
Materials: a cauldron, symbolic ingredients, and a ``price.''  
Effect: Major transformation: alter a person, location, or magical effect. Permanent, with a price.  
Invoke: Extended ritual; mark +3 Obligation.  
\emph{Push It:} Transformation is perfect but consequences shift elsewhere, or new problems arise. Mark +2 Obligation and start a clock.

\subsection*{Obligation}
Starts at 6 for Tier II characters, scaling with tier. Morag‚Äôs obligations are sticky and personal.

\subsection*{Rivalries}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Livaea (Temptation, Desire):} Tension---both manipulate desire, but Livaea tempts, Morag bargains.  
  \item \textbf{Aliyah (Curses \& Corruption):} Antagonism---Aliyah corrupts, Morag exacts payment.  
  \item \textbf{Maelstraeus (Infernal Bargainer):} Opposition---Maelstraeus builds webs, Morag leaves one diminished.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hard Obligation Triggers}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Obligation 10+:} Morag appears to collect: demand betrayal, sacrifice, or corruption of someone close. Refusal means she turns against you through manipulation and curses.  
  \item \textbf{Obligation 12+:} Promises misfire, transformations backfire, and others distrust you. Requires a quest to prove worth or risk pariah status.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Bargain-Sight (Persistent Condition)}
Bonding deeply with Morag grants \textbf{Bargain-Sight}.  
Effect: +2 Insight to detect deception or hidden costs. Always see the price of deals, creating paranoia.  
Narrative: Excellent negotiator, but cynical and mistrustful; struggles with genuine bonds.
\clearpage

\subsection{The Inquisitor Prime}
\label{patron:inquisitor-prime}

\paragraph{Lore.}
The Inquisitor Prime is the embodiment of righteous persecution and methodical destruction of the arcane. Neither god nor demon, but a conceptual force born from centuries of witch-hunting. They appear as a figure in pristine white armor stained with the ash of burned spellbooks, their face hidden behind a helm that shifts symbols depending on the viewer's faith.

The Inquisitor values precision over brutality, knowledge over zealotry. Followers are methodical hunters who understand their prey. They gain protection from magical influence, clarity to pierce illusions, and weapons that cut through supernatural defenses. Prolonged service, however, strips away nuance, leaving only intolerance for ambiguity.

Their sigil is a white flame that burns without fuel --- the pure destruction of corruption.

\paragraph{Patron's Gift (Imbuement).}
Once per scene as an action (cost: 1 Boon; requires \emph{Thiasos}), touch an item to imbue it until scene end with \textbf{+1 Melee} and \textbf{+1 Arcana or Insight} (when combating supernatural threats).

\subsection{Noctira, the Veil of Midnight (Dreams \& Shadows)}

\paragraph{Lore.}
Noctira is the whisper beneath the bed and the flutter of curtains in a still room. She is the half-remembered lullaby sung by the dead, the cold weight on your chest when you cannot move. Her dominion is not over terror itself, but over the boundary between waking and nightmare. Those who follow her learn to weave shadow and dream into both weapon and refuge. Her gifts are seductive: protection in the dark, mastery of dreams, but each step taken draws the supplicant deeper into sleepless nights and hollow-eyed visions.

\paragraph{Patron‚Äôs Gift (Imbuement).}

\textbf{Rite of the Black Lantern [WARD][FOLLOW-UP]} ‚Äî \emph{Extended; Zone; Materials: A lantern fueled by your blood.}  
Consecrate a location in shadow. Within, you and allies gain +2 dice vs. supernatural fear. Intruders generate +2 SB when attempting to resist dread. Push It: The lantern‚Äôs light shows false paths‚Äîanyone leaving must resist or become lost in looping halls (advance Location Corruption Clock by 2).

\paragraph{Obligation.}
At 9+: Sleepless visions. You see monsters that may not exist, suffering -1 die to social rolls but +1 die against supernatural foes.  
At 11+: Permanent Condition ‚Äî \textbf{Hollow-eyed Dreamer}: You exist half in nightmare, suffering -2 dice on mundane tasks but immune to mundane fear.

\section{Haunted House --- ``Midnight Rooms and Shadowed Halls''}
\label{chap:haunted-house}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
A haunted house is not merely a place, but a memory made architecture. Its walls bleed with old bargains, its halls echo with unfinished prayers, and its staircases creak under the weight of forgotten sins. To step inside is to invite the midnight in, and once you do, it will know your name.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Room/Presence/Manifestation)} A hall lined with portraits whose eyes weep brine; a nursery where toys whisper lullabies; a cellar stair that descends farther every night.

\section*{Spades --- Structure \& Rooms}
\label{sec:haunted-house-rooms}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item \textbf{Creaking Hallway} --- Doors never lead to the same place twice.
\item \textbf{Mirror Gallery} --- Reflections move out of sync, sometimes speak.
\item \textbf{Nursery} --- Toys whisper secrets, lullabies warp into screams.
\item \textbf{Ballroom} --- Chandeliers sway to unheard music, floor remembers every dance.
\item \textbf{Library} --- Books rearrange themselves; reading out loud advances clocks.
\item \textbf{Dining Room} --- Feast always set, food rots when touched.
\item \textbf{Cellar Stairs} --- Descend farther each night; bottom never the same.
\item \textbf{Chapel} --- Icons weep blood or saltwater; air tastes of incense.
\item \textbf{Attic} --- Trunks whisper, dolls shift when unlit.
\item[J] \textbf{Garden Court} --- Overgrown vines strangle statuary; paths lead nowhere.
\item[Q] \textbf{Master‚Äôs Bedroom} --- Bed still warm; mirror shows stranger watching.
\item[K] \textbf{Basement Door} --- Locked, nailed, chained; something knocks back.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:haunted-house-quick}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = room, Heart = resident, Club = complication, Diamond = revelation. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified resolutions (graves, contracts, bargains) that shift position instead of calling for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{house-heart} motifs --- pulsing walls, sentient architecture, bargains offered directly by Noctira.
\end{itemize}
