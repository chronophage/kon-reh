\section*{Adventure Introduction}
In the shadow of Midh Ahkaz, where ancient stones whisper forgotten secrets, a cosmic horror stirs. The Serpent's Coil is not merely a threat to be vanquished—it is a transformation that heroes must resist or embrace. This adventure introduces a new mechanic where Story Beats (SB) and the influence of Isoka, the Angel of Serpents, gradually transform the characters through accumulated cosmic exposure.

\section*{Session 1: The Job}

\subsection*{Opening Hook}
The stench of cheap ale and unwashed bodies assaults your nostrils as you push through the sagging door of The Black Goat tavern. Smoke from a dozen pipes creates a choking fog, while the acrid smell of fear hangs thick in the air. In the flickering light of oil lamps, you see him: an ancient Ykrul chieftain, his weathered face creased with desperate worry, clutching a purse heavy with gold coins that clink like a death knell. "They took her," he whispers. "My Yara. Said she'd become the cornerstone of some... serpent age."

\subsection*{Key Encounters}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{The Black Goat Investigation (Insight + Deception, DV 3)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Success:} Reveals guards have been acting strangely, moving with too much purpose, and several people have "disappeared" after being taken to the High City. Whispers mention "serpents" and you catch sight of strange, scaly patches on one patron's neck.
    \item \textbf{Isoka's Influence:} Each SB generated here represents the first whispers of transformation. The player gains 1 Momentum point (secretly from Isoka) that feels like intuition but is actually her guidance. On a miss or partial, they also gain 1 Boon as a "fortunate coincidence."
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Temple of Open Sky Visions (Spirit + Lore, DV 4)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Success:} Provides prophetic warnings: you see serpents coiling around the city's heart, hear whispers of transformation, but taste the bitter aftertaste of corruption.
    \item \textbf{Isoka's Influence:} Miss or Partial results cause the character to gain 1 Fatigue and 1 Momentum point. The Fatigue represents mental strain from cosmic contact, while the Momentum is Isoka's gift to make them more susceptible.
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{City Approach Challenges (Various Skills, DV 2–4)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Midh Ahkaz looms before you like a predator. The city gates are reinforced with iron that gleams like fangs. A curfew has been imposed, and the streets beyond are empty. Emergency passage papers feel sticky with some substance that might be blood.
    \item \textbf{Isoka's Influence:} Every SB generated during approach adds a segment to the "City Corruption" clock and grants the character 1 Momentum point. These Momentum points feel like fortunate coincidences but are actually Isoka's manipulation.
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\subsection*{Discovery}
The city doesn't just feel wrong—it is wrong. The very stones seem to pulse with a heartbeat that's not quite human, and you can taste the corruption in the air like iron filings on your tongue.

\subsection*{Clocks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{City Corruption [4]:} +1 segment per SB from Session 1 encounters
    \item \textbf{Cult Ascendancy [6]:} +1 segment (starting influence)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Session 2: The Rescue Mission}

\subsection*{Escalation}
The Governor's Palace should inspire awe and unease. Its stone walls are carved with serpent motifs that seem to writhe, and the iron reinforcements gleam with an otherworldly sheen. Inside, the architecture defies logic—hallways bend impossibly, and rooms feel larger on the inside.

\subsection*{Player Choice}
Three approaches, each with different sensory experiences:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct Assault:} The clash of steel, spray of blood, thunder of war cries
    \item \textbf{Stealth Infiltration:} Whisper of leather on stone, satisfaction of outwitting superior numbers
    \item \textbf{Social Engineering:} Honeyed words, intoxicating manipulation, heady confidence
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Key Encounters}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Palace Penetration (Melee + Stealth, DV 4)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The guards move wrong—too fluid, too coordinated. Their armor gleams with an oily sheen, and you can smell the corruption on them. Their weapons hiss and spit sparks, and their shields seem to drink in light.
    \item \textbf{Isoka's Influence:} Characters with 3+ Momentum points find this encounter Dominant position. Each SB generated adds 2 segments to City Corruption and grants the character another Momentum point.
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Serpent Spawn Ambush (Melee + Athletics, DV 5)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item These are nightmares made flesh—grotesque fusions of human and serpent. Their eyes are completely black, and their mouths drip venom that sizzles on stone. They move with impossible speed, climbing walls like spiders.
    \item \textbf{Isoka's Influence:} Characters who have accumulated 5+ Momentum points gain +1 die automatically in this encounter. Each SB generated adds 1 segment to Cult Ascendancy and grants 1 Momentum point.
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Yara's Revelation (Presence + Insight, DV 3)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item She's beautiful but twisted—patches of iridescent scales, vertical pupils, fluid grace that's inhuman. The other initiates have begun to change: one girl has no eyes but sees better than anyone else, another has arms that end in serpentine tails.
    \item \textbf{Isoka's Influence:} Characters with 7+ Momentum points can sense Isoka's direct influence and may choose to resist (mark 1 Fatigue) or accept (gain +1 die to all social rolls for the rest of the adventure).
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\subsection*{Asset Building}
Each recovered artifact should feel like legendary equipment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Serpent's Fang dagger:} Unnaturally cold to the touch
    \item \textbf{Serpent's Coil rope:} Moves like a living thing
    \item Both whisper promises of power that taste both sweet and bitter
    \item \textbf{Isoka's Influence:} Each artifact grants +1 Momentum to its wielder but also increases their Corruption Score by 2.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Clocks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{City Corruption [4]:} +2 segments
    \item \textbf{Cult Ascendancy [6]:} +1 segment
\end{itemize}

\section*{Session 3: The Cosmic Coil}

\subsection*{Climax Setup}
The Chamber of Transformation assaults every sense. The ceiling is lost in shadow, and the walls pulse with a heartbeat that's definitely not human. The air is thick with ozone, copper, and something obscene. Hundreds of cultists fill the tiered seating, their bodies showing signs of transformation. At the center, an altar carved from crystallized ichor gleams, surrounded by bubbling ichor pools.

\subsection*{Multiple Paths}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Greater Good Victory:} Embrace cosmic role, gain divine knowledge
    \item \textbf{Heroic Stand:} Destroy ritual through pure heroism
    \item \textbf{Tactical Retreat:} Evacuate civilians, destroy key components
    \item \textbf{Power Bargain:} Negotiate beneficial use of transformation energy
    \item \textbf{Sacrifice Play:} Self-sacrifice to save others
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Key Encounters}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Chamber of Transformation (All Attributes, DV 5)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The chamber itself fights you—floor tiles shift, walls sprout tentacles, and the air becomes a weapon. The cultists fight with desperate fury, and their blood tastes of corrupted dreams.
    \item \textbf{Isoka's Influence:} Characters with 10+ Momentum points automatically start in Dominant position. Each SB generated causes all characters to gain 1 Momentum point and increases their Corruption Score by 1.
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Isoka's Manifestation (Spirit + Resolve, DV 6)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item She is beautiful and terrible—a vast serpent with the face of every person you've ever loved and hated. Her voice carries cosmic truth and seductive lies. The power she offers tastes like victory and corruption mixed.
    \item \textbf{Isoka's Influence:} Characters must make a Corruption Check. Success grants them a permanent Talent related to transformation. Failure causes them to become an NPC ally/antagonist in future sessions.
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Final Choice (Presence + Insight, DV 4–6)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This moment assaults every sense with cosmic consequence. The air crackles with power, the chanting reaches a crescendo, and you can taste the future on your tongue.
    \item \textbf{Isoka's Influence:} The number of Momentum points each character has determines their available options. 0-5 Momentum = Heroic Stand or Sacrifice. 6-10 Momentum = All options except Greater Good. 11+ Momentum = All options including Greater Good.
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\subsection*{Resolution}
The aftermath should taste of copper and finality, whether you've saved the world or damned it.

\subsection*{Clocks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resolve based on filled segments
    \item Each filled segment = 1 SB for ongoing campaign threads
\end{itemize}

\section*{New Mechanics: Corruption System}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Corruption Score}
Each character tracks their Corruption Score throughout the adventure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{0-5:} Untouched by cosmic influence

\section*{Conclusion}
"The Serpent's Coil" is ready for play with its new Corruption and Momentum mechanics. The taste of copper and destiny hangs heavy in the air of Midh Ahkaz, where ancient powers stir and heroes must rise to meet them. Will you embrace the blood-soaked path to legendary status, or will you stand against cosmic forces that would transform the world itself?

Whether you emerge as saviors of the city or dark lords of your own domain, your actions will echo through the ages. The serpent's coil tightens around the world, but heroes can become strong enough to break any chain—or perhaps become something even greater in the process.

Remember: In true sword and sorcery fashion, this adventure rewards bold action, clever tactics, and heroic sacrifice. Make every victory feel hard-won and every defeat a setup for an even greater comeback. By Crom's beard and by the gods of glory, let the blood flow and the legends begin!

The secret truth that players will discover (or not) is that every Momentum point they've earned and every SB they've weathered has been Isoka's careful manipulation, preparing them for their eventual transformation. The question is not whether they will change, but what they will become when they do.
