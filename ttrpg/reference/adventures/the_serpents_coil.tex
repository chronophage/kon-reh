\section*{Adventure Overview}
\textbf{Sessions}: 3\\
\textbf{Theme}: Sword \& sorcery horror with rising legendary status\\
\textbf{Core Innovation}: Heroes become increasingly formidable as they confront cosmic horror

\section{Session 1: The Job}

\subsection*{Opening Hook}
The stench of cheap ale and unwashed bodies assaults your nostrils as you push through the sagging door of \textit{The Black Goat} tavern. Smoke from a dozen pipes creates a choking fog, while the acrid smell of fear hangs thick in the air. In the flickering light of oil lamps, you see him: an ancient Ykrul chieftain, his weathered face creased with desperate worry, clutching a purse heavy with gold coins that clink like a death knell. \textit{“They took her,”} he whispers. \textit{“My Yara. Said she'd become the cornerstone of some... serpent age.”}

\subsection*{Key Encounters}

\textbf{The Black Goat Investigation} (Insight + Deception, DV 3)\\
Success reveals that guards have been acting strangely, moving with too much purpose, and several people have “disappeared” after being taken to the High City. The whispers mention “serpents” and you catch sight of strange, scaly patches on one patron’s neck.

\textbf{Temple of Open Sky Visions} (Spirit + Lore, DV 4)\\
The temple should be peaceful, but the air tastes wrong—like copper and ozone. Success provides prophetic warnings: you see serpents coiling around the city’s heart, hear whispers of transformation, but taste the bitter aftertaste of corruption.

\textbf{City Approach Challenges} (Various Skills, DV 2–4)\\
Midh Ahkaz looms before you like a predator. The city gates are reinforced with iron that gleams like fangs. A curfew has been imposed, and the streets beyond are empty. Emergency passage papers feel sticky with some substance that might be blood.

\subsection*{Discovery}
The city doesn't just feel wrong—it is wrong. The very stones seem to pulse with a heartbeat that's not quite human, and you can taste the corruption in the air like iron filings on your tongue.

\subsection*{Clocks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item City Corruption [4]: 1 segment
    \item Cult Ascendancy [6]: 1 segment
\end{itemize}

\section{Session 2: The Rescue Mission}

\subsection*{Escalation}
The Governor's Palace should inspire awe and unease. Its stone walls are carved with serpent motifs that seem to writhe, and the iron reinforcements gleam with an otherworldly sheen. Inside, the architecture defies logic—hallways bend impossibly, and rooms feel larger on the inside.

\subsection*{Player Choice}
Three approaches, each with different sensory experiences:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct Assault}: The clash of steel, spray of blood, thunder of war cries
    \item \textbf{Stealth Infiltration}: Whisper of leather on stone, satisfaction of outwitting superior numbers
    \item \textbf{Social Engineering}: Honeyed words, intoxicating manipulation, heady confidence
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Key Encounters}

\textbf{Palace Penetration} (Melee + Stealth, DV 4)\\
The guards move wrong—too fluid, too coordinated. Their armor gleams with an oily sheen, and you can smell the corruption on them. Their weapons hiss and spit sparks, and their shields seem to drink in light.

\textbf{Serpent Spawn Ambush} (Melee + Athletics, DV 5)\\
These are nightmares made flesh—grotesque fusions of human and serpent. Their eyes are completely black, and their mouths drip venom that sizzles on stone. They move with impossible speed, climbing walls like spiders.

\textbf{Yara's Revelation} (Presence + Insight, DV 3)\\
She's beautiful but twisted—patches of iridescent scales, vertical pupils, fluid grace that's inhuman. The other initiates have begun to change: one girl has no eyes but sees better than anyone else, another has arms that end in serpentine tails.

\subsection*{Asset Building}
Each recovered artifact should feel like legendary equipment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Serpent's Fang} dagger: Unnaturally cold to the touch
    \item \textbf{Serpent's Coil} rope: Moves like a living thing
    \item Both whisper promises of power that taste both sweet and bitter
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Clocks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item City Corruption [4]: +2 segments
    \item Cult Ascendancy [6]: +1 segment
\end{itemize}

\section{Session 3: The Cosmic Coil}

\subsection*{Climax Setup}
The Chamber of Transformation assaults every sense. The ceiling is lost in shadow, and the walls pulse with a heartbeat that's definitely not human. The air is thick with ozone, copper, and something obscene. Hundreds of cultists fill the tiered seating, their bodies showing signs of transformation. At the center, an altar carved from crystallized ichor gleams, surrounded by bubbling ichor pools.

\subsection*{Multiple Paths}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Greater Good Victory}: Embrace cosmic role, gain divine knowledge
    \item \textbf{Heroic Stand}: Destroy ritual through pure heroism
    \item \textbf{Tactical Retreat}: Evacuate civilians, destroy key components
    \item \textbf{Power Bargain}: Negotiate beneficial use of transformation energy
    \item \textbf{Sacrifice Play}: Self-sacrifice to save others
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Key Encounters}

\textbf{Chamber of Transformation} (All Attributes, DV 5)\\
The chamber itself fights you—floor tiles shift, walls sprout tentacles, and the air becomes a weapon. The cultists fight with desperate fury, and their blood tastes of corrupted dreams.

\textbf{Isoka's Manifestation} (Spirit + Resolve, DV 6)\\
She is beautiful and terrible—a vast serpent with the face of every person you've ever loved and hated. Her voice carries cosmic truth and seductive lies. The power she offers tastes like victory and corruption mixed.

\textbf{Final Choice} (Presence + Insight, DV 4–6)\\
This moment assaults every sense with cosmic consequence. The air crackles with power, the chanting reaches a crescendo, and you can taste the future on your tongue.

\subsection*{Resolution}
The aftermath should taste of copper and finality, whether you've saved the world or damned it.

\subsection*{Clocks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resolve based on filled segments
    \item Each filled segment = 1 SB for ongoing campaign threads
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}

\textit{“The Serpent's Coil”} is ready for play. The taste of copper and destiny hangs heavy in the air of Midh Ahkaz, where ancient powers stir and heroes must rise to meet them. Will you embrace the blood-soaked path to legendary status, or will you stand against cosmic forces that would transform the world itself?

Whether you emerge as saviors of the city or dark lords of your own domain, your actions will echo through the ages. The serpent's coil tightens around the world, but heroes can become strong enough to break any chain—or perhaps become something even greater in the process.

Remember: In true sword and sorcery fashion, this adventure rewards bold action, clever tactics, and heroic sacrifice. Make every victory feel hard-won and every defeat a setup for an even greater comeback. By Crom's beard and by the gods of glory, let the blood flow and the legends begin!
