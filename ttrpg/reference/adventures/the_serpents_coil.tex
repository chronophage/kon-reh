\section{Adventure Overview}

\subsection{Premise}

In the frontier city of Midh Ahkaz, wood-elf infiltrators serve Isoka, the Angel of Transformation. Unbeknownst to the cultists themselves, they are pawns in a cosmic game—their "transformation" rituals are actually part of Isoka's mysterious agenda, the full scope of which even she may not completely understand.

A disgraced Black Banners captain, his massive Vilikari friend, and a young Ykrul rogue must penetrate the city's defenses to rescue a chieftain's child, but they will discover that all is not as it seems. The serpents slither in unexpected ways, and what begins as a simple rescue mission escalates into an epic battle where the heroes must choose between personal power and cosmic responsibility.

\subsection{Themes}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Sword and Sorcery Adventure: Fast-paced action with escalating stakes
  \item Cosmic Power Fantasy: Characters grow in power as the adventure progresses
  \item Hidden Truths: Enemies may not know they're enemies
  \item Epic Transformation: Physical and spiritual evolution through conflict
  \item Moral Complexity: Heroes may need to embrace partial corruption to fight greater evil
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Power Fantasy Elements}

This adventure uses a Momentum Clock system instead of Sanity mechanics:

\textbf{Momentum Clock (4 segments):}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Segment 1:} +1 Success to all rolls
\item \textbf{Segment 2:} Remove 1 Banked CP
\item \textbf{Segment 3:} +2 Successes to each roll
\item \textbf{Segment 4:} Clear all CP, +1 die to all rolls until end of scene
\end{itemize}

When the clock fills, heroes gain temporary epic power. When it empties (through failures/backlash), they suffer temporary weakness:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Segment 3:} -1 Success to all rolls
\item \textbf{Segment 2:} Generate 2 CP on next roll
\item \textbf{Segment 1:} -1 die to all rolls
\item \textbf{Segment 0:} +2 DV to all checks, generate 4 CP
\end{itemize}

\section{Key NPCs}

\subsection{Captain Marcus "The Disgraced" Dravik}

A former condotta captain whose unit was disbanded after a mission went catastrophically wrong. His reputation in tatters, he now takes on desperate jobs to survive. Dravik is haunted by the screams he heard in the Mistlands and drinks to forget—but the memories only grow stronger.

\textbf{Attributes:} Body 4, Wits 3, Spirit 2, Presence 3 \\
\textbf{Skills:} Melee 4, Command 3, Survival 2, Insight 2 \\
\textbf{Background:} Former Black Banners Captain \\
\textbf{Motivation:} Redemption through one last heroic act \\
\textbf{Secret:} He witnessed something in the Mistlands that should not exist

\subsection{Korvash the Iron-Blooded}

A massive Vilikari warrior whose family was destroyed in the Ykrul Wars. He fights not for coin, but for the satisfaction of battle and the protection of the innocent. Korvash carries the ancestral war-axe of his house, a weapon that remembers every life it has taken.

\textbf{Attributes:} Body 5, Wits 2, Spirit 4, Presence 2 \\
\textbf{Skills:} Melee 5, Athletics 4, Endurance 3, Lore 1 \\
\textbf{Background:} Vilikari Warrior \\
\textbf{Motivation:} Honor and protection of the weak \\
\textbf{Weakness:} Prone to berserker rage when allies are threatened

\subsection{Szik the Swift}

A young Ykrul who left the steppes seeking fortune in the cities. Quick-witted and quicker with a blade, Szik has survived by his wits and agility. He has a particular talent for picking locks and pockets, and an even greater talent for talking his way out of trouble.

\textbf{Attributes:} Body 3, Wits 4, Spirit 2, Presence 3 \\
\textbf{Skills:} Stealth 4, Skullduggery 3, Athletics 3, Deception 3 \\
\textbf{Background:} Ykrul Outlander \\
\textbf{Motivation:} Wealth and adventure \\
\textbf{Quirk:} Speaks to his daggers as if they were old friends

\section{The City of Midh Ahkaz}

\subsection{Geography and History}

Midh Ahkaz sits at the crossroads of three great powers: the Utaran successor states to the west, the Ykrul steppes to the north, and the mountain kingdoms to the east. Once a frontier camp during the Second Ykrul War, it grew into a proper city when the Treaty of Flintpike made it a neutral trading post.

The city is built in three tiers:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{The Low City:} Merchant quarters, workshops, and the docks
  \item \textbf{The Middle City:} Administrative buildings, temples, and the homes of minor nobles
  \item \textbf{The High City:} The Council Hall, the Governor's Palace, and the homes of the wealthy
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Political Structure}

The city is governed by a Council of Twelve, drawn from the merchant families, the military, and the clergy. Recently, three new council members have joined—each with mysterious backgrounds and unsettling mannerisms.

When approaching Midh Ahkaz, draw cards using the regional generator:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Spade: The city gates (tall stone walls with iron reinforcements)
  \item Heart: The Gate Captain (suspicious military officer)
  \item Club: Curfew has been imposed due to "security concerns"
  \item Diamond: Emergency passage papers (good for one entry)
\end{itemize}
Clock Size: 6 segments (standard journey complications)

\section{The Isoka Cult}

\subsection{Origins and Beliefs}

The Isokai are wood-elf infiltrators who serve Isoka, the Angel of Transformation. They believe they are working toward a glorious future where mortals transcend their limitations through sacred transformation rituals. What they don't know - and what even their goddess may not fully understand - is the true cosmic significance of their actions.

Their bodies have been subtly altered through generations of communion with Isoka, gaining scaled skin patches, enhanced senses, and the ability to regenerate minor wounds.

\subsection{Organization}

The cult operates in cells of 3-7 members, each led by a Serpent Speaker who can commune directly with Isoka. The hierarchy includes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Coil Master:} The overall leader of the cult in Midh Ahkaz
  \item \textbf{Serpent Speakers:} High priests who can channel the god's will
  \item \textbf{Fang Bearers:} Warrior-priests who serve as the cult's muscle
  \item \textbf{Scale Singers:} Infiltrators who maintain cover identities
  \item \textbf{Egg Tenders:} Cultists who care for the serpent spawn
\end{itemize}

\section{The Adventure}

\subsection{Opening Scene: The Job}

The PCs are approached in a dim tavern in the Low City by an elderly Ykrul chieftain named Grok the Steadfast. His daughter, Yara, has been "taken" by city guards under mysterious circumstances. He offers them a substantial reward to rescue her before she is "transformed into the cornerstone of the new serpent age."

\textbf{Grok the Steadfast:}
An aging Ykrul chieftain whose people have trading rights with Midh Ahkaz. He is desperate and willing to pay well for his daughter's return.

\textbf{Attributes:} Body 3, Wits 3, Spirit 4, Presence 3 \\
\textbf{Skills:} Command 3, Survival 3, Insight 2, Sway 2 \\
\textbf{Motivation:} Rescue his daughter at any cost \\
\textbf{Secret:} He suspects the city is under supernatural influence

\subsection{Investigation Phase}

Before the rescue, the PCs should have opportunities to investigate the city and gather information. Key locations include:

\subsubsection{The Black Goat Tavern}

A rough establishment in the Low City where mercenaries and soldiers gather. The bartender, an aging human woman named Mira, has noticed strange things happening in the city.

\textbf{Mira the Bartender:}
Sharp-eyed and sharp-tongued, Mira has ears everywhere and knows most of the city's secrets.

\textbf{Attributes:} Body 2, Wits 4, Spirit 3, Presence 4 \\
\textbf{Skills:} Insight 4, Deception 3, Sway 3, Lore 2 \\
\textbf{Information:} Guards have been acting strangely; several people have "disappeared" after being taken to the High City

\subsubsection{The Temple of the Open Sky}

A Ykrul shrine where travelers can seek guidance. The priest, an elderly shaman named Whisperwind, has been having disturbing visions.

\textbf{Whisperwind:}
A Ykrul shaman who has served the temple for thirty years. Recently, his visions have become increasingly disturbing.

\textbf{Attributes:} Body 2, Wits 3, Spirit 5, Presence 3 \\
\textbf{Skills:} Faith 4, Insight 4, Lore 3, Healing 2 \\
\textbf{Vision:} He has seen serpents coiling around the city's heart, and heard whispers of transformation and power

\subsection{The Rescue Mission}

The PCs learn that Yara is being held in the Governor's Palace in the High City. Getting there will require navigating the city's defenses and avoiding the enhanced security measures.

\subsubsection{Approach Options}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Direct Assault:} Storm the gates and fight their way through the guards
  \item \textbf{Stealth Infiltration:} Use Szik's skills to sneak in through service passages
  \item \textbf{Social Engineering:} Convince the guards they belong through deception
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Governor's Palace}

The palace has been subtly altered. Hallways seem to stretch longer than they should, and the air carries a faint, energizing scent that makes people feel more confident. The architecture incorporates serpentine motifs—coiling banisters, snake-headed spouts, and murals depicting glorious transformations.

As the PCs explore the palace, they should notice:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Shadows that move with purpose and strength
  \item Whispers of power and transformation in an unknown language
  \item Rooms that seem to enhance their abilities
  \item A growing sense that they are becoming more than they were
\end{itemize}
Each of these observations should advance the Momentum Clock by 1 segment.

\subsection{The Revelation}

When the PCs finally reach Yara, they discover that she has willingly joined the cult, believing she will gain power beyond her wildest dreams. However, she has begun to suspect that something is wrong with the transformation process—her friends who underwent the ritual are changing in disturbing ways.

\textbf{Yara Grokdaughter:}
A headstrong young Ykrul woman who joined the Isokai seeking power, but is beginning to question what she's become.

\textbf{Attributes:} Body 2, Wits 3, Spirit 2, Presence 4 \\
\textbf{Skills:} Deception 3, Sway 3, Performance 2, Insight 1 \\
\textbf{Condition:} Beginning transformation into serpent form \\
\textbf{Motivation:} Power and transcendence, but growing doubts \\
\textbf{Weakness:} Vulnerable to appeals to her love for her father

\textbf{Doubt Mechanic:} Yara's internal conflict grows as she witnesses disturbing signs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Seeing transformed cultists behave erratically (+1 doubt)
  \item Hearing Isoka's whispers firsthand (+1 doubt)
  \item Learning of previous "transformations" that went wrong (+1 doubt)
\end{itemize}
When doubt reaches 3, she becomes a potential ally to the PCs.

\subsection{The True Power}

The PCs discover that Yara is just one of many young people who have been "initiated" into the cult. In the palace's basement, they find a vast chamber where hundreds of enhanced cultists are being trained. At the center sits the Coil Master, preparing the ritual to transform Midh Ahkaz.

However, a captured Inaean priest reveals conflicting information about the truth. Some of his claims seem exaggerated, other information is deliberately obscured, and his fanaticism may lead him to lie about key details. He speaks of cosmic catastrophe and divine intervention, but his version of events may not be entirely reliable.

\textbf{The Coil Master - Serpent Speaker Thaliss:}
A former high elf who has achieved partial transformation, believing he serves a noble cause.

\textbf{Attributes:} Body 3, Wits 5, Spirit 4, Presence 4 \\
\textbf{Skills:} Arcana 5, Deception 4, Command 3, Insight 3 \\
\textbf{Abilities:} Can cast Umbramancy and Geomancy spells, immune to mind-affecting effects, can regenerate from severe injuries \\
\textbf{Motivation:} To serve Isoka and bring about beneficial transformation \\
\textbf{Weakness:} Vulnerable to bright light and holy magic

The Coil Master never reveals the full truth about Isoka's cosmic role. He speaks in riddles and half-truths, making claims about knowledge he may not actually possess. His certainty may be based on faith rather than facts, leaving the PCs to piece together what's really happening.

\section{Campaign Hooks and Extensions}

\subsection{Ongoing Cosmic Threats}

If the PCs don't completely resolve the Isoka situation, the cosmic mystery remains. Other Angel-Sisters may take action, or forces beyond mortal comprehension may stir.

\subsection{The Greater Conspiracy}

The events in Midh Ahkaz may be just one front in a larger conflict between cosmic forces and mortal ambition, leading to epic campaign-scale warfare.

\subsection{Personal Evolution}

PCs who were exposed to the cult's influence may find they're not entirely free of its effects, but can channel the power for heroic purposes, creating personal epic storylines.

\subsection{The Angel Wars}

The revelation about Isoka and her sisters may be just the beginning. What other cosmic entities are manipulating mortal affairs, and what are their true motives?

\section{GM Tips and Advice}

\subsection{Building Epic Tension}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use the Momentum Clock as a visual representation of rising and falling power
  \item Let victories feel truly epic and defeats genuinely crushing
  \item Describe how characters become more impressive as power grows
  \item Make the stakes clear: not just survival, but the fate of the universe
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Managing Power Fantasy Elements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Power should feel earned through heroic actions and clever play
  \item Let players feel increasingly awesome as the adventure progresses
  \item Provide opportunities to showcase enhanced abilities
  \item Balance empowerment with meaningful challenges that can still threaten heroes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Narrative Techniques}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The known should become legendary through the characters' actions
  \item Revelations should be both satisfying and empowering
  \item Partial knowledge can drive heroic ambition
  \item Let destiny be part of the power fantasy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Combat Pacing}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Early encounters should establish the threat level
  \item Mid-adventure combats should showcase growing heroism
  \item Climactic battles should feel truly epic with high Momentum
  \item Allow for dramatic reversals that test heroic resolve
\end{itemize}

\section{Adventure Conclusion}

The adventure should end with a climactic confrontation where the PCs must choose between several epic options, each with significant consequences. The true power fantasy lies not just in defeating monsters, but in the heroic choices that define legends.

Whether they embrace their role in cosmic mysteries, save the city through pure heroism, or sacrifice everything for uncertain greater good, their actions should echo through the rest of the campaign, making this not just an adventure, but a defining moment that establishes their legendary status.

Remember that in Fate's Edge, power comes with responsibility. Every epic victory should plant seeds for future challenges, and every choice should shape the world in meaningful ways. Let the serpents offer power, but let the heroes choose their own destiny.

\textbf{Final Note:}
In true sword and sorcery fashion, this adventure rewards bold action, clever tactics, and heroic sacrifice. The Momentum Clock represents the ebb and flow of epic combat and adventure - heroes rise to legendary heights, face crushing setbacks, and rise again even greater than before. Make every victory feel hard-won and every defeat a setup for an even greater comeback. This is not just a test of skill, but a proving ground for legends.

The serpent's coil tightens around the world, but heroes can become strong enough to break any coil - or perhaps become something even greater in the process.
