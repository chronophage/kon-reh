## **The Crimson Ledger of Ecktoria**

### **The Pitch:**
In the marble forums of Ecktoria, where the Utaran Empire's ghosts still echo through colonnaded halls, the city's greatest scandal isn't political—it's literary. The **Crimson Codex**, a legendary book of forbidden knowledge said to contain every secret, every lie, and every truth that could destroy the city's elite, has been stolen from the Library of Keys. 

But this isn't just any theft. The Codex was bound in oaths—literally. Each page was a magically enforced secret, kept by the weight of sworn vows. Now those oaths are breaking, and as they do, Ecktoria's power structure is crumbling. Senators confess to treason in their sleep, merchants reveal the locations of their hidden vaults, and the High Priest of the Everflame begins preaching heretical sermons about the "true" history of the Empire.

### **The Hook:**
The PCs are hired by **Livaea, the Crimson Courtier** herself (appearing as a patron to a desperate Runekeeper PC, or through a powerful NPC contact) to recover the Codex before the city tears itself apart. But Livaea has her own agenda—the Codex contains the location of the **Red Branch**, a splinter faction of the old Utaran nobility who vanished centuries ago but may hold the key to restoring the Empire.

The twist? The theft was orchestrated by **Inaea, Angel of the Spider**, working through a network of blackmail victims who finally found the courage to fight back. The breaking oaths aren't a bug—they're a feature. And the Codex is writing itself as it's read, with each secret revealed adding new pages of devastating truths.

### **What Makes It Cool:**

**Social Chaos as Adventure Hook:** Instead of monsters or armies, the threat is cascading social collapse. Noble houses turn on each other, merchant guilds expose each other's illegal dealings, and the city's famous bureaucracy begins processing absurd requests (like citizenship for statues, or marriage licenses for long-dead couples).

**Living MacGuffin:** The Codex isn't just a book—it's actively rewriting itself, creating new secrets even as old ones are revealed. Players might find that reading certain passages changes their own character sheets or creates new complications.

**Patron Theater:** Livaea and Inaea's conflict plays out through the PCs. Livaea wants order restored through manipulation and seduction of power, while Inaea wants the web of lies to collapse so new connections can form. Players must choose sides or forge their own path.

**Genre Mashup:** High political intrigue meets magical mystery. Think "House of Cards" meets "The Name of the Wind" in a setting where words have weight and secrets are currency.

**Ecktoria as Character:** The city itself becomes a reactive NPC. As oaths break, districts change personality—military quarters become paranoid, merchant districts turn anarchic, religious areas become fanatical.

### **Session Structure:**
1. **The Confessions** - Arrive to find the city's elite involuntarily spilling secrets, hired to investigate
2. **Threads of Power** - Follow the web of blackmail and counter-blackmail as alliances shift
3. **The Red Branch** - Discover the exiled nobles are trying to return through the chaos
4. **Patron's Gambit** - Livaea and Inaea make their final moves for control
5. **The New Ecktoria** - Decide what kind of city rises from the ashes of broken oaths

### **Cool Set Pieces:**
- A dinner party where everyone reveals their darkest secrets in turn
- The Forum of Keys where magical contracts are being nullified mid-signature
- A chase through the city's bureaucratic maze as players try to stop a marriage between political rivals that would unite the city's factions
- The final confrontation in the Library where the Codex is rewriting itself with each revelation

The adventure rewards social manipulation, investigation, and creative use of Runekeeper magic (especially oath-based rites), while the collapsing social order creates constant pressure and unexpected alliances.
