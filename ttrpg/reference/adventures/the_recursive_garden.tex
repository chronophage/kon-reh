\section{Campaign Overview}

\subsection*{\faMap\ Campaign Hook}

\textbf{The Premise:} The PCs are scholars, mathematicians, or logic-seekers who have been drawn to the fae realm of Aelinnel, renowned for its stone spires, moonlit groves, and the peculiar mathematical precision of its fae inhabitants. They've come seeking knowledge of advanced geometries and numerical harmonies, but find instead that the very logic of this realm operates on recursive principles that challenge their understanding.

\textbf{Real Hook:} Something in the Recursive Garden has begun to malfunction - the mathematical laws that govern fae magic are creating logical paradoxes that threaten to unravel reality itself. The fae, bound by their own mathematical nature, cannot simply "fix" the problem without understanding its root cause. The PCs, as outsiders with different logical frameworks, may be the only ones who can perceive and resolve the recursive anomaly.

\textbf{Thematic Elements:} Recursive Logic, Mathematical Paradoxes, Fae Precision, Reality Distortion, Logical Puzzles

\textbf{Key Mathematical Horror Elements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Logical Decay:} Mathematical certainty becomes uncertain
    \item \textbf{Recursive Traps:} Actions that loop infinitely
    \item \textbf{Geometric Impossibility:} Spaces that defy Geomancerean logic
    \item \textbf{Proof Collapse:} Established truths begin to contradict themselves

\section{Custom Mathematical Mechanics}

\subsection*{\faSquareRootAlt\ Special Campaign Mechanics}

\textbf{Recursive Logic Mechanic:}
When encountering fae logic or mathematical puzzles, PCs must make Wits + Lore rolls (DV 2) to navigate without falling into recursive loops. Each failure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generates 2 CP that the GM can spend for logical complications
    \item Advances Logical Consistency Clock by 1 segment
    \item May trap character in a logical loop (lose next action)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recursive Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item "To know the answer, you must first know that you don't know the answer."
    \item "This statement is false about the path ahead."
    \item "The correct door is the one that leads to the door that leads to..."
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Escape Methods:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spend 1 Boon to break the recursion
    \item Apply a different logical framework (requires relevant skill)
    \item Accept a paradox and move forward anyway (generates 1 CP)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Geometric Impossibility Perception:}
When navigating spaces that defy normal geometry, PCs must make Wits + Survival rolls (DV 3) to avoid spatial anomalies. Each failure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generates 2 CP for reality distortions
    \item Advances Garden Integrity Clock by 2 segments
    \item Character becomes temporarily lost in dimensional folds
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Impossibility Manifestations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Triangles with four angles
    \item Rooms smaller on the outside than the inside
    \item Paths that are longer to walk than to measure
    \item Objects that exist in multiple places simultaneously
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Navigation Aids:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mathematical instruments (compass, straightedge) may provide +1 die
    \item Fae guidance (if trustworthy) can prevent failures
    \item Accepting the impossibility grants DV 1 on next navigation roll
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Proof Verification:}
When attempting to establish or verify mathematical truths, PCs can make Wits + Arcana rolls. Success creates temporary logical stability:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minor Proof (DV 1): Stabilize one clock for 1 segment
    \item Moderate Proof (DV 2): Reduce one clock by 1 segment
    \item Major Proof (DV 3): Stabilize all clocks for 1 round
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Proof Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Must be relevant to current situation
    \item May require specific mathematical knowledge
    \item Failed proofs accelerate relevant clocks
    \item Overly complex proofs may create new paradoxes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Numerical Sentience:}
As the anomaly grows, numbers begin to exhibit personality and agency:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prime numbers become stubborn and refuse to divide
    \item Irrational numbers express their infinite nature through rambling speech
    \item Negative numbers are pessimistic and spread doubt
    \item Zero becomes existentially confused about its purpose
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Interaction Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can be negotiated with (Presence + Diplomacy, DV 2-4)
    \item May provide clues or assistance
    \item Can become hostile if mathematical laws are violated
    \item Defeating hostile numbers requires solving their equations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Fractal Noble} - An infinitely detailed courtier whose presence causes cognitive dissonance. Every attempt to understand it reveals more contradictory details. Its attacks manifest as geometric patterns that repeat at smaller scales, never fully striking but always present. The entity exists in multiple social positions simultaneously - host, guest, judge, and prisoner all at once. It speaks in perfect logical syllogisms that lead to impossible conclusions, and its very presence makes nearby spaces fold in on themselves geometrically.

\textbf{Clock Size:} 8 segments (King rank)
\textbf{Power:} Cap 5 entity with Fractal Attack ability
\textbf{Threat:} Contradiction Embodied - causes cognitive dissonance
\textbf{Personality:} Paradox Noble - exists in multiple states
