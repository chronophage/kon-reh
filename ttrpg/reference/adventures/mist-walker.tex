\textbf{Title:} & The Mist Walker \\
\textbf{Region:} & Mistlands - Bells, Salt, and Breath \\

\section{Premise}

A powerful entity from the Ways Between is using the Mistlands as a conduit to enter the mortal world, corrupting the bell-lines and threatening to break the barriers between realms. The players must investigate the growing supernatural disturbances, uncover the source of the corruption, and either stop the entity or find a way to send it back where it came from.

\section{Hook}

The adventure begins when the players encounter one of the following scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
\item A ferryman refuses to take them across a normally safe waterway, claiming "the mist walks where it shouldn't" and that bells have been heard tolling underwater.
\item A Bell-Warden approaches them in a tavern, desperate for help as bell-towers across the region are ringing without being touched, and some bells are ringing notes that don't exist.
\item Their patron sends them with a letter that should have arrived three days ago, but the courier claims they delivered it - yet the recipient has no knowledge of receiving it.
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Mechanics}

\subsection{Mist Corruption Clock [8]}
\begin{mechanics}
\item[Advance +1:] Bell-lines fail to function properly
\item[Advance +1:] NPCs become possessed or influenced
\item[Advance +2:] Players fail to properly sanctify corrupted areas
\item[Advance +1:] The Mist Walker successfully tempts a PC with forbidden knowledge
\item[Advance +2:] Direct confrontation with entity results in player retreat
\item[When Full:] Barriers between realms begin to collapse, permanent supernatural changes to region
\end{mechanics}

\subsection{Bell-Line Functionality}
\begin{mechanics}
\item[Normal:] +1 Position for travelers, clear warnings
\item[Partially Corrupted:] Controlled position, misleading warnings (DV 4 to navigate)
\item[Fully Corrupted:] Desperate position, attracting rather than warning (DV 5+ to navigate)
\item[Restored:] Return to normal function, may grant +1 Boon for safe passage
\end{mechanics}

\subsection{Possession and Influence}
\begin{mechanics}
\item[Detection:] Insight + Notice vs DV 4 to identify possessed NPC
\item[Resistance:] Spirit + Resolve vs DV 3 to resist temptation
\item[Temporary Boost:] Possessed characters gain +1 die to one skill for scene, but generate 1 SB
\item[Permanent Corruption:] If not cleansed, mark 1 segment on personal Corruption Clock
\item[Cleansing:] Lore + Arcana vs DV 5, requires sanctified iron and salt
\end{mechanics}

\section{Possible Resolutions}

\subsection{Banishment}
\begin{resolution}{Banishment}
\item[Requirements:] 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Sanctify all 4 major corrupted bell-towers (Extended challenge, each DV 5)
    \item Gather 3 bells that still ring true (Investigation challenge, DV 4 each)
    \item Perform willing sacrifice (Social/Command challenge, DV 5)
  \end{itemize}
\item[Procedure:] Combined ritual requiring all party members
\item[Costs:] 2 segments marked on each participant's Corruption Clock
\item[Outcome:] Mist Walker banished, bell-lines restored, but some supernatural knowledge lost
\end{resolution}

\subsection{Negotiation}
\begin{resolution}{Negotiation}
\item[Discovery:] Entity was drawn by ancient barrier damage from 200 years ago
\item[Options:] 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Help repair original damage (Extended Craft/Arcana challenge, DV 6)
    \item Offer different anchoring point (Investigation/Survival challenge, DV 5)
    \item Trade knowledge for departure (Lore vs DV 4, but mark Corruption)
  \end{itemize}
\item[Costs:] Ongoing obligation to monitor new anchor point, 1 segment Corruption per party member
\item[Outcome:] Entity departs but may return with new demands, players gain some forbidden knowledge
\end{resolution}

\subsection{Containment}
\begin{resolution}{Containment}
\item[Approach:] Strengthen existing wards rather than eliminate entity
\item[Requirements:] 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Establish new protective measures (Craft + Arcana, DV 5)
    \item Create monitoring protocol (Command + Lore, DV 4)
    \item Accept entity's continued presence (Mark ongoing Complication)
  \end{itemize}
\item[Costs:] Ongoing responsibility, periodic Corruption exposure
\item[Outcome:] Entity contained but players become wardens, gain access to some supernatural knowledge
\end{resolution}

\section{Rewards and Consequences}

\subsection{Immediate Rewards}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ward-Salt allotment (2 uses): +1 Position when navigating mist
\item Bell-Key to one tower: Access to restricted bell-line areas

\item \textbf{Containment:} Players become responsible wardens, gain 1 follower (Bell-Warden apprentice)
\item \textbf{Personal Effects:} Individual corruption or enlightenment based on choices made
\end{itemize}

\section{GM Notes}

\subsection{Pacing}
Maintain tension by gradually increasing supernatural elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Session 1: Minor disturbances, unsettling but manageable
\item Session 2: Direct supernatural encounters, clear otherworldly threat
\item Session 3: Full manifestation, existential threat to region
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Player Agency}
Provide multiple paths to resolution:
\begin{itemize}
\item Combat approach: Direct confrontation with possessed NPCs and entity
\item Investigation approach: Decoding supernatural phenomena to find weaknesses
\item Social approach: Negotiating with entity or managing possessed NPCs
\item Ritual approach: Complex sanctification and restoration procedures
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Atmosphere}
Emphasize isolation and otherworldly nature:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use fog, bells, and shifting paths to create unsettling atmosphere
\item Sound effects: Distant bell tones, whispers in mist, temporal echoes
\item Visual elements: Moving reflections, false memories, phasing objects
\item Temporal distortion: Events that don't follow logical sequence
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Story Beats}
Use Mist Walker's influence to generate complications:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 SB: Minor temporal displacement, false memory fragment
\item 2 SB: NPC becomes temporarily possessed, misleading information
\item 3 SB: Environmental hazard from bell resonance, path becomes迷宫-like
\item 4+ SB: Direct manifestation of Mist Walker's influence, major NPC possession
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Session-Specific Guidance}

\textbf{Session 1 Focus:} Establish supernatural threat without overwhelming players. Use unsettling but manageable phenomena to build tension.

\textbf{Session 2 Focus:} Escalate to direct supernatural encounters. Players should feel the threat is real and growing.

\textbf{Session 3 Focus:} Climactic confrontation. All previous elements converge. Players' choices have clear, significant consequences.

\subsection{Alternative Endings}

If players fail to resolve the main conflict:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Partial Success:} Reduce corruption but don't eliminate threat. Sets up sequel adventure.
\item \textbf{Compromise:} Players become possessed but use influence to contain entity from within.
\item \textbf{Pyrrhic Victory:} Banish entity but at great cost (major NPC death, permanent regional damage).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scaling for Different Tiers}

\textbf{Tier I (Rookie):} Reduce entity Cap to 3, simplify ritual requirements, provide more NPC assistance.

\textbf{Tier III (Veteran):} Increase entity Cap to 5, add secondary entities, complicate ritual with additional requirements.

\textbf{Tier IV (Paragon):} Add political complications, multiple simultaneous anchor points, entity gains patron backing.
