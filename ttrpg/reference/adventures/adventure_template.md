## Design Philosophy Requirements

### Must Include:
- **Meaningful Player Choice:** Every major decision should have clear, lasting consequences
- **Mechanical-Theme Integration:** Every new system should serve the adventure's themes
- **Gradual Complexity:** If complex mechanics, introduce gradually across sessions
- **Multiple Valid Approaches:** Combat, social, and skill-based solutions should all be viable
- **Character Spotlights:** Each session should provide opportunities for different character types
- **Clear Continuation Hooks:** Win or lose, the world should respond meaningfully

### Should Avoid:
- **Railroading:** Player choices should genuinely matter to outcomes
- **Information Dumps:** Lore should emerge through play, not exposition
- **Mechanical Bloat:** New systems should enhance, not complicate unnecessarily
- **Unwinnable States:** Even failure should lead to interesting continuation
- **Generic Elements:** Every location, NPC, and encounter should serve the theme

### Excellence Indicators:
- **Innovative but Accessible:** New mechanics that feel natural to the genre
- **Thematic Consistency:** Every element reinforces core themes
- **Scalable Design:** Works for different group sizes and experience levels
- **Prep-Efficient:** GM can run with minimal preparation after first read
- **Session-Sized Beats:** Clear goals and climaxes for each session
- **Player Agency Documentation:** Clear guidance on handling unexpected choices
