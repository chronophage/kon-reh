# The Fate's Edge Adventure Template

## Core Concept Framework

### 1. Adventure Identity Statement
Every adventure should begin with a clear identity statement that answers:
- **What makes this adventure sing?** (Unique hook/theme)
- **What is the central tension?** (Core conflict)
- **What will players remember?** (Memorable takeaway)

### 2. Thematic Pillars (Choose 2-3)
- **Horror by...** (Consent, Atmosphere, Consequence)
- **Social by...** (Intrigue, Manipulation, Performance)
- **Exploration by...** (Discovery, Navigation, Revelation)
- **Combat by...** (Tactics, Momentum, Sacrifice)
- **Mystery by...** (Investigation, Revelation, Misdirection)

## Structural Template

### Act I: Entry & Engagement
**Hook (Opening Scene)**
- Present immediate, concrete stakes
- Introduce core threat/ally/opportunity
- Establish tone through sensory details
- Surface one visible player advantage/resource

**Establishment Beats (2-3 scenes)**
- Character integration with setting
- First major encounter (social/combat/investigation)
- Introduction of primary campaign clocks
- Seed first hard choice or moral dilemma

### Act II: Complications & Choices
**Rising Tension (3-4 scenes)**
- Escalate core conflict
- Introduce secondary threats/allies
- Present meaningful player choices
- Advance campaign clocks through player actions

**Midpoint Crisis**
- Major revelation or setback
- Test player commitments
- Shift power dynamics
- Consequences that ripple forward

### Act III: Climax & Resolution
**Approach to Climax**
- Players consolidate resources/position
- Final preparations/choices
- Last opportunity for alternative approaches

**Climactic Encounter**
- Multiple resolution paths
- Significant consequences regardless of outcome
- Integration of adventure's core themes
- Meaningful cost for success

**Resolution & Aftermath**
- Immediate consequences of choices
- Award earned resources/advancement
- Seed ongoing campaign elements
- Character reflection/development moments

## Mechanical Integration Framework

### Core Innovation Box
```
Signature System: [Name] - [Brief description]
• Purpose: [What thematic element does this serve?]
• Integration: [How does it connect to existing mechanics?]
• Player Agency: [What choices does it enable?]
• Sample Uses: [2-3 concrete examples]
```

### Resource Management Layer
**Adventure-Specific Resources:**
- What new currencies/trackers are introduced?
- How do they interact with Boons/SB economy?
- What choices do they force players to make?
- How do they create tension/engagement?

**Asset Building Opportunities:**
- What can players gain that persists?
- How do assets change gameplay?
- What meaningful costs are associated?
- How do they scale with character investment?

### Custom Mechanics Integration
**New Resolution Methods:**
- When to use instead of/alongside core rolls
- How they interact with Position/DV
- What SB spends they enable
- How they handle partial success/failure

**Clock Architecture:**
- Primary campaign clock (6-12 segments)
- 2-3 supporting clocks (4-8 segments each)
- Clear advancement triggers tied to player actions
- Meaningful consequences when filled

## GM Support Systems

### Session Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Core conflict/choices identified
- [ ] Key NPCs with motivations/weaknesses
- [ ] Location descriptions with sensory details
- [ ] Custom mechanics summarized
- [ ] SB spend menus prepared
- [ ] Player agency moments highlighted

### Player Agency Reminders
**At Choice Points:**
- "What's the cost you're willing to pay?"
- "Who benefits if you succeed here?"
- "What would your character regret most?"
- "How does this align with your drives?"

**When Tension Lags:**
- Introduce time pressure
- Raise personal stakes
- Complicate success
- Force resource expenditure

### Complication Generator
**Mild (1 SB):** Environmental/Personal pressure
**Moderate (2 SB):** Tactical disadvantage/New element
**Serious (3 SB):** Major setback/Threat escalation
**Major (4+ SB):** Scene shift/Fundamental change

## Thematic Consistency Tools

### Tone Maintenance
- **Opening Description:** Set atmosphere with 2-3 vivid sensory details
- **NPC Voices:** Distinctive speech patterns/motivations
- **Environmental Storytelling:** What does the setting reveal?
- **Pacing Markers:** When to accelerate/decelerate tension

### Theme Reinforcement
**Each Scene Should:**
- Advance the core conflict OR reveal character
- Include at least one thematic element
- Present a meaningful choice or consequence
- Connect to larger campaign through details

### Moral Complexity Integration
- **Gray Choices:** No clear right/wrong options
- **Cascading Consequences:** Actions have multiple effects
- **Personal Stakes:** Tie to character backgrounds/drives
- **Community Impact:** Show broader effects of choices

## Resolution Path Framework

### Multiple Valid Approaches
1. **Direct Confrontation:** Face threat head-on
2. **Indirect Manipulation:** Work through others/systems
3. **Creative Solution:** Find alternative path
4. **Sacrificial Gambit:** Trade something significant

### Outcome Matrix
**Success:** Theme fulfilled, significant cost
**Compromise:** Partial goal, ongoing complications  
**Failure:** Goal blocked, new opportunities opened
**Transformation:** Unexpected change, new direction

### Consequence Types
- **Immediate:** Resolve within session
- **Ongoing:** Affect future sessions/campaign
- **Character:** Personal growth/trauma
- **World:** Setting permanently changed

## Scalability Framework

### Tier Adaptation
**Lower Tiers:**
- Reduce clock sizes by 2-4 segments
- Simplify custom mechanics
- Focus on 1-2 domains
- Reduce scope of political elements

**Higher Tiers:**
- Add complexity layers
- Include sub-plots for individual characters
- Expand scope to multiple realms
- Add long-term consequences

### Session Modularity
**Can Break Into:**
- 2-3 session arcs (Acts I-II, Act III, Epilogue)
- 1-2 session adventures (Core conflict focus)
- Standalone encounters (Single significant scene)

## Documentation Standards

### Player-Facing Materials
- Clear, concise handouts
- Visual clock representations
- Quick reference cards for custom mechanics
- Safety/toolkit reminders

### GM Quick Reference
- Key NPC motivations at a glance
- Scene/encounter flowcharts
- Custom mechanic summary
- SB spend menu cheat sheet

### Adventure Scaling Notes
- **Fast Play:** Core scenes highlighted
- **Deep Dive:** Additional content/complications
- **Character Spotlights:** Moments for each PC type
- **Campaign Integration:** Hooks to larger story
