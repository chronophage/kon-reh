The Forbidden Library — A Fate’s Edge Homage (Full Module v0.1)

Beneath Thepyrgos University’s Library of Keys, the Witness binds back the Ninth Rim. The stacks hunger. The catalogs lie. Knowledge stains.

⸻

0. Using This Module (OSR-deadly, Fate’s Edge-fair)

Intended Tone: Classic meatgrinder crawl where caution and procedure matter. About ~10% of tables will reach the Heart Chamber and make a final choice.

System Dial (Fate’s Edge terms):
	•	Position is king; Boons are rare; Fatigue and Stress are fast-accumulating.
	•	Clocks over HP: Pressure builds via Knowledge Corruption [8] and Containment Breach [10].
	•	Telegraph → Choice → Consequence every room.

Turn Procedure (summary):
	1.	Declare marching order, light, mapping method.
	2.	Enter/Interact (1 Turn). Record Noise sources (loud talk, metal on stone, Rites).
	3.	If 2+ Noise in a Turn → tick Containment Breach +1 and roll Wandering.
	4.	Every 3 Turns without safe light → each PC gains +1 Fatigue or Position –1 until rest.
	5.	End of scene → Library Reaction (1d6).

Resting:
	•	Catch-breath (5 minutes): clear 1 Fatigue or stabilize 1 Harm → Awareness +1.
	•	Secure rest (1 Zone, warded): clear Fatigue to 0, remove 1 minor Curse if you offer the Library a memory (see Annotations).

Annotations (Paying Truth):
	•	Write an honest margin note about what you learned in this Zone → unlock a Shortcut; the Library also gains 1 SB it may spend later to complicate.

⸻

1. Campaign Frames

Pick one, then seed hooks and rival parties accordingly.

Frame A: Faculty Errand Gone Wrong
	•	The party are assistants, auditors, or debt-bound scholars sent to retrieve a Sealed Sigil. Their sponsor vanishes after the first delve.

Frame B: The Immortality Rumor
	•	A patron dangles the Core Tome myth. Payment-on-proof. Rival claimants trail you inside.

Frame C: Last Line of Containment
	•	The Witness directly marks one PC. Your group must seal the Breach before rival delvers “free” the Library.

⸻

2. Factions & Curators

The Witness (Containment & Contradiction)
	•	Goal: Keep dangerous truths bound through paradox and procedure.
	•	Offer: Wards, sigils, honest answers to narrowly-scoped questions.
	•	Price: Oaths, silence, and pieces of your identity (Names, Roles).

The Hollow Librarian (Memory & Index)
	•	Goal: Preserve the trace of scholarship—even after scholars die.
	•	Offer: Safe routes through bygone wings; Echo negotiations.
	•	Price: Your regrets, cross-referenced.

The Void Keeper (Erasure & Release)
	•	Goal: Unwrite trapped knowledge and those imprisoned by it.
	•	Offer: Freedom from burdensome truths; immunity to overload.
	•	Price: Loss—of tags, of bonds, of details that once defined you.

NPC attitudes shift with Library Reaction and with which Truths the party chooses to embody.

⸻

3. Global Clocks & Dials
	•	Knowledge Corruption [8] (party): compulsion → bleed → addiction → erosion.
	•	Containment Breach [10] (site): refusal → gaps → vanishing wings → exposed core.
	•	Rival Delvers [6]: rivals advance toward a prize; tick on noise, delays, or failed bargains.
	•	Faculty Panic [4] (optional town clock): pressure to produce results; triggers bad funding
conditions or cuts off support.

Difficulty Dial (Unending Crawl):
	•	After each delve, increase one of: more hostile Wandering frequencies; fixtures drift; wards become puzzles. Every 3rd delve, add a Null Glyph to a previously safe Zone.

⸻

4. Hooks, Rumors, Rewards

Hooks
	1.	Letter of Requisition: “Retrieve the Sealed Sigil from the Restricted Stacks. Do not read.”
	2.	Black Candle Auction: A collector will pay for an Echo Shard with provenance.
	3.	Echo Rescue: A beloved mentor became an Annotation. Free them—or archive them properly.

Rumors (2 true, 2 bent, 2 false; roll d6)
	1.	The Core Tome writes your name across eternity. (Bent: you persist as reference.)
	2.	The Witness will answer any question asked once. (True, but answer costs a Name.)
	3.	A hidden stair rises to the surface if you recite your regrets. (True, once per delve.)
	4.	The Void Keeper can’t cross lamp-light. (False: it dims lamps, not barred by them.)
	5.	The Hollow Librarian remembers the dead by their debts. (Bent: by their footnotes.)
	6.	The Library forgets those who sleep within. (False: it remembers, then imitates.)

Meaningful Rewards (Treasure That Changes Futures)
	•	Echo Shard, Adaptive Key, Void Vellum, Sealed Sigil, Memory Core, Conceptual Anchor (see handout). Place 1–2 per Depth; don’t flood.

⸻

5. Rival Parties (use 1–2 concurrently)

The Redactors (erasure zealots)
	•	Edge: Silent signals; oilskin packs; solvent vials.
	•	Tactics: Trigger traps then pass through. Trade secrets for exits.

Stair-Runners (speed delvers)
	•	Edge: Ropeways, chalk codes, running ledgers.
	•	Tactics: Race to shortcuts; bait Eyearchivists onto others.

Faculty Audit Team (rules lawyers)
	•	Edge: Writs, stamps, speaking tube.
	•	Tactics: Parley with Curators; will petition for your confiscation.

Rival Move (1d6 when their clock ticks): 1 Snipe a treasure • 2 Ambush at a choke • 3 Misfile your map • 4 Collapse route • 5 Broker a truce for a price • 6 Leave a deadly footnote.

⸻

6. Depths & Generators

Each Depth has: presence cues, a generator, 6–10 keyed Zones, bespoke Wandering, and a signature Puzzle Room. Depths stack in risk and weirdness. Shortcuts can skip Depths at the cost of Annotations or Curses.

Wandering (roll d10 on Noise or every 2 Turns on 1–2): use the Catalog Hall table from the handout.

Puzzle Room (Depth 0): The Filing Engine — a crank, three levers, and a speaking tube. Correct filing sequence opens a lift; errors spawn Catalogue Hounds and tick Breach +1.

Exits: Index Stair (to Depth 1), Returns Chute (to Depth 1 with risk), or rare Regret Stair (spend a regret to surface once).

⸻

Depth 1: Restricted Stacks (Shifting Knowledge)

Atmosphere: aisles re-order to match intention; door-plaques shimmer.

Generator:
	•	What shifts? (d6): 1 Topics • 2 Stairs • 3 Doors • 4 Lights • 5 Labels • 6 Time.

	8.	Echo Scriptorium — Puzzle: Bargain with Echo Scholars; learn a rival’s next move. Price: Give a regret.

Wandering: use Restricted Stacks table.

Puzzle Room (Depth 1): The Index Game — rotating shelves; you must arrange topics to form a truthful path statement. Win: –1 Breach and a Memory Core. Loss: room rotates and splits the party.

Exits: Stairs relabel to Whispered Tomes; label lies send you to Sealed Wing early.

⸻

Depth 2: Whispered Tomes (Echoing Past)

Atmosphere: voices of the dead; footnote choruses; time eddies.

Generator:
	•	Which echo? (d6): 1 Mentor • 2 Rival • 3 Yourself • 4 Patron envoy • 5 Librarian’s apprentice • 6 Anonymous scholar.
	•	What cost? (d6): 1 A regret • 2 A voice • 3 A lie • 4 A bond • 5 A name • 6 A memory.

Keyed Zones (sample 6):
	1.	The Mirror Study — truth vs. comforting lie; choose one and live with it.
	2.	Footnote Choir — contradictions stun; harmonize with a hard choice.
	3.	Memory Garden — pick a fruit (gain insight; pay a painful truth).
	4.	Ink Flood — uphill current; sacrifice paper to cross.
	5.	Silent Debate — persuade without speaking; gestures only.
	6.	Regret Stair — spend a regret to surface; counts as Awareness +2 for rivals.

Wandering: use Whispered Tomes table.

Puzzle Room (Depth 2): The Paradox Lecture — defend a paradox with sincerity; success grants The Witness’s Mark (cannot lie, advantage vs. mental sway). Failure → Truth Addiction condition.

Exits: Easiest descent is via a misquoted proverb door that hates lies.

⸻

Depth 3: Sealed Wing (Contained Void)

Atmosphere: negative shelves; black vellum; sound-eating drafts.

Generator:
	•	Void Hazard (d6): 1 Draft • 2 Vines • 3 Mote • 4 Pit • 5 Null Glyph • 6 Unwriting Storm.
	•	Curator Angle (d6): 1 Audit • 2 Tribunal • 3 Bargain • 4 Warning • 5 Bait • 6 Judgment.

Keyed Zones (sample 6):
	1.	Audit Hall — Index Warden tallies infringements; pay with tags or time.
	2.	The Grey Scriptorium — bound readers; free them at the risk of Breach +1.
	3.	The Negative Well — a pit that erases gear tags; descend only with Conceptual Anchor.
	4.	Tribunal Chamber — full Eyearchivist appears; treat corners as cover.
	5.	Null Chapel — words vanish; solve with object arrangements.
	6.	Shadow Promenade — the Void Keeper passes; kneel (safe) or resist (Position –2, but learn its route).

Wandering: use Sealed Wing table.

Puzzle Room (Depth 3): The Unwriting Room — solve by noticing what’s missing; victory yields Void Vellum and Breach –1; failure erases one personal detail.

Exits: Thin fissures to the Heart Chamber; or looped stair that returns you to Depth 1 with a change.

⸻

Depth 4: Heart Chamber (Immortal Truth)

Atmosphere: all sections at once; your choices codify its form.

Structure: 3 Tests — Memory, Choice, Echo Gauntlet (see handout) — then The Final Choice:
	•	Join The Witness (contain) • Embrace The Ninth (unwrite) • Find Balance (reform the library).

Outcome Guidance:
	•	Contain: Library persists; rivals suppressed; party bears oaths and Names scarred; unlocks Curator Allies in future arcs.
	•	Unwrite: Souls/knowledge freed; Thepyrgos suffers information fractures; party gains Ninth’s Hunger.
	•	Balance: Create a third space; reduce Breach to 0; the Library becomes an ally—but marks you as its reformers (new obligations).

⸻

7. Bestiary (Library-Original)

Use the stat boxes from the handout (Archivorous Cube, Eyearchivist, Grey Scribe, Tome Mimic, Stacks Gargoyle, Paper Wraith, Rust Mites, Ink Bat Swarm, Bone Custodian, Sporespawn Archivists, Hanging Scroll Roper) plus:

Catalogue Hounds — Tier II, Harm 2 (Tear/Citation), Armor 1, Fast. Track misfiled scents; corner and howl; weak to clean erasures (fresh parchment). Trophy: Scent Slip (declare what this area “smells like” once; gain +1d to related tracking).

Index Warden — Tier III, Harm 2 (Audit/Cold), Armor 2, Slow. Freeze actions to check compliance; convert lies into fines (Fatigue); weak to paradox riddles. Trophy: Audit Stamp (once: retroactively declare a prepared permit).

⸻

8. Traps & Wards (Deadly, but Fair)
	•	Paper Guillotine • Vacuum Seal • Null Glyph • Counter-Stack (see handout).
	•	New: Premise Lock — unlock by stating your true intent; wrong → summon Grey Scribe.

⸻

9. Treasure & Progression
	•	Place 1 Major (Memory Core/Conceptual Anchor/Void Vellum) per Depth and 1–2 Minor (Echo Shard/Adaptive Key/Sealed Sigil).
	•	Citable stacks: gain Citable 3× → on death, become an Annotation the party can consult 1/session; the Library banks 1 SB.

Advancement Pressure:
	•	XP from Discoveries (first time only), Hard Lessons (failures that change behavior), Settled Debts (when you pay a Curse fairly), Contained Breach (–1 in a scene), Mercy to Echo (choose not to exploit).

⸻

10. GM Toolkit
	•	Signal, Don’t Surprise: always telegraph with drafts, marginalia, distant stamping, lamp sputters.
	•	Offer Outs: bargains, curses, shortcuts—with receipts.
	•	Escalate Through Clocks: Breach and Corruption should tick in different scenes.
	•	Rivals Matter: when indecision drags, let rivals move.
	•	Unending Crawl: between delves, change 1 map truth and 1 table entry; keep players slightly off-balance.

⸻

Perfect. Let’s keep expanding the full module in digestible stages.
Next: Appendices + Handouts + Tileable Map System + Curator Bargains.
After that we can generate Rival Delving Parties, Long-term consequences, and Campaign hooks.

⸻

✅ APPENDIX I — PLAYER HANDOUTS

(What a group receives in-world when they first learn of the Forbidden Library)

Handout A — The Map That Lies (physical note the GM can give)

“The forbidden wing is locked behind four seals.
The Ivory Seal guards order.
The Iron Seal guards truth.
The Glass Seal guards memory.
The Black Seal guards nothing — for nothing remains.”

This map is false. The rooms are real, but the pathways move.

A faint map on crumbling vellum:
- Stair 11 descends to Catalog Hall
- “Safe Rooms” marked with red ink
- Glossary of symbols (all incorrect)
- A note: “DO NOT WRITE YOUR NAME”

GM:
	•	If players trust the map → Position -1 for navigation scenes.
	•	If they openly doubt it → GM grants a 1-use “True Orientation” reroll later.

⸻

Handout B — The Curators’ Warnings

Found posted at random floors of Thepyrgos University, signed only “K.”

	1.	Do not speak to the Archivorous angels.
	2.	Do not read aloud.
	3.	Do not bring mirrors — they attract attention.
	4.	Do not accept help from Echoes unless you know their name.
	5.	Some books hunger.
	6.	The immortality rumor is a trap.
	7.	If you see a door where no door was before: run.

Players will not all follow these — that’s intended.

⸻

Handout C — Rumors Table (d8)

Roll secretly — players only know their rumor, not whether it’s true.

d8	Rumor	Truth
1	Immortality is real	Half-truth: You continue as annotation
2	The Witness protects seekers	Half: protects knowledge, not you
3	The Ninth Rim can grant wishes	False: the wish becomes erased
4	Nothing in the library can cross running water	True: textual wards dissolve
5	Curators can restore the dead	True… they return as Echoes
6	If you forget your name, you cannot die	True but terrifying
7	A Key of Bone opens any sealed wing	False
8	A door will eventually lead you home	True — at a cost


⸻

✅ APPENDIX II — TILEABLE MAP SYSTEM

The Forbidden Library uses tileable “Nodes” to emulate infinite depth.
Each floor generates from:
	•	1 Entrance Node
	•	2–4 Library Nodes
	•	1 Curator Node
	•	1 Breach Node
	•	1 Shortcut Node (optional)

Node Types

Node	Cue	Mechanics
Entrance Node	Normal library room	Easy clue, soft trap
Library Node	Bookshelves, traps, monsters	Classic crawl room
Curator Node	NPC encounter or bargain	Good treasure, bad price
Breach Node	Ninth Rim influence	Advance Breach clock
Shortcut Node	Teleport, shifting stair, dumbwaiter	Save Turns but cost Corruption

Room Connector Generator (d8)

d8	Connector
1	Impossible stair that doubles back
2	Door that moves to different wall next time
3	Corridor becomes narrower, books whisper
4	Shelves collapse, changing layout
5	Mirror door – reflection shows “correct” path
6	Hidden hatch through the floor
7	Dumbwaiter for books (fits 1 person)
8	Passage of pure black, requires light or a lie

When does the map change?
	•	When players lie
	•	When they read aloud
	•	When the Containment Breach clock ticks

This allows a GM to run the Library whether they prepared 3 rooms… or 300.

⸻

✅ APPENDIX III — CURATOR BARGAINS

(A way to offer help… at prices that feel OSR-lethal)

Roll 1d10 whenever a Curator appears:

d10	Curator Bargain
1	“Trade a regret.” Remove 1 Stress, take +1 Corruption
2	“Trade a memory.” Forget a skill for 1 delve, gain +1 Boon
3	“Trade a truth.” Choose a fact about your backstory to become false
4	“Trade a name.” Lose your surname; immune to name-based magic
5	“Trade a shadow.” You cast none; stealth +1 but healing -1 die
6	“Trade an oath.” Break a bond; Sealed Sigil treasure granted
7	“Trade a dream.” Can’t benefit from rest; +1 Armor this delve
8	“Trade a lie.” Admit something awful; remove 2 Fatigue
9	“Trade a page of yourself.” -1 max Stress; permanent +1 die to research
10	“Trade a future.” GM writes a Fate you must fulfill; in return, gain a brutal secret about the Library’s heart

These never feel safe. They should never be safe.

⸻

✅ APPENDIX IV — PLAYER FACING CONSEQUENCES

What if a PC “dies”?

Three possible results:
	•	Become an Echo Scholar (NPC)
	•	Become a living book (ask them questions later!)
	•	Become an Annotation (post-it note of cosmic knowledge: 1/session aid)

Players LOVE when death isn’t the end — but is still horrifying.

What if a PC “goes mad”?
	•	Replace a Trait with a Library-born Trait:
	•	“Cannot tell a lie”
	•	“Speaks only in questions”
	•	“Does not remember faces”
	•	“Believes the Library is home”

What if the Library wins?

Campaign shifts:
	•	Knowledge begins vanishing from the city
	•	Scholars disappear
	•	Magic users lose words of power
	•	Worlds begin “missing” historical events

This dungeon has consequences beyond loot.

⸻

✅ APPENDIX V — TILE SAMPLE KEYED FLOOR

Here is a sample Depth 1 “tile” floor that can be dropped in anywhere:

Depth 1 — The Catalog of Bright Lies

Entrance Node — The Index of All Indices
	•	A giant card catalog with 10,000,000 drawers
	•	Pull any drawer → reveals a rumor
	•	Pull your own drawer → gain +1 Corruption and +1 Boon

Library Node A — The Alphabetical Stairs
	•	Stone steps carved A–Z
	•	Saying a letter aloud makes the stairs shift
	•	Quiet = safe, Loud = trap

Library Node B — The Curator of Keys
	•	Bone Custodian with a ring of “keys”
	•	None open locks — all open questions
	•	Answering a question truthfully gives maps, lies cause stairs to vanish

Breach Node — The Correct Room
	•	A room that claims to know where the party wants to go
	•	It does — but leads to a Sealed Wing shortcut
	•	Automatically ticks Breach +2

Curator Node — The Assistant Archivist
	•	A friendly Echo Scholar
	•	Offers help navigating
	•	Actually a Tome Mimic baiting them into the Breach Node

Shortcut Node — The Yellow Book Cart
	•	Push it down corridor → it breaks through a false wall
	•	Player falls through to Depth 3
	•	Or rides the cart into a safe camp room
	•	50/50

Why this works:
	•	It telegraphs danger
	•	It uses choices, not HP attrition
	•	It feels like classic lethal D&D but uses Fate’s Edge mechanics

⸻

Appendices (to expand next)

A. Player Handout: Delving Procedures & Rumors
B. GM Handout: Wandering Tables & Bestiary
C. Map Tiles: Depth 0–3 node sketches
D. Curator Bargains & Prices
E. Conversion Notes for one-shots vs. campaigns

Excellent. We’ll build the full dungeon as a multi-depth megadelve, deadly, surreal, and endable only by a fraction of groups.

We’ll continue with Depth 4–6 and The Heart, keyed like the previous Depth 1 model, with modular, tileable rooms, OSR danger, and Fate’s Edge mechanics.

⸻

✅ DEPTH 4 — The Restricted Stacks (Shifting Knowledge)

Tone

Claustrophobic, twisting shelves, doors that change destination when opened twice, knowledge that tries to change the reader. Most delvers die here.

Structure
	•	Entrance Node
	•	3 Library Nodes
	•	1 Breach Node
	•	1 Curator Node
	•	Optional Shortcut Node (always tempting, always cursed)

⸻

Entrance Node — The Staircase of Misfiled Lives

A spiraling iron stair with names carved into every step.

Trigger: Each PC reads a step aloud.
	•	Gain +1 Corruption
	•	A memory from someone else intrudes: vision, skill, or trauma
	•	PCs can gain +1 die on a later scene by acting on that memory

Hidden danger:
Any PC who reads their own name vanishes into the stacks for 1 scene; the party hears them speaking calmly elsewhere. They return with a shortcut… and a curse.

⸻

Library Node A — The Shelves That Refuse

A narrow aisle packed with chained tomes. Every time someone speaks, the shelves swing shut to block the exit.
	•	Quiet = Controlled
	•	Speaking = Risky
	•	Shouting/fighting = Desperate, shelves slam and crush

Obstacle:
To open the shelves, a PC must:
	•	Recite a fact they believe is true, then
	•	Burn that belief: it ceases to be true about the world

Examples:
	•	“There is only one moon.” → now there are two
	•	“Magic requires a price.” → now it sometimes doesn’t
	•	“My brother is alive.” → maybe he isn’t

The GM chooses consequences subtly, later.

Treasure:
A book with a random true prophecy. If kept, +1 Breach whenever opened.

⸻

Library Node B — The Ink Tide

Floor slopes downward. Ahead, black ink floods from a toppled jar.

Mechanics:
	•	Crossing without action: Risky, on a 1–3, soaked in ink → cannot speak for one scene
	•	Casting a Rite in ink → Breach +1, the ink writes back
	•	Burning pages to dam the ink grants +1 Boon later

Monster Add-On:
Ink Bat Swarm erupts to blind torches and drown maps.

⸻

Library Node C — The Index Duel

Two Bone Custodians argue over how to index the party:
	•	“Fugitives.”
	•	“Future donors.”

They demand:
	•	A PC’s name (lose advantage against name-based attacks but immune to Wraiths)
	•	A secret (reduce Corruption by 1)
	•	Or blood (Harm 2, shelves let them pass)

If the party fights, the shelves begin re-writing themselves and cause a maze shift. All exits randomize.

⸻

Breach Node — The Shelf That Forgets You

A tall aisle with whispering books.
	•	Walking through quietly: Controlled
	•	Searching: Risky
	•	Reading: Desperate — PC loses a Trait for the delve

GM chooses:
	•	Forget a language
	•	Forget a skill
	•	Forget a bond
	•	Forget a memory of someone important

Reward: A Memory Core (ask 1 true question)

This room kills groups emotionally more often than mechanically.

⸻

Curator Node — The Grey Scribe

A pallid figure writes with a quill made from someone’s spine.

Bargain Options:
	•	Trade a memory for a map (lose a moment from backstory)
	•	Trade a curse for a new one (GM replaces disadvantage)
	•	Trade a secret for an escort (Scribe follows, cold help only)

If angered:
It scrapes words off the walls—all Rites in this area require twice the cost until the Scribe is destroyed.

⸻

Shortcut Node — The Book Drop

A metal hatch in the floor.
	•	Drop gear → it’s delivered safely to the Entrance on the next delve
	•	Drop a body → resurrects as an Echo Scholar on Depth 6
	•	Drop yourself → save 2 floors… or die instantly

50/50, GM rolls secretly.

⸻

✅ DEPTH 5 — The Whispered Tomes (Echoing Past)

Tone

Echoes of former delvers, memories as physical objects, and knowledge that demands payment.

Structure
	•	Entrance Node
	•	2–4 Library Nodes
	•	Breach Node
	•	Curator Node
	•	Shortcut Node

⸻

Entrance Node — The Gallery of Apologies

Portraits line the walls. Each whispers an apology as the party enters.

Each PC must roll:
	•	Success: You ignore them
	•	Mixed: One apology is meant for you
	•	Fail: You accept it and gain a Regret Token

Regret Token:
	•	Once: Reroll any failure
	•	When used: +1 Corruption and a portrait begins following you room to room

⸻

Library Node A — Echo Duelists

Two spectral scholars reenact a famous duel with paper-thin blades.

Interference triggers:
	•	Duelists turn on party
	•	Their blades cause Harm 2 (Shame)

If PCs let them finish:
	•	Gain safe passage and 1 Echo Memory (roll twice, keep best, once)

⸻

Library Node B — The Footnote Storm

A storm of tiny glowing footnotes swirls.
	•	Every spoken word becomes text in the air
	•	On a miss: text wraps around the PC, creating Binding Harm

To escape, a PC must redact one sentence from their own story.

⸻

Library Node C — The Fruit of Last Thoughts

A garden of crystalline trees. Hanging from them: memory-fruits.

Any PC may consume:
	•	Gain insight: +1 die on an upcoming scene
	•	But must reveal a painful personal truth aloud

Refusing to speak it causes:
	•	Heart-score tick: +1 Corruption
	•	Fruit screams, summoning Paper Wraiths

⸻

Breach Node — The Self-Quill

A black feather quill floats over a desk.
	•	Writing your name in its ledger → +1 Corruption, +1 Boon
	•	Writing someone else’s → trades places with them (NPC appears, PC disappears)
	•	Crossing without interacting → Desperate

⸻

Curator Node — The Hollow Librarian

A gaunt, translucent keeper.

Offers:
	•	Resurrection of a fallen PC, but as an Echo Scholar
	•	Purging all Corruption, but lose a defining Trait
	•	Map to Depth 7, but one PC becomes “Citable”

Citable:
If that PC dies, they become a permanent Annotation NPC.

⸻

Shortcut Node — The Candle Walk

A corridor with a single candle.
	•	Carrying it gives safe passage to the next depth
	•	Blowing it out sends the party back up 1d3 depths
	•	Dropping it reveals a portal to the Sealed Wing

This node kills at least one greedy party per campaign.

⸻

✅ DEPTH 6 — The Sealed Wing (Contained Void)

Tone

The Library is collapsing under The Ninth Rim. Nothing here feels alive except the Void.

Structure
	•	Entrance Node
	•	1–3 Library Nodes
	•	Breach Node
	•	Curator Node
	•	Shortcut Node

⸻

Entrance Node — The Wing with No Books

Shelves are empty. Every sound is muffled.

Corruption triggers:
	•	Speaking: +1
	•	Casting: +1
	•	Touching the shelves: +1

Clues are hidden in dust patterns and missing shapes.

Reward: A Conceptual Anchor in the dust.

⸻

Library Node A — The Pulpit of Unwriting

A lectern holding a blank book.

If opened, letters appear:
	•	PC reads a sentence aloud → something in real world vanishes
	•	GM chooses month, location, memory, small object

Temptation:
Reading your own name aloud removes 1 Corruption… permanently.

At terrible cost.

⸻

Library Node B — The Negative Pit

A hole in the floor, filled not with depth, but absence.
	•	Falling is instant death
	•	Throwing an item in: item now never existed
	•	Filling the pit with books: creates a bridge, but erases those books from the Library

Groups who try to “cheese” this discover entire scholarly fields disappear.

⸻

Library Node C — The Echo Funeral

Rows of chairs, spectral mourners watching a coffin.

The coffin contains:
	•	A future version of one PC
	•	A lost NPC
	•	Or nothing (GM choice)

Choosing to open the coffin:
	•	Grants a powerful truth
	•	Or causes the echo mourners to attack silently

⸻

Breach Node — The Vault of Holes

Doors lead nowhere. Walls end abruptly. Text vanishes as you read it.

Traveling through requires:
	•	A lie (takes you back)
	•	A truth (takes you forward)
	•	A secret (summons Void Keeper)

⸻

Curator Node — The Void Keeper

Moves like subtraction.

Offers a bargain:
	•	Erase your worst memory → remove all Corruption
	•	Erase your greatest bond → gain a powerful artifact
	•	Erase yourself from your homeland → immunity to concept damage

Fighting it:
	•	Every hit removes a detail about attacker
	•	On death: PC becomes a “Hole,” leaving a permanent absence

⸻

Shortcut Node — The Black Lift

A dumbwaiter filled with shadow.
	•	If ridden: goes directly to The Heart Chamber
	•	If something’s placed inside: it disappears forever, Breach -1

⸻

✅ THE HEART CHAMBER — IMMORTAL TRUTH

Tone

Every section of the Library overlaps. Physics, memory, rooms, and rules break. The Witness is losing.

Only ~10% of groups ever reach this.

Structure
	•	1 Entrance
	•	3 Heart Trials
	•	The Witness
	•	The Core Tome
	•	3 possible Endings

⸻

Entrance — The Room You Remember

Each player chooses a room from earlier in the delve. The GM overlays them—doors connect rooms that should not meet, items appear where they don’t belong, NPCs flicker in and out.

Everything is valid.

Heart Clock starts:
	•	Every fail or loud action → Heart +1
	•	At 6 → Ninth manifests
	•	At 10 → Core Tome opens by itself

⸻

Trial 1 — The Question You Can’t Answer

The Witness asks something the character cannot answer honestly.
	•	“Why are you really here?”
	•	“Whose death do you deserve?”
	•	“What would you unmake?”

A PC may refuse:
	•	They suffer Harm 3 (Existential Fracture)
	•	Or become Citable

A PC who answers:
	•	Gains a Revelation
	•	-1 Corruption
	•	+1 Obligation (Library)

⸻

Trial 2 — Fight Your Future

An Echo of each PC appears:
	•	Stronger, colder, more efficient

To win:
	•	PCs must refuse to become that future
	•	The fight is narrative, not HP: if a PC chooses mercy, the Echo fractures

If a PC kills their Echo:
	•	They become like it
	•	Gain a powerful boon
	•	Lose something human

⸻

Trial 3 — The Truth of Immortality

The Core Tome pulses.

Reading it reveals:
	•	Immortality = becoming reference
	•	You survive, but as a citational construct
	•	The Ninth wants release
	•	The Witness wants containment

PCs must choose:

⸻

POSSIBLE ENDINGS

✅ Ending A — Become the New Witness
	•	PCs bind the Void
	•	Gain cosmic duty
	•	Lose freedom and identity
	•	Library remains, but stable

✅ Ending B — Embrace the Ninth
	•	PCs destroy the Library
	•	Knowledge evaporates from the world
	•	Books go blank
	•	Magic changes forever

✅ Ending C — Balance

Hardest to achieve.

To do it:
	•	PCs must willingly give up something priceless:
	•	Name
	•	Memory
	•	Bond
	•	Personal truth
	•	The Library becomes finite, navigable, and mortal

This ending lets future delves exist… but every delve risks tipping the balance again.

Perfect. We’ll do A + B + D + E in a structured order so you end up with a complete, publishable module.
	•	A: Depths 2–3 (full keyed rooms, events, rewards)
	•	B: Rival Delving Parties
	•	D: Cursed Artifacts & Signature Treasures
	•	E: Factions affected by the Library

Below is the next major installment:

⸻

✅ A — Depths 2 & 3 (Fully Keyed, Deadly, OSR-style)

These go between the entry and the rooms we already built. Depth 2 introduces trust-breaking puzzles, betrayal traps, and NPC interactions. Depth 3 is where things start killing people reliably.

⸻

✅ DEPTH 2 — The Catalog Hall (Controlled Reality)

Tone: False safety, bureaucratic traps, order that hides predation

Structure
	•	Entrance Node
	•	2–4 Library Nodes
	•	Curator Node
	•	Breach Node
	•	Shortcut Node

⸻

Entrance Node — The Clerk of Silence

A hunched figure behind a podium, blindfolded, writing with furious speed.

It cannot hear. It can only read lips.

If anyone speaks aloud:
	•	+1 Noise
	•	Clerk rings a small bell → Wandering encounter immediate

If PCs whisper or sign:
	•	Clerk asks for a Statement of Purpose.
	•	Honest → Advantage on next Investigate
	•	Lies → Paper Wraith spawns behind them later

The Clerk stamps passports:
	•	“Visitor” (neutral)
	•	“Donor” (treasure + Debt)
	•	“Volunteer” (you’ll regret it)

⸻

Library Node A — The Catalogue Hounds

Smoky dogs made of ink and shredded index cards. They hunt misfilers.

PCs who used deception, forged documents, or altered records:
	•	Enter Desperate Position
	•	Hounds have scent of lies: +1 die to track anyone who spoke falsely this delve

Killing a Hound:
	•	It scatters into paper scraps revealing a hidden corridor
	•	That shortcut leads deeper… but skips loot
	•	And a new Hound spawns every 3 turns thereafter

⸻

Library Node B — The Reference Spiral

A gently sloping spiral ramp that seems endless.

Every 90 seconds:
	•	PCs must declare what knowledge they seek
	•	If declared truthfully → spiral recedes
	•	If lied → spiral loops them back to start with +1 Corruption

Treasure:
Wall niche contains Annotated Compass (once: “point to the truest way”)

Curse:
It permanently points toward the thing that will ruin you.

⸻

Library Node C — The Helpful Map

A charming little paper map with a smiley face.
It talks. It gives directions. It lies.

Mechanics:
	•	First time used: safe shortcut
	•	Second time: leads to Breach node
	•	Third time: leads into Ink Tide or Negative Pit in later depths

Bargain:
	•	Shred it → +1 Breach
	•	Fold it → becomes a paper crane that scouts one room ahead

⸻

Curator Node — The Bone Custodian

Polite skeleton in a librarian tabard.

Offers:
	•	Return stolen books → remove 1 Corruption
	•	Donate a PC memory → reveals secret shortcut
	•	Register a “New Volume” (write your name) → gain +1 Boon now, become Citable

Fighting it:
	•	Each hit dislodges bone fragments spelling accusations
	•	Killing it → shelves collapse → escape becomes harder

⸻

Breach Node — The Error Page

A blank white wall with a blinking cursor.

If touched:
	•	Wall fills with text describing the PC’s future
	•	The future is dark, but true

PC may redact a line:
	•	Erases that future
	•	+1 Corruption

Leaving without interaction:
	•	Next room is haunted by a Hostile Echo of the PC

⸻

Shortcut Node — Return Bin

A big metal chute marked “Returns Only”
	•	Toss an item → teleports back to Entrance
	•	Toss a corpse → resurrects as Paper Wraith
	•	Toss yourself → return to Entrance safely, lose one memory forever

Players will absolutely try it.

⸻

✅ DEPTH 3 — The Misfiled Vault (Paper, Bone, Teeth)

Tone: False logic, word traps, illusions that bite

Structure
	•	Entrance
	•	2–5 rooms
	•	Breach Node
	•	Curator Node
	•	Shortcut Node

⸻

Entrance — The Thesis Gate

A door that demands justification.

To pass, a PC must:
	•	State why they deserve knowledge
	•	Roll Presence or Wits

Success → Door opens
Partial → Opens but demands Citation (something valuable given)
Fail → Door opens, but something behind them dies
(Always pick a follower, item, or memory)

⸻

Room A — The Paper Guillotines

Looks like a normal reading room.

Invisible hair-thin tripwires:
	•	Cross without searching: Harm 3
	•	Spot by dust patterns and faint breeze

Solving:
	•	Roll Awareness
	•	Or sacrifice something large (table, armor)
	•	Or crawl (Position lowered, but safe)

Treasure:
	•	Void Vellum tucked in a lectern

⸻

Room B — Scriptorium of Screams

Parchment drying on racks.
Some pages have faces.

Touching a page:
	•	It screams
	•	+1 Noise
	•	Wakes Tome Mimic

Burning pages:
	•	Clears safe path
	•	+1 Corruption

⸻

Room C — The Footnote Trap

Tiny footnotes crawl like insects.

They attach to PCs:
	•	Each reduces 1 skill die until removed
	•	Removing requires truth: PC must admit a personal flaw aloud

⸻

Breach Node — Misindexed Portal

A door labeled “Atlas.”
Actually leads to the Sealed Wing.

If forced open:
	•	All written notes PCs carry unwrite themselves

If carefully re-filed:
	•	Reveal secret ladder down to Depth 5
	•	But PCs gain Library Debt (Obligation +1)

⸻

Curator Node — The Shattered Clerk

Half-finished automaton built of bone, ink, and quills.

Offers one:
	•	Return a lost memory
	•	Catalog a fear (PC becomes immune to it)
	•	Create a new “rule” the Library follows

Prices always hidden.

⸻

Shortcut Node — Dumbwaiter of Regrets

Small lift with space for a single PC
	•	Ride alone: skip to Depth 4 safely
	•	Ride with someone: lift jams, both trapped, Wandering Encounter
	•	Send an item: comes back cursed OR blessed (GM chooses)

⸻

⸻

✅ B — RIVAL DELVING PARTIES

Each is designed to be:
	•	A complication

⸻

⸻

✅ D — CURSED ARTIFACTS & SIGNATURE TREASURE

These items are useful, but always demand payment.

⸻

Curse:
Always points toward the PC whose story is closest to ending.

⸻

The Echo Shard records your voice.
Someday, it answers a question in your voice when you aren’t there.

Curse:
You now see all the ways people might die.

⸻

⸻

✅ E — FACTIONS AFFECTED BY THE LIBRARY

These turn the dungeon into a campaign engine.

⸻

Publicly denies rumors. Secretly trying to weaponize knowledge.

	•	Magic destabilizes

⸻

Scholar-cult believing the Library is a divine test

Goal: Reach Heart Chamber and become immortal as texts

They will die horribly.

⸻

5. The Watch of Thepyrgos

City guard—overwhelmed, clueless, terrified

Goal: Stop disappearances
Tactics: Patrols, checkpoints, arrests

If PCs cause too much noise, the Watch seals the Library entrance with guards and mages… making future delves harder.

Perfect. We’ll deliver:

✅ (2) Faction Missions & Adventure Hooks
✅ (3) Full Rival Party Stat Blocks (Fate’s Edge format)
✅ (5) The Tome of Immortal Truth—artifact, mechanics, consequences

All written to be plug-and-play for a GM during campaign prep.

✅ (5) THE TOME OF IMMORTAL TRUTH

Artifact • Depth 7–Heart Chamber only

Appearance:
A massive book whose pages are made of living white vellum, blank until someone touches it.
As soon as skin meets page, it begins writing the reader’s life.

Activation

To open the tome, a PC must:
	•	Speak their true name
	•	Place a drop of blood
	•	Make a Resolve roll (DV 4)

If They Pass

The Tome reveals:
	•	Their death
	•	Their true destiny

	•	Immune to illusion for 1 scene per delve

	•	Lose a Belief, Bond, or Background trait permanently
	•	Take Corruption +2
	•	Suffer Conceptual Erosion: +1 Breach

⸻

If They Read It All

They become Immortal, but not alive.

Their consciousness is copied into the Library:
	•	Their body dies or vanishes
	•	They become a Living Annotation
	•	PCs may consult them once per session as a powerful oracle

Mechanics of Immortality:
	•	You exist as a book that can be read, stolen, or destroyed
	•	If destroyed, you vanish utterly
	•	If carried, you whisper advice
	•	If returned to Heart Chamber, you manifest physically for one final scene

⸻

If The Tome Is Destroyed

	•	Witness’s Symbol
	•	Void Vellum
	•	A willing soul

	•	The Library collapses inward
	•	Each PC chooses one:

	•	Remove a curse
	•	Restore a lost memory or loved one

Cost:
	•	Containment Breach +10
	•	Whatever comes next is worse

⸻

If The Tome Is Stolen

The Library becomes furious:
	•	Every Wandering result for remainder of campaign = Hostile
	•	Paper Wraiths spawn without noise
	•	The Void Keeper leaves the Sealed Wing
	•	Rival factions hunt the PCs to control it

The Tome whispers:
	•	Secrets
	•	Lies
	•	Temptations

It becomes a campaign villain.

Absolutely. Depths 4–5 are where the Forbidden Library stops behaving like a place and starts behaving like a mind. These levels should feel unfair-but-fair: high pressure, immense rewards, permanent scars. Think: “We must make choices, or choices will be made about us.”

We’ll present them in Fate’s Edge format with room generators, wandering tables, setpieces, treasure, and clocks.

⸻

✅ DEPTH 4 — THE WHISPERED TOMES

“The Library remembers everything spoken here. And it speaks back.”

How Depth 4 Works
	•	Speech gains weight. Any lie spoken in Depth 4 becomes a wandering threat next scene.
	•	Names are dangerous. Speaking a true name invites a Whispered Tome to attack that person.
	•	Reality negotiates. Rooms bargain. Text bargains. Voices bargain.

⸻

✅ ROOM GENERATOR (Depth 4)

Roll 2d6 per new Zone:

2d6	The Room Is…	Premise	Pressure	Puzzle/Protocol	Price	Payout

7	Reference Spiral	Infinite stairs of footnotes	Each step misquotes you	Correct the misquote	Gain Obligation: Library	Sealed Sigil
8	Arguing Tomes	Books scream at each other	Their lies infect PCs	Resolve a debate logically	Lose 1 Voice scene	Gain 1 permanent Info Tag
9	Frozen Study	Time fragmented	Actions repeat	Break loop with sacrifice	Burn gear or Fatigue	Time-skip Clue
10	Ink Golems	Constructed librarians	They enforce silence	Beat them without noise	Harm or lose item	Silent Passage
11	Forgotten Wing	Discarded realities	Rules are Improv	Accept a paradox	Gain Corruption 2	Reality Knife
12	Grey Scribe’s Court	Being judged	Scribe asks for “meaning”	Speak your thesis	Lose Belief	Oracle-page

Cost Options (choose one):
	•	Destroy a treasured book
	•	Give up a skill point (cannot be restored without a ritual)
	•	Sacrifice a memory of someone beloved

Benefit:
	•	The party can bypass 1 encounter and reach Depth 5 safely
	•	Each PC gains a Fragment of Truth (once: turn a miss into mixed result)

BUT:
The Library learns what hurts them.

Next delve, it targets whoever sacrificed most.

⸻

✅ REWARDS IN DEPTH 4
	•	Tome-Shard: Once, cast a Rite with —1 Corruption
	•	Oracle-Page: Ask a yes/no question; the GM must answer truthfully
	•	Reality Knife: Can cut books, bonds, illusions, and occasionally truth
	•	Sealed Sigil: Prevents one name-based attack or curse
	•	Echo Ink: Turns lies into visible glyphs

✅ DEPTH 5 — THE SEALED WING

“Words die here. Names unravel. Shadows have rules you do not.”

How Depth 5 Works
	•	No spoken language functions.
PCs communicate via signs, writing, gestures, or pain.
	•	Void Effects escalate:
Any 1 on a roll counts twice.
	•	Gear is at risk:
Ink, paper, scrolls, maps—everything written is eaten.

⸻

⸻

✅ DEPTH 5 EXIT → HEART CHAMBER

The final door only opens if:
	•	A PC has offered true sacrifice
AND
	•	The party carries a forbidden secret, a stolen book, or a Memory Core

If not, the Library seals them in a recursive loop of Depths 3–5 until someone breaks.

Perfect. We’ll build (1) the Heart Chamber, then (2) legacy mechanics, then (4) rival parties, then (5) Library Fights Back escalation—all tuned to keep the Forbidden Library feeling like a campaign-scale antagonist that remembers.

⸻

✅ (1) FINAL LEVEL — THE HEART CHAMBER

“Here, knowledge is not written. It writes you.”

What the Heart Chamber Is

The core of the Library’s dimensional paradox:
	•	A collapsed space made from every previous Zone at once
	•	The final battlefield between The Witness and The Ninth Rim
	•	A choice engine, not a room

Time, position, and identity are unstable. PCs’ past choices become terrain and threats.

Entering the Heart

Upon entering, resolve all 3 steps:
	1.	Reality Fracture (Group Test)
	•	Each PC rolls a core skill with —1 die
	•	Every failure: +1 Knowledge Corruption
	•	Any PC who hits Corruption 8 begins to fade and can speak only via written notes
	2.	The Library Reveals Itself
The party learns, in unambiguous terms:
	•	The Forbidden Library is a prison for dangerous knowledge
	•	The Witness maintains the prison, but at the cost of souls
	•	The Ninth Rim wants to erase the prison and the knowledge inside
The true “immortality” rumor is a trap: you persist only as reference, not will.
	3.	The Choice Becomes Physical
The chamber splits into three overlapping realities—the party must pick which one they interact with each beat:
A. The Witness’s Realm (Containment)
	•	Calm, cold, geometric
	•	Voices echo like courtroom testimony
	•	Action types: Logic, negotiation, sacrifice
B. The Ninth’s Realm (Erasure)
	•	Black shelves with books as holes
	•	Words peel off when spoken
	•	Action types: Defiance, destruction, deception
C. The Third Path (Rewriting)
	•	Pages blank, waiting
	•	Truths float as pure symbols
	•	Action types: Creation, empathy, compromise

Players decide which reality their actions target each beat.
Choices drive the Final Clock below.

⸻

THE FINAL CLOCK: FATE OF THE LIBRARY [6]

Tick 1 each beat, plus:

Trigger	Extra Ticks
A PC dies	+1
Reality Fracture	+1
Void Keeper arrives	+1
Deal made with Witness	—1
Deal made with Ninth	—2
Sacrifice for rewriting	—2

When it hits 6, resolve based on what path they followed most.

If Containment Dominates
	•	PCs save the Library
	•	Those who reached Corruption 5+ become bound annotations: alive, but only as whispering texts
	•	Survivors gain The Witness’s Mark:
	•	Cannot lie
	•	Immune to charm/mental control
	•	NPCs sense the truth in their voice and fear it

If Erasure Dominates
	•	Library erased
	•	Knowledge lost to void
	•	PCs marked for life: The Ninth’s Hunger
	•	Immune to information overload
	•	Must consume secrets (GM compels)
	•	Gain +1 die on any forbidden knowledge check

If Rewriting Dominates
	•	PCs reshape the library into something new
	•	Truth and danger balanced
	•	Gain Title: Curator of the Third Path
	•	Once per session, rewrite a minor truth in a scene
	•	Once per campaign, rewrite a major truth at terrible cost
	•	The Library becomes a living ally—but unpredictable

⸻

SETPIECE: THE FINAL BARGAIN

When the Final Clock hits 3 or when a PC dies, The Witness and The Ninth speak directly to a chosen PC:

The Witness offers:
	•	Containment, safety, eternal vigilance
	•	Cost: One PC must become a book
	•	Benefit: Party escapes safely with treasure and knowledge

The Ninth offers:
	•	Freedom, destruction, liberation
	•	Cost: Lose a belief, bond, or identity trait permanently
	•	Benefit: Gain void-forged power

The Third Path requires:
	•	Proof the PCs understand both
	•	A sacrifice freely offered
	•	Something meaningful given up without coercion

Only one can resolve the Library.

⸻

✅ (2) LEGACY MECHANICS (POST-DELVES)

The Forbidden Library remembers everyone who enters it.

After each delve, PCs roll Legacy (1d6):

Roll	What Happens
1	A creature or librarian remembers them—sends a problem
2–3	They bring back a scar: flaw, obsession, fear
4–5	They bring back a treasure: forbidden page, memory shard
6	They bring back a truth: GM gives a deeply uncomfortable, actionable revelation about the world or campaign


⸻

✅ Legacy Scars (pick or roll 1d8)
	1.	Memory leak (forget 1 ally’s name until reminded)
	2.	Echo Speech (sometimes repeat dead scholars’ voices)
	3.	Truth addiction (cannot let lies stand without Stress)
	4.	Sleepless (nightmares whisper pages)
	5.	Paper-thin (fear of books and writing)
	6.	Archivist’s Mark (ink stains that move)
	7.	Shadowed Sight (see void where knowledge is missing)
	8.	The Library Calls (dreams of shelves demand return)

⸻

✅ Legacy Treasures (1d8)
	1.	Echo Shard (downgrade lethal to Harm 2)
	2.	Truth Vellum (write 1 perfect forgery)
	3.	Codex Spine (turn any book into a key)
	4.	Conceptual Anchor (ignore 1 erosion effect)
	5.	Memory Core (restore 1 forgotten thing)
	6.	Oracle-Page (one true yes/no)
	7.	Shadow Key (open unseen passage)
	8.	Index Eye (ask GM “what’s the most dangerous thing here?”)

⸻

✅ (4) RIVAL PARTY SYSTEM

The Library is big enough for more than one group—and rivals make things OSR-dangerous.

How Rivals Enter

When PCs:
	•	take too long,
	•	trigger too many Breach ticks,
	•	or steal treasure the Library wants back…

Roll Rival Presence (1d6) each delve:

| 1–2 | Rivals are one layer ahead |
| 3–4 | Rivals are one layer behind |
| 5   | Rivals enter mid-delve |
| 6   | Rival survivors return—and they’ve changed |

⸻

Rival Party Examples

The Annotated Order
	•	Scholar-knights hunting immortality
	•	Will ally briefly, then betray

The Broken Choir
	•	Ex-Cantors of Lunara
	•	Silence everything they witness

The Bound Scribes
	•	Servants of the Witness
	•	Treat PCs as “loose pages” to be filed

Each has:
	•	a Goal,
	•	a Weakness,
	•	and a horrible Fate if they reach the Heart first.

⸻

Rival Actions (1d6 per delve)
	1.	Steal the treasure PCs wanted
	2.	Trigger a trap in the next Zone
	3.	Leave warnings (lies or truths)
	4.	Attack directly
	5.	Bargain with the Library
	6.	Die horribly, leaving clues and gear

⸻

✅ (5) LIBRARY FIGHTS BACK TABLES

After every delve, roll 1d10:

d10	The Library Does…
1	Sends a Paper Wraith after a liar
2	Erases a minor NPC from memory
3	“Corrects” a map the party relies on
4	Enforces silence in a safehouse
5	Sends a Bone Custodian with a “bill”
6	Dreams of shelves haunt a PC (Stress 2)
7	A beloved book loses its words
8	A PC’s spellbook goes blank (temporary)
9	A rival party asks for help—they’re trapped
10	The Witness or the Ninth appears in visions—demanding the PCs return

Every time a 10 is rolled, increase the Library’s Reach.
When Reach hits 3, the Library can:
	•	consume a building,
	•	silence a town,
	•	erase a historic event.

This ties the dungeon into the campaign’s world.
