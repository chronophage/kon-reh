\begin{longtable}{@{}ll}
    \textbf{Premise:} & The legendary Crimson Codex, containing every secret of Ecktoria's elite, has been stolen, causing cascading social collapse as magically enforced oaths break \\
    \textbf{Theme:} & Political intrigue, social collapse, and the power of truth \\
    \textbf{Focus:} & Social \& Investigation \\
    \textbf{Combat:} & Low Combat Optional \\
    \textbf{Length:} & One-Shot \\
\end{longtable}

\section*{Premise \& Tone}
In the marble forums of Ecktoria, where the Utaran Empire's ghosts still echo through colonnaded halls, the city's greatest scandal isn't political—it's literary. The Crimson Codex, a legendary book of forbidden knowledge said to contain every secret, every lie, and every truth that could destroy the city's elite, has been stolen from the Library of Keys.

But this isn't just any theft. The Codex was bound in oaths—literally. Each page was a magically enforced secret, kept by the weight of sworn vows. Now those oaths are breaking, and as they do, Ecktoria's power structure is crumbling. Senators confess to treason in their sleep, merchants reveal the locations of their hidden vaults, and the High Priest of the Everflame begins preaching heretical sermons about the "true" history of the Empire.

\section*{The Hook}
The PCs are hired by Livaea, the Crimson Courtier, to recover the Codex before the city tears itself apart. But Livaea has her own agenda—the Codex contains the location of the Red Branch, a splinter faction of the old Utaran nobility who vanished centuries ago but may hold the key to restoring the Empire.

The twist? The theft was orchestrated by Inaea, Angel of the Spider, working through a network of blackmail victims who finally found the courage to fight back. The breaking oaths aren't a bug—they're a feature. And the Codex is writing itself as it's read, with each secret revealed adding new pages of devastating truths.

\section*{Fronts \& Clocks}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Secrets Unbound [6/8]}

\section*{The Crimson Codex - Mechanics}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Reading the Codex}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk:} Wits + Arcana DV 4. On failure, generate 1 SB. On partial, choose one:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reveal truth but mark 1 Fatigue
        \item Gain insight but generate 1 SB (Diamonds)
        \item Learn secret but mark 1 SB (Hearts)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rewards:} Successful reading grants:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item +1d to Investigation about related topics
        \item One specific truth about target NPC/faction
        \item Advantage on social rolls against target (once)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Codex Backlash Table}
When reading fails or generates SB, roll 1d6:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Your secret revealed to nearby NPCs
    \item Target of your investigation becomes aware
    \item Patron (Livaea or Inaea) gains leverage over you
    \item New complication clock starts (2-4 segments)
    \item Harm 1 (Mental stress from forbidden knowledge)
    \item Gain permanent Condition: Truth-Sensitive (-1d to deception)
\end{enumerate}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\section*{Investigation and Social Challenges}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{The Web of Oaths}
Create a visual map of key NPCs and connections:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Political (red lines)
    \item Financial (gold lines)
    \item Romantic (pink lines)
    \item Blackmail (black lines with arrows)
\end{itemize}
As oaths break, lines snap or change color. Players can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sever} (Inaea): Cut one connection, but generate 1 SB
    \item \textbf{Reinforce} (Livaea): Strengthen one connection, but mark 1 Obligation
    \item \textbf{Redirect:} Change target of connection, but require Wits + Sway test
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\section*{Potential Twists}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{The Red Branch's True Agenda}
The exiled nobles aren't returning to restore the Empire—they want to reclaim their lost artifacts and disappear again, using the chaos as cover. The Codex might be their key to finding these items.

\textbf{Reveal:} When PCs investigate the Red Branch, they discover plans for a "quiet extraction" rather than a glorious return.
\end{mechanicsbox}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{The Chosen Voice}
The High Priest isn't mad; she's been chosen by the Codex itself to be its voice, preaching the "truth" it contains.

\textbf{Reveal:} During a religious ceremony, her eyes turn crimson when reading from any text, and she speaks prophecies that later prove true.
\end{mechanicsbox}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Personal Secrets}
A PC's own secret is contained within the Codex. Reading it or being near it causes them to involuntarily reveal it, or grants the Patron leverage over them.

\textbf{Implementation:} Each PC writes down one secret during character creation. When Codex Rewriting advances, GM may reveal one PC secret.
\end{mechanicsbox}

\section*{GM Guidance}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Running the City}
Make Ecktoria feel alive by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describing changing atmospheres in districts
    \item Having NPCs react differently based on district state
    \item Using the Secrets Unbound clock to trigger district shifts
    \item Letting player actions have visible consequences on city mood
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Patron Balance}
Present both Patrons' offers as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Equally tempting within their frameworks
    \item Logically consistent with their natures
    \item Carrying clear, immediate costs
    \item Leading to different long-term consequences
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{Social Combat}
Treat social encounters like combat:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Establish clear stakes and consequences
    \item Use Position to reflect social advantage
    \item Let clocks drive escalating tension
    \item Reward creative solutions and roleplay
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\section*{Character Integration}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{For Runekeepers}
The abundance of oaths and secrets makes Oath-based Rites incredibly potent:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Binding Vow:} Stabilize crumbling alliances
    \item \textbf{Mark of Antlers:} Grant temporary authority in chaos
    \item \textbf{Revelation:} Pierce illusions but risk unwanted truths
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{For Cantors}
The Cantor's Path can be used to "sing" truths or lies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hymn of Truth:} Force honesty in social encounters (+1 Effect)
    \item \textbf{Song of Lies:} Create convincing deceptions (+1d to Deception)
    \item \textbf{Chorus of Unity:} Calm conflicts (+1 Position to peacemaking)
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}

\begin{mechanicsbox}{For Invokers}
Ritual magic excels at investigation and information gathering:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reveal Rites:} Expose hidden connections or concealed truths
    \item \textbf{Ward Rites:} Protect against unwanted revelations
    \item \textbf{Command Rites:} Compel truth from unwilling sources
\end{itemize}
\end{mechanicsbox}
