\section{Session 0: Personalizing Your Exile}

Before beginning play, take time to establish the connections between your characters and their shared past in Silkstrand. Discuss these questions with the group:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The Final Straw:} What was the specific event in Silkstrand that forced you all to leave \textit{together}?
\item \textbf{Defining Moment:} Look at your Mutual Bonds. Briefly describe the scene where that bond was formed. Was it during the event that exiled you, or on the road afterward?
\item \textbf{A Sliver of Hope:} Why is Millhaven different? What about this place makes you want to fight for it, instead of just moving on?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example for Kestra and Marcus:} Their bond is "We both made choices that cost us our place." Perhaps Marcus refused an order to arrest Kestra during the library incident, sacrificing his career to help her escape.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Welcome to Acasia}

Welcome to Fate's Edge, where every choice carries weight and every action has consequences. This starter adventure, "Blood and Silk," is designed to introduce new players to the core mechanics of the game while telling a story about redemption, community, and the power of second chances.

In the broken marches of Acasia, where law is a suggestion and coin speaks louder than crowns, a group of exiles finds themselves in a small farming village called Millhaven. What starts as a simple misunderstanding quickly escalates into a fight for survival as the village faces threats from all sides.

\subsection{Adventure Overview}

\textbf{Adventure Hook:} The PCs are exiles from Silkstrand - a cosmopolitan port city where they made choices that cost them their place in society. Now they wander the broken roads of Acasia, trying to survive and perhaps find a place where they belong.

\textbf{Setting:} Millhaven, a small farming village in the Acasian marches, threatened by bandits and political machinations.

\textbf{Themes:} Redemption, community, second chances, and the power of belonging.

\textbf{Tone:} Gritty but hopeful. Violence has consequences, but heroism can earn respect and a place to call home.

\textbf{Recommended Character Tier:} Rookie (0-40 XP) - perfect for new players.

\textbf{Estimated Play Time:} 2-3 sessions

\section{The Story So Far}

\subsection{The Exiles of Silkstrand}

The PCs are not welcome in their former home of Silkstrand. Whether they were involved in a scandal, crossed the wrong person, or simply made choices that powerful people didn't like, they now find themselves on the outside looking in. With nothing but the clothes on their backs and a burning desire to prove themselves, they've taken to the roads of Acasia.

\subsection{Millhaven: A Village in Peril}

Millhaven is a small farming community that has managed to stay neutral in the endless conflicts of Acasia. The villagers are simple folk who want nothing more than to tend their fields and raise their families in peace. But peace is a luxury that's becoming increasingly expensive.

The village is currently under threat from:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bandits:} The Rothari Gang, a particularly vicious group that demands "protection money"
\item \textbf{Political Pressure:} Local nobles who want the village to choose sides in their conflicts
\item \textbf{Economic Hardship:} Poor harvests and bandit raids have left the village struggling
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Campaign Clocks}

This adventure uses simplified campaign clocks to track the overall progress of the story:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tableheader}
\textbf{Village Safety Clock} & \textbf{How close the village is to being overrun} \\
\hline
Segments & \textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet 0/6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tableheader}
\textbf{Rothari Threat Clock} & \textbf{How much the Rothari Gang is organizing against the village} \\
\hline
Segments & \textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet 0/8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Clock Advancement}

\textbf{Village Safety Clock:}
\begin{itemize}
\item PCs fail to protect villagers: +2 segments
\item Rothari successfully intimidate villagers: +1 segment
\item PCs successfully protect villagers: -1 segment (minimum 0)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rothari Threat Clock:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Direct confrontation with Rothari: +2 segments
\item Rothari casualties: +1 segment
\item PCs gain information about Rothari plans: -1 segment
\item PCs successfully intimidate Rothari: -2 segments

\item Fought the Rothari Gang
\item Learned about the village's troubles
\item Made enemies of the Rothari (Rothari Threat Clock advances)
\item Either protected or endangered the village (Village Safety Clock changes accordingly)
\end{itemize}

\section{Session 2: The Village Fights Back}

\subsection{Opening Scene: The Strategic Crossroads}

Garrick's retaliation has made it clear the village cannot simply wait to be attacked. Elder Thorne and the PCs must decide on a primary strategy. Present the players with a clear choice that will define the rest of the adventure:

\textbf{Option A: Fortify and Hold}
The village will focus on building defenses: palisades, traps, and a militia.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Primary Asset Gained:} \textit{Village Militia}
\item \textbf{Primary Challenge:} Resource scarcity and maintaining morale during the siege.
\item \textbf{Session 2 Focus:} Defense-oriented encounters (building traps, training militia, withstanding probing attacks).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Option B: Strike First}
The village's best chance is to take the fight to the Rothari, targeting their camp or a key lieutenant.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Primary Asset Gained:} \textit{Scouting Reports} (grants a bonus to the final battle)
\item \textbf{Primary Challenge:} The danger of the expedition and leaving the village lightly defended.
\item \textbf{Session 2 Focus:} Offensive-oriented encounters (scouting, ambushing supply lines, a raid on a bandit outpost).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mechanical Impact:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The chosen strategy sets the \textbf{primary tone and encounters} for Session 2.
\item The \textit{other} strategy becomes a \textbf{secondary clock} that can still be advanced with good rolls, representing limited efforts on that front.
\item This choice makes the players feel they are directing the narrative, not just reacting to it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Consequences of the Choice}

\textbf{If Fortify and Hold:}
\begin{itemize}
\item PCs work with villagers to build palisades and traps
\item Rothari make probing attacks to test defenses
\item Elder Thorne provides tactical guidance
\item Tom the Smith helps forge weapons for the militia
\end{itemize}

\textbf{If Strike First:}
\begin{itemize}
\item PCs lead a scouting mission into Rothari territory

\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Session 3: The Final Stand}

\subsection{Opening Scene: The Rothari Return}

Garrick Rothari has had enough. He gathers all his forces for one final assault on Millhaven, determined to make an example of the village and anyone who dares to oppose him.

\textbf{The Final Threat:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Overwhelming Numbers:} 20+ Rothari bandits
\item \textbf{Siege Tactics:} Rothari attempt to cut off supplies and starve the village out

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Simplified Mass Combat}

For the final battle, use this simplified system:

\textbf{Village Defense Clock (6 segments):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Represents how well the village holds out against the assault
\item Advances when PCs fail rolls or make tactical errors
\item Retreats when PCs succeed or make good choices
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rothari Morale Clock (8 segments):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Represents how close the Rothari are to breaking and running
\item Advances when PCs deal damage or intimidate enemies
\item Retreats when Rothari succeed in their attacks
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Combat Resolution:}
\begin{itemize}
\item PCs make rolls to lead the defense (Presence + Command)
\item PCs make rolls to fight individual enemies (Body + Melee)
\item PCs make rolls to protect villagers (Various skills)
\item Success advances Rothari Morale Clock, failure advances Village Defense Clock
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Session 3 Resolution}

If the PCs successfully defend the village:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rothari Morale Clock fills - the gang breaks and flees
\item Village Safety Clock resets to 0
\item PCs gain permanent Assets reflecting their heroism
\item PCs may be offered a permanent place in the village
\end{itemize}

\section{Core Mechanics Quick Reference}

\subsection{Making Rolls}

In Fate's Edge, you resolve important actions by rolling dice:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Determine the Approach:} Choose an Attribute + Skill combination
\item \textbf{Set Difficulty:} GM sets Difficulty Value (DV) from 1-4+
\item \textbf{Roll Dice:} Roll a number of d10s equal to Attribute + Skill
\item \textbf{Count Results:}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Each 6+ = 1 Success
   \item Each 1 = 1 Complication Point (CP)
   \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Apply Outcome:} Compare successes to DV
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Outcome Matrix}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Result} & \textbf{Successes vs DV} & \textbf{Effect} \\
\hline
Clean Success & S $\geq$ DV, 0 CP & Intent achieved crisply \\
Success \& Cost & S $\geq$ DV, 1+ CP & Intent achieved, GM spends CP \\
Partial & 0 $<$ S $<$ DV & Progress with fork \\
Miss & S = 0 & No progress, GM spends CP \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Complication Points (CP)}

CP are narrative fuel that the GM spends to add complications:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{1 CP:} Minor pressure (noise, trace, +1 Supply segment)
\item \textbf{2 CP:} Moderate setback (alarm, lose position, lesser foe)
\item \textbf{3 CP:} Serious trouble (reinforcements, gear breaks, rail tick)
\item \textbf{4+ CP:} Major turn (trap springs, authority arrives, scene shifts)
\end{itemize}

\section{Resource Management}

\subsection{Boons}

Boons are narrative tokens representing luck, resilience, or growth:
\begin{itemize}

   \item Re-roll one die after seeing the pool
   \item Activate an Off-Screen Asset (1 Boon)
   \item Convert 2 Boons $\rightarrow$ 1 XP (once per session)
   \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Limit:} Maximum 5 Boons at once

\begin{mechanic}{Villain Motivations: Garrick Rothari}

Choose one primary and one secondary motivation to give Garrick depth:

\textbf{Primary Motivations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Abandoned Soldier:} Garrick was once a decorated Acasian soldier, discharged without pension after losing an arm in service. He turned to banditry to survive and now targets villages under the protection of the nobles who betrayed him.
\item \textbf{The Debt Slave:} Garrick is being coerced by a Silkstrand crime lord (perhaps connected to a PC's backstory) to extract a massive debt from Millhaven. His cruelty is born of desperation.
\item \textbf{The Ideologue:} Garrick genuinely believes the strong should rule the weak. He sees his "protection" as a natural order and views the villagers' defiance as a violation of the rightful way of things.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Secondary Traits:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Code of Honor:} He never harms children and always keeps his word.
\item \textbf{Sentimental:} He carries a tattered locket with a portrait of a lost loved one.
\item \textbf{Intellectually Curious:} He has a surprising respect for learning and might spare Kestra if she impresses him with her knowledge.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{GM Application:} Weave the chosen motivation into the story. For example, if using "The Abandoned Soldier," the PCs might find an old Acasian military insignia on a bandit, leading to a revelation that reframes the conflict.

\section{Optional Complications}

\subsection{Adding Depth}

If your group wants more complexity, you can add these elements:

\begin{mechanic}{Political Intrigue: The Baron's Gambit}

For a more complex game, introduce \textbf{Baroness Valerius}, a local noble whose lands border Millhaven's.

\textbf{Her Motive:} She wants to annex Millhaven for its fertile land but cannot do so openly. She has been secretly undermining the village, including \textit{sabotaging their requests for aid} and \textit{encouraging the Rothari} (via intermediaries) to soften them up.

\textbf{How it Unfolds:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Clue:} In Session 1, a bandit carries a coin from the Baroness's mint.
\item \textbf{Development:} In Session 2, a "helpful" envoy from the Baroness arrives, offering protection in exchange for swearing fealty—a blatant power grab.
\item \textbf{Confrontation:} In Session 3, if the PCs are winning, the Baroness might send her own troops under the pretext of "restoring order," aiming to claim the victory and the village.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{New Mechanics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Baroness's Scheme Clock (6):} Tracks her progress toward annexing the village. It advances if the PCs trust her envoy or are weakened by the Rothari.
\item \textbf{New Asset:} \textit{Evidence of Conspiracy (Minor)}: If the PCs uncover proof of her dealings with the Rothari, they can use it to discredit her.
\end{itemize}

\end{mechanic}

\textbf{Supernatural Elements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Rothari are using cursed weapons
\item Ancient spirits are awakened by the violence
\item One of the PCs has a mystical connection to the area
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Personal Stakes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A PC's family member is in the village
\item The Rothari leader knows one of the PCs personally
\item Villagers remind PCs of people from their past
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scaling the Challenge}

\textbf{For Experienced Players:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Increase clock sizes by 2 segments each
\item Add more Rothari bandits to encounters
\item Introduce additional factions with competing interests
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For New Players:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Decrease clock sizes by 2 segments each
\item Provide more obvious clues and hints
\item Reduce the number of Rothari in combat encounters
\end{itemize}

\section{Resolution and Continuation}

\subsection{Successful Defense}

If the PCs successfully defend Millhaven:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Immediate Rewards:}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Permanent Assets reflecting their heroism
   \item 10-12 XP for each player
   \item Respect and gratitude from the villagers
   \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Long-term Benefits:}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Millhaven becomes a safe base of operations
   \item Villagers provide information and resources
   \item Other communities seek their help
   \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Story Hooks:}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Other villages face similar threats
   \item Rothari remnants seek revenge
   \item Political forces take notice of the PCs
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Village Falls: A Road to Redemption}

If the Rothari Threat Clock fills or the Village Safety Clock reaches its end, Millhaven is overrun. But this is not the end—it's a turning point.

\textbf{Immediate Aftermath:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The PCs escape with a small group of survivors (including key NPCs like Mira the Baker and Tom the Smith).
\item Each player gains a new \textbf{Bond of Shared Trauma} with another PC: "We failed together, and we will atone together."
\item The \textbf{Refugee Caravan (Minor Asset)} is automatically gained, representing the survivors and their scant resources.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Redemption Arc - Choose Your Path:}
The survivors look to the PCs for leadership. Present the group with a clear choice for their next goal:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Seek Sanctuary in Vhasia:} A duchy in Vhasia to the east might offer protection, but gaining entry will require proving their worth and navigating strict bureaucracy. (Shifts the campaign to a political/intrigue theme).
\item \textbf{Appeal to the Acasian "Nobility":} Confront the local rulers whose inaction allowed the Rothari to thrive. This is dangerous and could see the PCs framed as scapegoats. (Shifts the campaign to a social/judicial theme).
\item \textbf{Become Guerrillas:} Stay in the region, harassing Rothari supply lines and freeing other villages from the shadows. The Rothari become a persistent \textbf{Hunt Clock} pursuing them. (Shifts the campaign to a military/insurgency theme).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{New Campaign Clocks for the Arc:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Refugee Morale (6):} Tracks the hope and cohesion of the survivors. Filling it grants a boon; emptying it causes desertions.
\item \textbf{Rothari Hunt (8):} Tracks how close the main Rothari force is to finding the caravan.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

"Blood and Silk" is designed to be your first step into the world of Fate's Edge. It introduces the core mechanics through a straightforward story of redemption and community while giving players meaningful choices that affect the outcome.

The adventure emphasizes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Character Growth:} From exiles to heroes through player choices
\item \textbf{Resource Management:} Boons, Assets, and XP as meaningful currencies
\item \textbf{Narrative Consequences:} Every action affects the story's direction
\item \textbf{Collaborative Storytelling:} Players and GM work together to create the tale
\end{itemize}

Remember that Fate's Edge is about the story, not just the dice rolls. Encourage players to describe their actions vividly, embrace the complications that arise, and let the world react to their choices in meaningful ways.

Whether the PCs become beloved protectors of Millhaven or tragic figures who couldn't save the day, their story will be one worth telling. The dice will guide you, but it's your choices that write the legend.

\begin{center}
\textbf{What are you willing to risk to reshape the world around you?}
\end{center}

In Millhaven, that question might just have a simple answer: everything.
