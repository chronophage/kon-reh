\section*{Adventure Overview}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}lX@{}}
\textbf{Title:} & The Usurper's Gambit \\
\textbf{Region:} & Ecktoria – Marble, Brass, \& Fire \\
\textbf{Theme:} & Legitimacy, bureaucracy, ritual power, imperial decline \\
\textbf{Level:} & Veteran (Tier III) \\
\textbf{Length:} & 4–5 Sessions \\
\end{tabularx}

\section{Premise}

Ecktoria, heir to the shattered Utaran Empire, stands on the knife-edge of civil conflict. A charismatic pretender has seized the loyalty of the capital militia, silenced dissenting censores, and begun invoking ancient rites to claim the Mandate of Everflame. Meanwhile, the recognized heir — King Aldric the Lame — clings to legitimacy through law, tradition, and the blessing of the High Temple.

The players navigate a city where every marble colonnade hides a conspiracy, every mosaic conveys a political message, and every oath is engraved in red-lacquered tablets guarded by the Censors. They must decide: bolster one claimant, forge a third path, or engineer a peaceful transfer of power in a system designed to resist change violently.

\section{Hook}

Choose or roll (DV 3 Investigation to determine truth):
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Envoy's Humiliation:} Before the Great Baths of Aurix, the Lame King's Envoy is publicly mocked, their ceremonial staff struck from their hand — a grave insult in Ecktoria. The crowd cheers the Pretender's heralds. (Social/Skill challenge, Presence + Command vs DV 4)
\item \textbf{A Dead Man's Seal:} A courier collapses into the players' arms with a sealed tablet bearing the mark of a supposedly-dead claimant. If true, a surviving cousin could upend every faction's plans. (Investigation + Lore vs DV 5)
\item \textbf{A Contract Invalidated:} A lucrative patronage contract is voided by a Senate Decree — half the Senate claims the decree is legal, the other half claims the seals were forged. (Legal investigation, Sway + Lore vs DV 4)
\end{itemize}

\section{GM Notes}

\subsection{Political Complexity}
Emphasize the Byzantine nature of Ecktorian politics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Every action has multiple interpretations and consequences
\item Legal precedents can be interpreted in conflicting ways
\item Public opinion shifts based on ceremonial displays and rhetoric
\item Economic power is as important as military force
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ceremonial Importance}
Make ritual and ceremony central to the adventure:
\begin{itemize}
\item Proper titles and protocols matter for social interactions
\item Ceremonial objects and locations have real power
\item Public performances can shift political momentum
\item Religious rites determine ultimate legitimacy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bureaucratic Atmosphere}
Create a sense of the weight of imperial tradition:
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe marble halls, gold decorations, and ceremonial regalia
\item Emphasize the importance of proper documentation and seals
\item Show the slow but powerful movement of imperial institutions
\item Illustrate the contrast between public grandeur and hidden manipulation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Player Agency}
Provide multiple paths to influence the outcome:
\begin{itemize}
\item Legal approach: Master imperial law and precedent
\item Social approach: Manipulate public opinion and personal relationships
\item Military approach: Use force to support chosen faction
\item Economic approach: Control financial resources and trade
\item Religious approach: Influence spiritual legitimacy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Story Beats}
Use the political environment for complications:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 SB: Minor bureaucratic delay, small legal complication
\item 2 SB: Important document goes missing, key NPC becomes suspicious
\item 3 SB: Public scandal damages faction, military unit defects
\item 4+ SB: Major political upheaval, assassination attempt, ceremonial disaster
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Session-Specific Guidance}

\textbf{Session 1 Focus:} Establish political landscape and hook players into the conflict. Players should understand both claimants have strengths and weaknesses.

\textbf{Session 2 Focus:} Deep dive into legal and archival aspects. Players learn that legitimacy is complex and can be influenced.

\textbf{Session 3 Focus:} Crisis point with Basilica blockade. Players must make strategic choices that affect final outcome.

\textbf{Session 4 Focus:} Climactic resolution and consequences. All previous elements converge in final choices about Ecktoria's future.

\subsection{Alternative Endings}

If players attempt unconventional solutions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Popular Uprising:} Players incite general revolt against both claimants
\item \textbf{Foreign Intervention:} Players invite external power to resolve succession
\item \textbf{Religious Solution:} Players convince High Priest to reject both claimants
\item \textbf{Economic Coup:} Players use financial power to force political resolution
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scaling for Different Tiers}

\textbf{Tier III (Veteran):} Standard complexity with significant political and military resources.

\textbf{Tier IV (Paragon):} Add foreign power complications, multiple simultaneous succession crises, and empire-wide implications.

\textbf{Tier V (Mythic):} Introduce divine intervention, reality-altering political magic, and consequences that reshape the entire region.
