\section{Premise}

A dwarven merchant house has called in a debt owed by one of the player characters, demanding they retrieve a sacred artifact from a dangerous section of the Spine Underway. The artifact, a ceremonial hammer known as the Forgefather's Voice, was pledged as collateral decades ago but was never properly transferred according to dwarven law. Now, with the house facing financial difficulties, they're enforcing the ancient contract, forcing the players into the deep places beneath the mountains where ancient dangers still stir.

\section{Hook}

\begin{itemize}
\item Clan-Speaker Thrain Ironhold arrives with a formal delegation to collect on the debt, presenting ancient contracts and demanding immediate compliance under dwarven law. (DV 4 Social encounter, Presence + Command)
\item The players' patron sends an urgent message warning them that a dwarven house is making claims on their behalf, and they need to resolve the situation before it escalates. (DV 3 Investigation, Wits + Lore)
\item A dwarven prospector approaches them in a tavern, desperately seeking help to recover the same artifact for reasons he won't fully explain. (DV 3 Social, Presence + Sway)

\section{GM Notes}

\subsection{Dwarven Culture}
Emphasize the importance of honor, tradition, and proper procedure in dwarven society. Every interaction should reflect these values:
\begin{itemize}
\item Players respecting customs gain +1 Position
\item Violating protocols worsens Position by 1 step
\item Proper titles and ceremonies matter for social interactions
\item Legal procedures are complex but fair when followed
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Underground Atmosphere}
Create a sense of the vast, ancient dwarven realm:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use sound descriptions: distant forges, dripping water, stone settling
\item Vary architectural details: smooth ancient stonework vs. rough natural caves
\item Describe the weight of stone above, the permanence of underground construction
\item Different areas should feel distinct: halls of state vs. working tunnels vs. ancient passages
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Legal Complexity}
Dwarven law is intricate and ancient:
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple precedents exist for most situations
\item Specific procedures must be followed for validity
\item Contracts can have unexpected interpretations
\item Legal experts (like Clan-Speaker) can find creative solutions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supernatural Elements}
The Deep Stirrings represent patient, ancient supernatural forces:
\begin{itemize}
\item Prefer manipulation to direct confrontation
\item Communicate through dreams, stone-song, and omens
\item Have waited decades for proper resolution
\item Are not inherently evil, but have different priorities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Player Agency}
Provide multiple paths to resolution:
\begin{itemize}
\item Legal approach: Navigate dwarven law system
\item Social approach: Negotiate with all factions
\item Investigation approach: Discover true history and find creative solutions
\item Direct action approach: Force resolution through power
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Story Beats}
Use dwarven environment and customs for complications:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 SB: Minor procedural violation, small legal complication
\item 2 SB: Important NPC becomes suspicious, document goes missing
\item 3 SB: Cave-in blocks path, ancient guardian activates
\item 4+ SB: Major faction turns hostile, supernatural manifestation occurs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Session-Specific Guidance}

\textbf{Session 1 Focus:} Establish dwarven legal/cultural framework. Players should understand the debt is legitimate but complex.

\textbf{Session 2 Focus:} Introduce supernatural elements and underground challenges. Players learn there's more to this than simple contract law.

\textbf{Session 3 Focus:} Deep supernatural contact and moral complexity. Players must balance competing legitimate claims.

\textbf{Session 4 Focus:} Climactic resolution and consequences. All previous elements converge in final choices.

\subsection{Alternative Endings}

If players fail to achieve clean resolution:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Partial Success:} Temporarily satisfy one faction while creating new problems
\item \textbf{Compromise:} Artifact remains in limbo, ongoing tension between factions
\item \textbf{Pyrrhic Victory:} Solve immediate problem but create worse long-term issues
\item \textbf{Escalation:} Situation becomes larger conflict involving multiple dwarven houses
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scaling for Different Tiers}

\textbf{Tier II (Seasoned):} Reduce entity Caps, simplify legal procedures, provide more NPC assistance.

\textbf{Tier III (Veteran):} Add political complications, increase entity power, complicate legal requirements.

\textbf{Tier IV (Paragon):} Introduce kingdom-level political implications, multiple simultaneous conflicts, entity gains patron backing.
