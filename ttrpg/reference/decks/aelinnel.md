Quick use notes
	•	Draw until all four suits appear: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2–5 → 4, 6–10 → 6, J/Q/K → 8, A → 10).
	•	Diamonds are codified outcomes (charms/passes/host-rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
	•	If any A shows, echo moonlight-on-stone motifs—antlers in shadow, petals that cut, a tide that breathes—and let a shortcut appear where no road should be.
