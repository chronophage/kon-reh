Below is a faction-flavored 52-card generator that plugs straight into the SRD’s standard-deck procedure (Spades=Places, Hearts=People/Factions, Clubs=Complications, Diamonds=Rewards; rank sets Clock size). Use exactly as written in the SRD (4-card Full Seed; color = tone; rank = clock).  ￼  ￼  ￼

Kahfagia flavor touchstones here—lantern-law, pilots, moving beacons—come from the Concordance’s Kahfagian notes and the Diwān line about “harbour-law… written with lanterns on water; jurisdiction moves like tide.” Treat them as lore only, not rules.  ￼  ￼

Quick use notes
	•	Highest rank sets the primary Clock (2–5 → 4-seg, 6–10 → 6-seg, J/Q/K → 8-seg, A → 10-seg).  ￼
	•	Treat Diamonds as position-changers and codified outcomes (licenses, charters, rights)—don’t roll them.  ￼
	•	If your draw comes up all red or all black, remember the SRD’s tone and free-CP nudges.  ￼  ￼
