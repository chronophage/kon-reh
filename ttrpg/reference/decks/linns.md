Quick use notes
	•	Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main clock (2–5 → 4, 6–10 → 6, J/Q/K → 8, A → 10).
	•	Diamonds are codified outcomes (rights/tokens/escorts) that shift position rather than call for a roll.
	•	If any A appears, echo sea-omens—horns on wind, white horses on the swell, a verse unfinished until landfall.
