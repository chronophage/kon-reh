Quick use notes
	•	Draw 4 cards to seed: Spade=place, Heart=actor, Club=pressure, Diamond=leverage. Highest rank sets the main clock (2–5→4, 6–10→6, J/Q/K→8, A→10).
	•	Treat Diamonds as codified outcomes (rights/papers/permits) that shift position rather than require tests.
	•	If you want stronger “Acasia-is-cursed” vibes, any A also adds a lingering omen you can echo in later scenes.
