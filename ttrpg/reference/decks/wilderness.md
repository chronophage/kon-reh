Quick use notes
	•	Seed with 4 cards (ensure all four suits): Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main clock (2–5→4, 6–10→6, J/Q/K→8, A→10).
	•	Diamonds are codified outcomes—rights, passes, windows—that change position rather than call for a test.
	•	If an A appears, add a lingering omen of the land (a smell on the wind, a sound that carries too far) you can echo in later scenes.

Fast reskin palette
	•	Forest: swap dunes→deadfall, spindrift→canopy flare, prowlers→boar/wolves; water = spring/stream.
	•	Desert: swap bog→salt pan, fog→dust, shelter = overhang/wadi; water = seep/fog net.
	•	Tundra/Ice: swap dune shift→ice heave, fire→spindrift, boats→sleds; prowlers = bears/wolves.
	•	Coast/Isles: crossings = reef shelves, prowlers = seals/raiders, alarms = harbor booms; fuel = driftwood.
	•	Swamp/Fen: crossings = corduroy/log causeways, bad ground = peat crust, prowlers = gators/leeches.
	•	Highlands: crossings = cols and scree traverses, alarms = beacon chains, prowlers = cats/eagles.
