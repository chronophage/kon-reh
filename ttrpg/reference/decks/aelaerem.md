Aelaerem — “Hearth & Hollow” 52-Card Generator

Spades — Places (lanes, orchards, mills, downs, barrows)
	2.	Willow ford with flat stones and a bowed pollard that remembers faces.
	3.	Cider-press barn; sweet reek, flies, old songs, doors that stick after dusk.
	4.	Chalk sheep-downs with a turf maze cut like a wheel.
	5.	Millpond under alders; the wheel turns some nights without water.
	6.	Bluebell wood path; rabbit-gates and snares set by careful hands.
	7.	Hedge-tunnel lane between fields; nine stiles locals count “eight-and-one.”
	8.	Cup-mark stone on the verge; butter left in niches goes missing kindly.
	9.	Barrow-by-the-beech where bees go quiet at noon.
	10.	Market green with maypole and stocks; carved village stones turned inward.

Q. Mother’s Orchard; rows straighten if you don’t look—curve if you do.
K. Moot Oak with lantern nails hammered deep and benches at the roots.
A. Hollow Field, a ring where no plow will hold a line, not for any coin.

Hearts — People & Factions (keepers, elders, mummers, quiet powers)

	3.	Miller and his watch-geese—better sentries than men.

	9.	Traveling tinker with bright kettles and a dull knife for cutting oaths.
	10.	Bailiff of the Moot Oak, as polite as a noose.
J. Wold-Wardens, elders who swear by hedges, not crowns.
Q. Apple-Matron, hostess of harvest feasts; power sits where she pours.
K. Thresher-King in harvest robes: a title that moves but never leaves.
A. The Pale Shepherd—comes when lambs are born and when people go missing.

Clubs — Complications/Threats (folk omens, rites, beasts, night)
	2.	Unseasonal fog; the road walks you back to your own gate.
	3.	Scarecrow turns; it watches the lane, not the field.
	4.	Soured wassail; the bowl gives back names you did not speak.
	5.	Black sow through the orchard; hooves scuff every charm.
	6.	Hive-swarm at dusk; smoke curls the wrong way.
	7.	Old song taken up by children; adults remember the verse none should sing.

Diamonds — Rewards/Leverage (blessings, tokens, host-rights, exceptions)
	2.	Guest-loaf & salt—one night’s safe board anywhere with a red door.
	3.	Cider-mark—a free cup on the green buys gossip and patience.
	4.	Hedge-pass ribbon—step through any thicket unsnagged, once.
	5.	Bee-queen share—honey and warning from the hives when danger nears.
	6.	Shepherd’s whistle—dogs and door-bolts heed you for one scene.
	7.	Lantern-writ—the lamps stay lit along your path despite wind.
	8.	Mummers’ license—lawful mask and after-dark crossing for a feast day.
	9.	Orchard right—pick at Mother’s Orchard without offense; fruit hides a truth.
	10.	Mill token—the wheel turns at any hour, grain or rumor ground.
J. Apple-Matron’s blessing—hands help unseen when you ask no coin.
Q. Private moot under the Oak; elders hear you alone, precedent sticks.
K. Thresher-King’s guard—six red-hooded harvesters escort you; doors open.
A. Pale Shepherd’s clause—once, the Hollow will not notice you; pass uncounted.

Quick use notes
	•	Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2–5 → 4, 6–10 → 6, J/Q/K → 8, A → 10).
	•	Diamonds are codified outcomes (blessings/tokens/host-rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
	•	If any A appears, echo Hearth & Hollow motifs—quiet bells, red thread, watch-geese, footsteps under the soil—so the dread feels woven through the hedges.
