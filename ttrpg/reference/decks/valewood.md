Quick use notes
	•	Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2–5 → 4, 6–10 → 6, J/Q/K → 8, A → 10).
	•	Diamonds = codified outcomes (keys/rights/passes) that change position rather than call for a roll.
	•	Empire Echo: when a J/Q/K is the highest rank in your seed, add one visible relic-logic (floating stairs, singing locks, patrol-shades).
	•	Aces: any A means the wood actively rearranges paths or wakes structures; echo that change later so the place feels alive.
