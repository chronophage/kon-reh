% --- Patron: Thrysos, Satyr King of Revels (Ecstasy & Excess) ---

\subsubsection{Thrysos, King of Revels (Ecstasy \& Excess)}
\textit{Lore.} Where torches flare and cups spill, where dancers stamp until dawn, there strides Thrysos crowned with ivy and horn. He is both host and beast, a patron of license who laughs at law. In his train follow the masked and the wild, the broken who dance to forget, the bold who revel to remember. His rites intoxicate, inflame, and unmask—yet each cup leaves its mark.

\textbf{Signs.} Wine that never sours; a mask that smiles without wearer; goat-tracks circling thrice before vanishing.

\textbf{Cantor’s Temptation.} His promise is freedom without end: no oaths, no chains, only song and cup and fire. Yet those who drink too deeply wake to find they serve not joy but appetite.

\textbf{Chorus of the Lost.}  
\emph{“Drink, and be unafraid.”}  
\emph{“Every mask is true when worn long enough.”}  
\emph{“In the dance we are all kings—until the dawn.”}
