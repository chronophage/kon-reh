\subsubsection{The Sacred Geometry, Architect of Perfect Forms (Harmony \& Immutable Law)}
\textit{Lore.} The Sacred Geometry teaches that perfect forms underlie all seeming chaos: the divine ratios that steer the spiral of galaxies, the symmetry that lattices frost, the measures that turn sound into song. Not merely a calculus but the hidden architecture of the world, it makes artists of order from those who serve it. Devotees do not count to chill the heart; they weigh and tune until beauty and structure converge, revealing that disorder is often only unrecognized design waiting to be drawn true.

\begin{quote}
``In the drift of atoms, the sweep of planets, and the curve of a lover's smile, the same ratios ring. Learn them, and you may conduct the world's quiet music.''
\end{quote}

\noindent\textbf{Domain Focus}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Perfect Proportion:} building and reading ideal ratios and harmonious relationships
  \item \textbf{Pattern Recognition:} discerning the structures that govern complex phenomena
  \item \textbf{Harmonic Resonance:} working with natural frequencies and number-made consonance
  \item \textbf{Form Architecture:} imposing clear structure on tangled situations
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Harmonic Alignment (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A tool calibrated to pristine ratios (e.g., golden ratio gauge, well-cut compass arc).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Align to natural harmonics. Gain \(+1\) die to actions involving balance, proportion, cadence, or keeping true time.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Perfect Structure (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Consecrated compass and straightedge, inked to tolerance.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Impose right form on a chaotic or damaged structure (scaffold, plan, treaty, formation). Treat one structural obstacle as one step easier; gain \(+1\) die to build/repair/spatial-reason rolls.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Perfection hardens: for the scene the structure gains unnatural resilience, but order draws opposition; mark \textbf{1~SB (Clubs)}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Resonant Field (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A floor or air traced with precise tessellations and nodes.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Establish a harmonic field. Allies gain \(+1\) die to precise, coordinated, or team actions; disruptive acts suffer \(-1\) die.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The field self-sustains and begins to spread beyond intent; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Pattern's Heart (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A solved proof or perfectly symmetrical token.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Perceive the governing pattern of a complex situation (supply chain, intrigue, weather, battle). Gain \(+2\) dice to prediction/strategy/systemic-understanding and ask two questions about how the pattern drives the present.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Clarity cuts: gain the insight, but for this scene suffer \(-1\) die to intuitive or purely emotional responses; mark \textbf{1~SB (Diamonds)}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Immutable Design (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Extended; Zone; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A space gridded for measure and set with true ratios.\\
\textbf{Effect:} For the scene, rewrite local behavior by perfect principle. Choose one: gravity follows geometric progression; time flows by harmonic ratios; space conforms to exact symmetry.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Make the design persist, but elsewhere thins and wobbles: mark \textbf{+2 Obligation} and begin \textbf{Harmonic Dissonance [4]}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} Extended rite; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}. \ \emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Architect's Vision (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Self; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A ledger of forms and their tuned relations.\\
\textbf{Effect:} For one session, treat all rolls of pattern recognition, structural analysis, or harmonic application as one step better (Position or Effect, Keeper's choice).\\
\textbf{Push It:} Sight devours softness: gain the power, but lose ease with imperfection's beauty; mark \textbf{Harm 1 (Stress)}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} Extended rite; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}. \ \emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.

\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{1cm} p{6cm} p{6cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Tier} & \textbf{Benefit} & \textbf{Cost / Quirk} \\
\midrule
1 & \textbf{Harmonic Sense:} \(+1\) die to \textit{Notice} when patterns, ratios, or symmetries matter. & \textbf{Pattern Obsession:} Must measure or set-right pleasing patterns you spot; resisting costs time or \textbf{1~SB (Diamonds)}. \\
\midrule
2 & \textbf{Perfect Precision:} Once/scene, achieve faultless calculation or measure. & \textbf{Social Dissonance:} \(-1\) die to emotive social rolls; harmony feels truer than feeling. \\
\midrule
3 & \textbf{Structural Insight:} \(+2\) dice to architecture/engineering or imposing order on chaos. & \textbf{Order Compulsion:} Must correct deliberate disorder; suffer \textbf{Fatigue 1} when forced to abide it. \\
\midrule
4 & \textbf{Universal Harmony:} Once/session, apply a harmonic rule that makes a chaotic situation predictable. & \textbf{Perfectionist Limitation:} \(-1\) die to improvisation; the ``correct'' solution calls. \\
\midrule
5 & \textbf{Divine Proportion:} Once/session, see perfect ratios in any phenomenon and work with them. & \textbf{Mathematical Focus:} \(-1\) die to acts not readily quantified; the abstract blurs unless counted. \\
\midrule
6+ & \textbf{Architect of Reality:} Once/session, briefly refit local reality by perfect principle. & \textbf{Form Prison:} Mark \textbf{+3 Obligation}; risk failing in rough, noisy worlds, taking \textbf{Harm 1} in chaotic zones. \\

\subsubsection*{Playstyle Notes}
The Sacred Geometry suits makers and marshals who tune chaos into form. Its rites prize clean plans, crisp teamwork, and seeing the load paths hidden in trouble. The cost is rigidity: the more you perfect, the harder rough edges are to bear.
