\subsection{Patron: Xhak'Thul, the Thunder-Speaker}
\label{subsec:xhakthul}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={\textbf{Xhak'Thul --- The Thunder-Speaker}},colback=white,colframe=black!60]

\textbf{Domains:} Storm, Shock, Awe, Primal Memory

\textbf{Sigil:} A spiral that ends in a lightning-bolt; the path from mundane center to explosive, divine edge.

\textbf{Lore.}
Before words, there was thunder. Before scripture, lightning carved its commandments into the bones of the world. Xhak'Thul is the Voice That Splits Mountains, the Drum That Shakes Foundations, born from the first storm that ever raged across primal earth.

Where civilized priests speak in temples, Xhak'Thul speaks in storms.  
His faithful do not study. They \emph{dance}. They \emph{shout}. They \emph{move} with the sky.

\begin{quote}
``Feel the drum in your bones before you hear it in the sky. When the storm speaks, you will already be dancing to its rhythm.'' \\
— Xhak'Thul, through a shaman's broken teeth
\end{quote}

Xhak'Thul does not grant gentle miracles. His gifts are terror, awe, and vitality ripped raw from nature.

\subsection*{Storm-Speaking (Core Rite Logic)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Immediate Magic:} Xhak'Thul’s rites require no long rituals; power flows when the world demands it.
  \item \textbf{Emotional Fuel:} Rites gain potency from fear, anger, or ecstatic frenzy.
  \item \textbf{Environmental Synergy:} Power increases during storms, wildfires, earthquakes, or panic.
  \item \textbf{Body-Memory:} Movement, drumming, pacing, chanting; the body becomes conduit and conductor.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Fear-Eater Path}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Absorb fear from others to empower yourself.
  \item Inspire awe or terror to strengthen your presence.
  \item Turn panic into force.
  \item Become a walking storm.
\end{itemize}

% RIVALRIES & OBLIGATION -----------------------------------

\subsection*{Rivalries}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Penitent Lich (Remembrance \& Restitution):} Xhak’Thul is chaos; the Lich is structured memory.
  \item \textbf{The Traveler (Ways \& Roads):} Paths versus explosions in the sky.
  \item \textbf{Varnek Karn (Necromantic Archives):} Chaos-life versus ordered-death.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Obligation Triggers}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{8+ Segments:} Xhak’Thul demands a spectacle of awe and fear: level a tower, part a river, terrify a city.
  \item \textbf{10+ Segments:} The storm begins speaking through you. Refusal ends access to Rites until a catastrophic display of power is made publicly.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Signs of Favor}
Ozone scent, hair moving from static, voice that carries across crowds, storms reacting to emotion.
