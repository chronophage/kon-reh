\subsection{Patron: Xhak'Thul, the Thunder-Speaker} \label{subsec:xhakthul}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={\textbf{Xhak'Thul --- The Thunder-Speaker}},colback=white,colframe=black!60]

\textbf{Domains:} Storm, Shock, Awe, Primal Memory

\textbf{Sigil:} A spiral that ends in a lightning-bolt; the path from mundane center to explosive, divine edge.

\textbf{Lore.} Before words, there was thunder. Before scripture, lightning carved its commandments into the bones of the world. Xhak'Thul is the Voice That Splits Mountains, the Drum That Shakes Foundations, a power born from the first storm that ever raged across the primal earth. His faithful are whirlwinds of action—they do not study; they dance, they shout, they move with the sky's fury. His gifts are not gentle miracles but raw terror, awe, and vitality ripped from nature's heart.

\begin{quote} ``Feel the drum in your bones before you hear it in the sky. When the storm speaks, you will already be dancing to its rhythm.'' \ — Uttered by a shaman, teeth cracked from the force of the invocation \end{quote}

\subsection*{Storm-Speaking (Core Rite Logic)} \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Immediate Magic:} Rites require no long rituals; power flows when emotion and world demand it. \item \textbf{Emotional Fuel:} Potency increases with channeled fear, anger, or ecstatic frenzy. \item \textbf{Environmental Synergy:} Effects are heightened during storms, wildfires, earthquakes, or mass panic. \item \textbf{Body-Memory:} Movement—drumming, pacing, chanting—is the core component; the body is both conduit and conductor. \end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Fear-Eater Path} Xhak'Thul's followers learn to feed on the chaos they create. \begin{itemize} \item Absorb fear from others to empower your own presence. \item Inspire awe or terror to strengthen your will and physical force. \item Turn panic around you into a weapon or shield. \item Become a walking storm, unsettling the world by your mere presence. \end{itemize}

% CORRUPTION ----------------------------------------------

\subsection*{Shock & Awe Corruption Table}

% CORRUPTION ----------------------------------------------

\subsection*{Corruption}

Those who channel the storm risk being consumed by it. The static builds in the soul before it arcs out into the world.

\begin{longtable}{p{2cm}p{5cm}p{5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Level} & \textbf{Manifestation} & \textbf{Stirrings} \\
\midrule
1--2 & \textbf{Static Cling:} Your touch carries a static shock. Metal objects faintly hum in your presence. & You feel a restless energy before a storm. Minor lies itch like a rash. \\
\midrule
3–4 & \textbf{Storm-Touched:} Your hair stirs without wind. Your voice occasionally cracks like thunder. Small electronics flicker near you. & You become irritable in calm, silent places. You crave loud arguments and violent weather. \\
\midrule
5–6 & \textbf{Lightning Rod:} You are dangerously magnetic. Unshielded metal flies to your hands. Your eyes crackle with faint light. & You feel a compulsion to disrupt order and create chaos. Peace feels like a cage. \\
\midrule
7–8 & \textbf{Walking Storm:} A localized wind stirs around you. You smell of ozone and wet stone. You cannot whisper; your voice is a low rumble. & You lose patience with lengthy plans. You prefer direct, explosive action, regardless of the cost. \\
\midrule
9–10 & \textbf{Heart of the Tempest:} You are the eye of a personal storm. Rain sheats you indoors, lightning threatens those who anger you. & You see the world only as a force to be broken or commanded. Gentler emotions are foreign memories. \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

% RIVALRIES & OBLIGATION -----------------------------------

\subsection*{Rivalries} \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Penitent Lich (Remembrance & Restitution):} Orderly, structured memory versus Xhak’Thul's primal chaos. \item \textbf{The Traveler (Ways & Roads):} Carefully laid paths versus the sky's explosive, pathless nature. \item \textbf{Varnek Karn (Necromantic Archives):} The cold order of death versus the chaotic fury of life expressed through storm. \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Obligation Triggers} \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{8+ Segments:} Xhak’Thul demands a public spectacle of awe and fear, such as leveling a tower, parting a river, or terrifying a city district. \item \textbf{10+ Segments:} The storm begins speaking through you constantly. Refusal to act on its impulses ends your access to Rites until you perform a catastrophic display of power. \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Signs of Favor} The scent of ozone, hair stirring from unseen static, a voice that carries perfectly over crowd noise, local storms that react to your emotional state.
