\subsection{Nidhoggr, the World-Worm (Dreaming Antiquity)}
\textit{Lore.} Beneath stone and sleep coils \textbf{Nidhoggr}, who gnaws at the roots of time. He does not speak quickly; he dreams in centuries. To press your ear to the earth is to risk drowning in the silence of aeons. Yet for those who endure, he whispers truths long buried, memories fossilized in stone, and the slow inevitability of cycles unbroken. His followers walk in twilight between dream and ruin, bearing the weight of all that has been.

\paragraph*{Playstyle Notes}
Nidhoggr rewards patience and contemplation. Followers excel in investigation, prophecy, and situations where historical knowledge provides advantage. The corruption progression leads characters toward becoming living libraries of forgotten lore, but at the cost of connection to the present moment. Ideal for scholars, archaeologists, and characters who understand that some truths are worth waiting centuries to uncover.
