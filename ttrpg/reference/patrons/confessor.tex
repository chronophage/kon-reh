% --- Patron: The Confessor Beneath the Bell (Burden & Exchange) ---

\subsection{The Confessor Beneath the Bell (Burden \& Exchange)}
\textit{Lore.}
The Confessor waits in places where guilt gathers—under church spires, in confessionals long abandoned, in the echo of unspoken sins.
He does not judge, nor absolve. He \emph{takes}. Each confession is a transaction: your burden for his silence, your pain for his weight.
Those who serve him walk with bowed heads, their mouths stitched by invisible threads, ringing faintly when they speak.
To follow the Confessor is to understand that sin does not vanish—it migrates, carried from one soul to another until the bell tolls and the weight becomes unbearable.

\paragraph*{Rites of the Confessor}

\paragraph*{Echo of Sin (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A hollow vessel or the ringing of a bell.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Absorb 1 Story Beat (Hearts or Diamonds) from an ally or NPC within Near range. Convert it into \(+1\) Obligation.
You know the emotional nature of the sin but not its source.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Absorb 2 SB at once; mark \(+1\) Fatigue as your body trembles with resonance.

\paragraph*{Burden Transference (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A red cord or shared drink.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Transfer one Condition, Fatigue, or 1 SB from another target to yourself.
You may attempt to reduce their Harm by 1 level; if successful, mark 1 Fatigue.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Split the burden among two allies; mark 1 SB (Hearts).

\paragraph*{Absolution by Ash (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; Yes (sustain by prayer).}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A pinch of consecrated ash or soot from a burned confession.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Lay hands upon a penitent and whisper a truth they cannot bear.
You draw out their stain, reducing their \textbf{Corruption by 1}.
The sin does not vanish—it transfers to you as \emph{Burdened Heart}:
mark 1 SB (Hearts) or \(+1\) Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Cleanse multiple targets within Close range (such as a battlefield after mass violence);
each additional soul adds \(+1\) Obligation as their sorrows echo within you.

``Confession is not release—it is migration.
Sin leaves one throat only to find another willing to carry it.''
\end{quote}

\paragraph*{Sin-Eater's Pact (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Shared confession whispered into an object or tattooed sigil.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Create a bond between you and the confessor; you may suffer 1 Fatigue to grant \(+2\) dice to their Resolve test or save.
If they fail, you suffer 1 Harm instead of them.\\
\textbf{Push It:} You may take both Harm and Condition; mark 1 SB (Clubs).

\paragraph*{Echoed Voice (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A small handbell or resonant surface.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Once/scene, replay the echo of a confession you have absorbed.
You may compel a target who shares its nature (Guilt, Regret, Betrayal) to act or reveal truth; \(\mathrm{DV}=\) your Presence.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Echo manifests physically; mark \(+1\) Obligation and 1 SB (Diamonds).

\paragraph*{Bearing of the Flame (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A candle lit from a funeral pyre or sanctified brazier.\\
\textbf{Effect:} You kindle the fire of confession into yourself,
transforming stored guilt into luminous heat.
Choose one:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Purge:} Reduce your own \textbf{Corruption by 1} and clear 1 SB (Hearts).
  All within Near range feel the warmth of release; they gain \(+1\) die to their next \textit{Resolve} roll.
  \item \textbf{Transmute:} Instead of purging, ignite a consecrated symbol (bell, candle, blade) to carry the burden.
  The object gains the \texttt{[CONFESSION]} tag until session's end, resonating with guilt when used in service of truth.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Push It:} Purge two points of Corruption, but the flame spreads—the Keeper may introduce a new \textit{Complication Clock (Fire, Revelation, or Repentance)} reflecting what truth your cleansing sets free.

\paragraph*{Bearing the Weight [OATH] (High, 11 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Chains, bells, or weighted relics.\\
\textbf{Effect:} You take upon yourself the burdens of a group (up to Tier + Presence).
Each member removes one Condition, transferring it to you as 1 Fatigue or 1 Harm.
You gain \(+1\) effect when acting to protect them.\\

\paragraph*{Atonement's Toll (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}\\

\textbf{Materials:} A circle of confessionals, chains linking each seat, the tears of seven penitents.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Create a Communal Confession ritual. All present must confess their darkest secret or suffer \(-2\) dice to all rolls. Shared sins create bonds (\(+1\) die to aid each other); conflicting sins create tension (GM may spend SB to escalate conflicts).\\

\textbf{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph*{The Weight of Ages [BANE][FOLLOW-UP] (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Touch; No.}\\
