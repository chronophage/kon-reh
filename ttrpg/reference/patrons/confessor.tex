% --- Patron: The Confessor Beneath the Bell (Burden & Exchange) ---

\subsubsection{The Confessor Beneath the Bell (Burden \& Exchange)}
\textit{Lore.} 
The Confessor waits in places where guilt gathers—under church spires, in confessionals long abandoned, in the echo of unspoken sins.  
He does not judge, nor absolve. He \emph{takes}. Each confession is a transaction: your burden for his silence, your pain for his weight.  
Those who serve him walk with bowed heads, their mouths stitched by invisible threads, ringing faintly when they speak.  
To follow the Confessor is to understand that sin does not vanish—it migrates, carried from one soul to another until the bell tolls and the weight becomes unbearable.

“Speak, and be freed. But understand—what you cast off, I will bear. And what I bear, you will one day inherit.”
