# % --- Patron: Mor'iraath, the Demon of Entropy & Destruction ---

\subsubsection{Mor'iraath, the Demon of Entropy \& Destruction}
\textit{Lore.} Mor'iraath is not merely a lord of flame, but the \textit{principle} of entropic consumption through commerce and conflict. Where Maelstraeus builds webs of interdependence, Mor'iraath seeks to reduce all value to ash. He rules the City of Cinder not through law, but through the inevitability of burnout, the finality of a deal gone wrong, and the allure of power that consumes its wielder. He is the patron of those who would burn the world for profit or pleasure, the ender of cycles, and the devourer of bargains. His sigil is a contract in flames that rewrites itself with each reading.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Burning Ledger (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Instant; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A scrap of parchment singed at the edges.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Target suffers -1 die to one economic/social transaction roll (negotiation, trade, payment) this scene. Gain +1 die to an attack or destructive action this scene.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The effect lingers subtly on the target's dealings for the rest of the session; mark 1 SB (Clubs) as financial records become... difficult.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of Ashen Sight (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Rub ash into the eyes (harmless but stings).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Gain +1 die to Notice/Investigate actions to find weakness, fault lines, or instability in objects, structures, or social groups. Gain +1 Effect when targeting such weaknesses.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Also see the "price" or "cost" associated with a target (in SB, Fatigue, or narrative terms); the sight is disturbing, mark 1 SB (Diamonds) as the knowledge unsettles you.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Conflagration Clause \textnormal{[AREA][FOLLOW-UP]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A small fire set upon a contract or valuable item.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Designate a zone. Enemies in the zone suffer -1 die to actions requiring patience, stability, or cooperation. Once per round, as an action, you may cause a small, damaging explosion (treat as a hazard, Cap 2-3, Harm 1-2) anywhere within the zone.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Increase the explosion's Cap by +1 and Harm by +1; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Infernal Audit \textnormal{[REVEAL][CURSE]} (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A ledger opened to a random page, held aloft.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Target must make a Resolve test (DV 3) or suffer -1 die to all actions due to stress/anxiety. On a failure, you learn one hidden financial/legal obligation or secret debt they are trying to hide. If they are currently benefiting from a deal or boon, it becomes [COMPROMISED] or suffers a minor setback (GM discretion).\\
\textbf{Push It:} The target suffers Harm 1 (Stress) on a failed test; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Final Sale \textnormal{[BANISH][UNWARD]} (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Instant; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A contract signed in the target's blood (or symbolic equivalent) and burned.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Target a visible Outsider or significant magical effect/ward. Test DV = Cap or Tier. On Hit: add +DV segments to its Leash/Exit Tally or immediately suppress/unravel the effect; on Partial: add +1 segment or apply a minor suppression/setback; on Miss: the contract backfires, apply 1 SB (Spades) to the caster.\\
\textbf{Push It:} If successful, the target/entity is not just banished/suppressed but \textit{consumed}, potentially gaining a benefit for the caster (like clearing 1 Obligation or gaining 1 Boon), but mark 2 SB (Diamonds) as the act draws the attention of other, potentially more powerful, entities or creates a lingering void/malignancy.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of the Worldfire Gambit \textnormal{[WARD][OMEN]} (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A massive bonfire fed by significant symbolic items (wealth, oaths, structures).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Consecrate a vast zone (like a city district or battlefield). For the next session: All transactions, oaths, and value-based interactions within are inherently unstable and carry risk. Allies gain +1 Effect to destructive actions but suffer -1 die to cooperative or stabilizing actions. Enemies suffer the opposite. Start a "Consumption Clock" [8] (representing the area's value/energy being burned away).\\
\textbf{Push It:} The effect is permanent (until countered) and the Consumption Clock ticks faster (+1/2 automatically per scene); mark +2 Obligation.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.

\toprule
\textbf{Tier} & \textbf{Benefit} & \textbf{Cost / Quirk} \\
\midrule
1 & Entropic Sight: +1 die to Notice weaknesses in structures, plans, or social constructs. & Destructive Impulse: Must make a Resolve test (DV 3) to resist sabotaging flawed systems when encountered. \\
\midrule
2 & Ashen Resilience: Once per scene, treat a failed destructive action as a success, but mark 1 SB (Spades). & Pyromania: Suffer 1 Fatigue when deprived of fire or destructive acts for extended periods. \\
\midrule
3 & Consumption's Hunger: Gain +1 die to rolls involving burning, destroying, or consuming resources for power. & Wasteful Nature: Cannot resist using more resources than necessary; suffer -1 die to conservation or efficiency rolls. \\
\midrule
4 & Infernal Bargain: Once per session, make an offer so tempting that the target must make a Resolve test (DV 4) or accept it. & Corrupting Influence: Allies within Near range suffer -1 die to rolls involving patience or long-term planning. \\
\midrule
5 & Worldfire's Gaze: Once per session, declare that all value-based interactions in a scene are subject to entropic forces. Trades may fail, oaths may weaken, and power may consume its wielder. & Entropy's Touch: Mark +1 Obligation whenever you benefit from others' failures or losses. \\
