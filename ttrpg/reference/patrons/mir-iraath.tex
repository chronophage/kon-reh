\subsubsection{Mor'iraath, the Destroyer}
\textit{Lore.} Mor'iraath is the principle of absolute annihilation—the void that leaves no trace, no memory, no possibility of return. Where others corrupt or decay, Mor'iraath eliminates. His followers become agents of finality, wielding the power to unmake what others merely damage. He delights not in the process of destruction, but in the perfect moment of ceasing-to-be. To serve him is to embrace the beauty of endings and the power that comes from making things never have been.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Perfect Ending (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Instant; Touch; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} The final component of something (last brick, final word, closing signature).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Cause one small thing to cease existing entirely—no remains, no trace, no possibility of reconstruction. Gain +1 die to rolls involving finality or absolute conclusions.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Ending creates a beneficial void—gain 1 Boon as space opens for something else; mark 1 SB (Spades) as reality adjusts to the absence.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Unmaking Gaze (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A lens of obsidian or void-glass.\\
\textbf{Effect:} +2 dice to identify the precise weakness that will cause complete collapse. See the ``breaking point'' in any structure, plan, or construct. Next destructive action against the identified target gains +1 Effect.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Gaze becomes prophetic—see three possible endings for one target; choose which occurs but mark 1 SB (Diamonds) as fate resists your vision.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Cleansing Flame \textnormal{[AREA][VOID]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Fuel that was once part of what you intend to destroy.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Create a fire that burns not just substance but essence—what is consumed by this flame never existed. Zone becomes [VOID]—things that enter may cease to exist. Enemies suffer -2 dice to preservation/continuation actions.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Flame becomes selective—choose what is unmade and what remains; mark +1 Obligation as you assume judgment over existence itself.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Absolute Negation \textnormal{[BANISH][CURSE]} (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Instant; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} The complete destruction of something that represents the target (lock for door, name for person, fragment for whole).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Target suffers -2 dice to resist any effect that would cause their non-existence. If reduced to Harm 0 by your actions, they are [BANISH]ed from all realities—they never were, never could be.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Negation becomes retroactive—target never existed in your presence; mark 2 SB (Hearts) as timeline rewrites around their absence.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Unraveling \textnormal{[WARD][CONSUME]} (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} The foundational element of what you wish to unmake (keystone, cornerstone, source code).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Touch causes cascading dissolution—target and all things fundamentally connected to it begin immediate unmaking. Test DV = Complexity. Success: target and connections cease to exist. Partial: significant damage, accelerated decay. Miss: backlash, mark 2 SB.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Unraveling becomes contagious—similar things in Near range also begin unmaking; mark +2 Obligation.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of the Final Void \textnormal{[TRANSFORM][VOID]} (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Complete dedication of the space to Mor'iraath's principle of non-existence.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Zone becomes a pocket of absolute negation. Anything that enters ceases to exist after 1d4 rounds unless they make Spirit + Resolve test (DV 5) each round. Space itself becomes [VOID]—cannot be entered without risk of unmaking.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Void becomes permanent and expands at 1 segment per scene; mark Harm 2 and +3 Obligation as you become partially unmade yourself.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.

\midrule
2 & Perfect Strike: Once per scene, your destructive action gains +2 dice and ignores all resistance to ending/ceasing. & Destruction Proximity: Suffer 1 Fatigue when near things of personal value; their existence pains you. \\
\midrule
3 & Unmaking Touch: Gain +2 dice to rolls involving absolute destruction—no remains, no possibility of return. & Entropy Aura: Objects of value near you show signs of decay/premature aging; allies suffer -1 die to rolls involving cherished possessions. \\
\midrule
4 & Final Judgment: Once per session, declare one thing in Near range must make Spirit + Resolve test (DV 4) or cease to exist entirely. & Existential Hunger: Suffer -1 die to rolls involving creation, preservation, or continuation; you hunger to end what others would sustain. \\
