\section{Patron Entry: Mor'iraath, the Demon of Fire and Destruction}

\patronbox{Lore:} Mor'iraath is not merely a lord of flame, but the \textit{principle} of entropic consumption through commerce and conflict. Where Maelstraeus builds webs of interdependence, Mor'iraath seeks to reduce all value to ash. He rules the City of Cinder not through law, but through the inevitability of burnout, the finality of a deal gone wrong, and the allure of power that consumes its wielder. He is the patron of those who would burn the world for profit or pleasure, the ender of cycles, and the devourer of bargains. His sigil is a contract in flames that rewrites itself with each reading.

\patronbox{Patron's Gift (Imbuement):} Once per scene as an action (cost: 1 Boon; requires Thiasos), touch an item to imbue it until scene end with +1 Melee and +1 Skirmish or Command (when leveraging intimidation/destruction) (Thematic). Push It: extend for one extra scene by marking +1 Obligation. (Same rules as core Invoker Gift).

        \item \textbf{Materials:} A contract signed in the target's blood (or symbolic equivalent) and burned.

        \item \textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +2 Obligation.
        \item \textbf{Push It:} If successful, the target/entity is not just banished/suppressed but \textit{consumed}, potentially gaining a benefit for the caster (like clearing 1 Obligation or gaining 1 Boon), but mark 2 SB (Diamonds) as the act draws the attention of other, potentially more powerful, entities or creates a lingering void/malignancy.
    \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Effect:} Consecrate a vast zone (like a city district or battlefield). For the next session: All transactions, oaths, and value-based interactions within are inherently unstable and carry risk. Allies gain +1 Effect to destructive actions but suffer -1 die to cooperative or stabilizing actions. Enemies suffer the opposite. Start a ``Consumption Clock'' [8] (representing the area's value/energy being burned away).
        \item \textbf{Invoke:} Extended ritual; mark +3 Obligation.
        \item \textbf{Push It:} The effect is permanent (until countered) and the Consumption Clock ticks faster (+1/2 automatically per scene); mark +2 Obligation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\patronbox{Obligation:} Starts at 6 for Tier III characters, scaling appropriately for higher tiers.

\patronbox{Rivalry:} Maelstraeus (Obvious Antagonism - deals vs. destruction), Livaea (Subtle Manipulation - desire can feed or be consumed by fire).

\patronbox{Hard Obligation Triggers (Module-Specific):}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Obligation 8+ Segments:} A \textbf{Silent Collector} arrives to enforce an ``emergency clause'' in your pact -- demands an immediate, costly service or marks you as a debtor in default (\textbf{GM chooses: +2 Harm, lose asset, or mark permanent Condition}).
    \item \textbf{Obligation 10+ Segments:} \textbf{Maelstraeus calls in his debt immediately} -- you must perform a significant service for him \textit{right now}, potentially derailing your current objective or forcing a choice between patrons. Failure risks permanent enmity.
\end{itemize}
