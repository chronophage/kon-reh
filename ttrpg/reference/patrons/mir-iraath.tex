\subsubsection{Mor’iraath, the Demon of Cinders (Entropy \& Ruin)}
\textit{Lore.} Mor’iraath is the devourer of value, the ruin written in every contract, the flame in every bargain’s shadow. Where Maelstraeus counts debts, Mor’iraath cashes them in. He rules not by decree but by inevitability: all things burn, all bargains rot, all structures collapse.  

His realm, the City of Cinders, is built from the ashes of treaties, treasuries, and temples. His followers are predators of worth—saboteurs, arsonists, profiteers of collapse. They do not destroy blindly; they destroy to consume, to feast, to prove that nothing lasts. His sigil is a burning contract that rewrites itself each time it is read, always ending with the same clause: \textit{“All must be paid in ash.”}
