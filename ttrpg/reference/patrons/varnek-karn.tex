\subsubsection{Varnek Karn, the Death's Arbitrator}
\textit{Lore.} Varnek Karn is the Eternal Mediator, the Death-Bound Broker who negotiates the final transactions between the living and the dead. He does not merely track debts—he facilitates the commerce of mortality. In his vast bone-halls, spirits and necromancers come to negotiate, trade obligations, and settle the cosmic accounts that bind the worlds of life and death. Those who serve him become deal-makers in the economy of eternity, able to broker agreements that span the veil.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Death-Bound Contract (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Bone fragment from both parties (or proxy) and ink made from grave-mist.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Create a binding agreement between living and dead. Both parties gain +1 die when fulfilling terms. Create 4-segment \emph{Contract Active} clock (can be spent to enforce terms). You gain +1 die as mediator.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Contract becomes magically enforced—breach inflicts Harm 1 automatically; mark 1 SB (Hearts).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Spectral Broker \textnormal{[BIND]} (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Scales from a recently deceased merchant or judge.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Gain +2 dice to negotiate between conflicting parties (living/dead, necromancers/spirits). Can propose ``Varnek's Terms''—balanced solutions both sides find acceptable. Successful mediation grants 1 Boon.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Mediation becomes binding on all parties; refusal to accept terms creates 1 SB (Diamonds) as cosmic balance demands payment.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Debt Exchange \textnormal{[OATH]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Two personal items representing the debts being traded.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Facilitate the transfer of one obligation from one party to another. Both parties must agree; you act as neutral arbiter. Successful exchange: each party gains +1 die toward their new obligation, -1 die from old one.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Exchange becomes magically binding; breach by either party reflects back on you (mark 2 segments on \emph{Mediator's Burden} clock [6]).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Court of the Undead \textnormal{[COMMAND][WARD]} (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Circle of judges' bones and scales of justice.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Convene Varnek's Court—neutral ground for disputes between living/dead. Zone becomes [WARD]ed—no hostile magic/deception. All parties gain +1 die to honest negotiation, suffer -1 die to lies/deception.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Court's judgment becomes magically enforced; all must comply or suffer Harm 2; mark 2 SB (Hearts).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\textbf{Materials:} Pages from Varnek's own ledgers, written in bone-ink.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Reveal all karmic debts, obligations, and unfinished business in the zone. All present must make Spirit + Resolve test (DV 4) or be compelled to speak their true debts. You gain +2 dice to mediate any revealed conflicts.\\
\textbf{Push It:} All debts in zone become immediately actionable; mark 3 SB (Spades/Clubs) as cosmic accounting demands immediate settlement.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of the Final Arbiter \textnormal{[CLEANSE][CURSE]} (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Touch; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Heart stone from a judge, blood of someone willing to pay any price.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Serve as ultimate arbiter in any dispute involving life/death. Your judgment is cosmically binding—cannot be appealed, evaded, or ignored. Successful arbitration settles all related debts permanently.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Judgment becomes absolute law—reality reshapes to enforce it; mark Harm 2 and +2 Obligation as cosmic forces recognize your authority.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.
