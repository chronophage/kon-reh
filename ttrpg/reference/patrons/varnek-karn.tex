\subsubsection{Varnek Karn, the Death's Negotiator (Bargains with the Departed)}
\textit{Lore.} Varnek Karn dwells in the grey between life and death, where the newly departed linger with unfinished business and elder shades guard secrets dearer than gold. He is the broker who speaks across the veil, the mediator of disputes between living and dead, and the archivist of every promise sworn beyond the grave. His servants practice post-mortem diplomacy: they negotiate, consult, and contract with spirits as equals—mindful that the dead are patient and rarely generous.

\begin{quote}
``The dead have all the time in the world to consider their offers, and no need to rush to agreement. They know what the living forgot, and remember every slight with perfect clarity. In Varnek's halls, both parties pay a price—but the currency is never what you expect.''

\subsubsection*{Playstyle Notes}
Varnek Karn favors investigators, arbiters, and heralds of funerary law. Power grows through cultural sensitivity, shrewd bargaining, and careful record-keeping; the price is a thinning tie to warmth and mortal ease. Expect mysteries of lineage, obligations that outlive their makers, and parleys where both sides of the veil demand their due.

\noindent\textbf{Varnek Karn emphasizes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Diplomacy over Dominion:} bargaining with the dead rather than commanding them
  \item \textbf{Knowledge Brokerage:} trading for secrets and testimonies beyond the grave
  \item \textbf{Cultural Protocols:} rites, tokens, and proper doors for speaking with ancestors
  \item \textbf{Mediation:} resolving conflicts that bind the living to the dead
  \item \textbf{Historical Continuity:} showing how past vows shape the present
\end{itemize}
