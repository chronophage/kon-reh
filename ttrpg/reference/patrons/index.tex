\section{Of Patrons, Runes, and Invokers}
\label{sec:invoker-lore}

\begin{quote}
``You wish to walk the road of power? Then listen well. The world is old, and older still are the voices beneath it. We call them \textit{Patrons}, though they were never sworn to us. They are the tides that move unseen, the keepers of forgotten bargains, the sleepers beneath the stone and the stars. To call upon them is to dip a hand into a river that has carved mountains.''
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{The Patrons}
\index{Patrons}

Patrons are vast intelligences---not gods, though some worship them as such. They are embodiments of \textit{concepts} and \textit{forces} rather than sovereigns. Raéyn, mistress of the tides and the sea-routes. Khemesh, the crushing inevitability of the deep. Nidhoggr, the worm that dreams in the roots of time. Each offers power, but always with cost: fatigue, scars upon fate, or a slow unweaving of one’s own story.

To entreat a Patron is to risk being marked. Their Rites are gifts and snares both.

\paragraph{No True Acolyte}
Interpreting a patron's will is often a dangerous prospect in and of itself. Many a Runkeeper has found themselves on the opposite end of machinations from others from the same patron.

\begin{quote}
``Every Rune is a promise. Every line a covenant. Do not mistake the Runekeeper’s silence for weakness; their memory is the foundation of our craft.''
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{The Invokers}
\index{Invokers}

\textbf{Invokers} are those who dare. Neither archivists nor worshippers, they are travelers on the knife-edge between story and ruin. An Invoker learns the Rites of a Patron, weaves them into their own Art, and bends fate for a moment. Yet invocation is not command: it is negotiation. The Patron always leaves its mark. The stronger the Rite, the deeper the scar.

Invokers are often wanderers, exiles, or seekers. To common folk they are feared---witches, oathbreakers, meddlers with things not meant for mortal hands. But when the village falls to plague, when the sea closes its roads, when the dead refuse their rest, it is an Invoker who is called upon.

\subsubsection{Closing Words}
The dance between Patron, Runekeeper, and Invoker is a triangle of peril and necessity. Without Patrons, there is no power. Without Runekeepers, no record. Without Invokers, no action. Together, they shape the crooked, perilous art we call Invocation.

\end{table}

Note: Some talents, Rites, or magical paths may specify alternative corruption costs or additional consequences for Push It actions. When explicitly stated, those specific rules override the universal costs.

\paragraph{Clearing Corruption}
Corruption may be reduced through \textit{purging rituals}, such as exorcisms, sacred songs, or rites of contrition. 
These require a test (typically \textbf{Lore + Spirit}) against a DV equal to the character’s current corruption level.  
On success, reduce corruption by 1. On failure, the corruption manifests violently, imposing a temporary Condition or advancing its narrative expression.  

Optional: A \textbf{Story Beat} may also be spent to attempt such a ritual, representing the personal cost of atonement. Patrons may demand specific acts of service, sacrifice, or obligation as part of the purging process.

\paragraph{Quick Rulings.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Position Nudge:} In a home locus, start one step better; in a rival locus, one step worse.
  \item \textbf{Effect Shade:} Where a Patron dominates, consider an Effect bump; where opposed, consider Limited Effect unless paid for.
  \item \textbf{Symbol Interference (Invokers):} Carrying both sides’ Symbols increases narrative noise: first ritual each scene may mark +1 Obligation (Keeper’s call).
  \item \textbf{SB Color:} When spending SB in these matchups, prefer suits that fit: Hearts (social), Spades (harm/escalation), Clubs (material cost), Diamonds (numinous disturbance).

When \textbf{Obligation} is ticked past its maximum (from Rites, vows, bargains), mark \textbf{Fatigue} based on scene severity:

  \item \textbf{High}: +3 Fatigue

% Extended Section: Clearing Obligation Segments

\section{Clearing Obligation Segments (Extended)}\label{sec:obligation-clearing-extended}
\index{Obligation}\index{Patrons}\index{Acts of Service}\index{Boon}\index{Focused Devotion}

Obligation measures the growing narrative weight of a Patron’s attention. It is not debt in a transactional sense, but rather the sense that a Patron has invested, noticed, and expects relevance. This section expands the SRD guidance with philosophy, examples, and optional rules.

\subsection{Core Principle}\label{subsec:obligation-principle}
Obligation is cleared through \textbf{meaningful engagement} with the Patron. The system assumes Patrons are narrative entities: they do not care about coin, but about resonance. Clearing requires a demonstration that the character is still walking their path.

\subsection{Off-Screen Clearing (Primary Method)}\label{subsec:obligation-offscreen}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Act of Service.} Clear 1 segment by performing a resonant service aligned to the Patron’s themes or goals.\index{Acts of Service}
\item \textbf{Requirement.} The player must provide an \emph{Intricate Description} of the act—detail, symbolism, and impact.
\item \textbf{Scope.} The act need not be arduous, but it must be thematically precise (e.g., weaving a shadow tapestry for Ikasha; negotiating a shrewd pact for Maelstraeus).
\item \textbf{Reward.} Successful clearing often comes with narrative color: whispers of approval, subtle omens, or a temporary advantage in Patron-facing scenes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{On-Screen Clearing (Optional Mechanic)}\label{subsec:obligation-onscreen}
\paragraph{Talent: Focused Devotion (3–5 XP).}\index{Focused Devotion} Once per scene, spend 1 Boon to clear 1 segment of Obligation from a Patron. This cannot remove segments accrued during the same scene. It represents a desperate or ritualized gesture to stave off attention without fully satisfying it.

\subsection{Narrative Implications}\label{subsec:obligation-implications}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Player Agency.} The player defines how service manifests, reinforcing creativity within the Patron’s thematic frame.
\item \textbf{GM Collaboration.} The GM adjudicates sufficiency: Is the service aligned? Is it intricate enough?\index{GM Guidance}
\item \textbf{Ongoing Relationship.} Clearing segments emphasizes that the Patron bond is active, not static. The relationship evolves with acts of recognition.
\item \textbf{Scene Economy.} The cap on on-screen clearing ensures the mechanic cannot erase costs just accrued. It forces the long view.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Worked Examples}\label{subsec:obligation-examples}
\paragraph{Example 1: Ikasha, Angel of Serpents.} A character clears a segment by shedding their old cloak, burning it, and narrating how it symbolizes leaving behind a former self. The GM rules it sufficient, noting the subtle scent of scales in the air.

\paragraph{Example 2: Maelstraeus, Infernal Bargainer.} The player narrates writing an elaborate contract that offers a small service to a minor devil. The GM agrees: the service is thematically aligned and clears 1 segment. Later, this contract may resurface as a hook.

\paragraph{Example 3: Isoka, Angel of Change.} The group weaves discarded materials into a shrine mosaic. Its intricate description convinces the GM, who clears 1 segment and hints that a future boon will resonate with this act.

\subsection{Optional Modules}\label{subsec:obligation-modules}
\paragraph{Overflow Consequences.} When Obligation fills and overflows, the Patron demands immediate service. This may be delivered as a Complication Point (or Story Beat) trigger: the Patron intrudes, offering aid with a binding cost.\index{Overflow}
\paragraph{Segment Scaling.} Particularly devoted characters may require greater services: clear 2 segments with a dramatic act (pilgrimage, sacrifice, or political maneuver), subject to GM approval.
\paragraph{Shared Obligation.} In multi-character bonds, the GM may allow a group act of service to clear multiple segments, but only if each player contributes to the Intricate Description.

\subsection{GM Guidance}\label{subsec:obligation-gm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Be Generous with Hooks.} Reward creativity with flavorful omens, not just a cleared box.
\item \textbf{Maintain Tension.} Do not allow trivial or repetitive services to count. Require new symbolic angles each time.
\item \textbf{Keep On-Screen Costly.} Remind players that Focused Devotion costs a Boon and cannot erase fresh debt.
\item \textbf{Tie to Patron Themes.} If a service drifts off-theme, let it fail or only partially clear.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Summary},colback=gray!5,colframe=black]
Obligation is cleared through \textbf{thematic service, intricate description, and narrative engagement}. Off-screen acts remain the primary path; on-screen clearing is a costly safety valve. Treat every act as a chance to show how characters evolve under their Patron’s gaze.\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{GM Notes}\label{subsec:acts-service-gm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Novelty Over Volume.} Repeating the same petty act does not keep clearing segments; vary the symbol or site.
\item \textbf{Precision Beats Difficulty.} A sharp thematic hit at ``petty'' scale can clear 1 segment as surely as a muddled ``modest.''
\item \textbf{Hook the World.} Many of these acts conveniently create future clocks, NPC ties, or bargains---use them.

\item \textbf{Patron’s Largess} A Patron’s will is mysterious, but their displeasure is rarely subtle. For narrative reasons, the GM may rule that a Patron is especially offended—perhaps by a neglected omen, a rival gaining favor, or simple caprice—and exact an additional toll beyond the usual cost.

\section{Patron Influence on Fear}
\label{sec:patron-fear-influence}

\subsection{Core Mechanic}
\label{subsec:patron-fear-core}

Certain Patrons amplify Fear when their domains overlap with the \emph{Magic Tags} of the Fear Table (see \S\ref{subsec:fear-table}).  
When a Fear effect is rolled, if the Patron's sphere matches one of the listed tags, apply one of the following options:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Amplify:} Increase the severity of the effect (e.g., ``Flee'' becomes reckless flight, ``Freeze'' becomes catatonia).
  \item \textbf{Reroll:} The GM may reroll the result once, choosing the more narratively appropriate option.
  \item \textbf{Resonance:} Add an additional condition, such as Fatigue, Complication Point, or a mark on the character's Fear Track.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Guidelines}
\label{subsec:patron-fear-guidelines}

\subsubsection{Tag Matching}
When a Fear effect is triggered, compare the effect's Magic Tags against the active Patron's Domain Tags. If any tags match, the Patron's influence applies.

\subsubsection{Multiple Patrons}
If multiple Patrons are present with overlapping domains, the GM may:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Choose the most thematically appropriate influence
  \item Apply influences sequentially (reroll then amplify)
  \item Allow players to choose which influence affects them
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Player Agency}
Players should be informed when Patron influence is active and given the opportunity to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Spend resources (Boons, Willpower) to resist the influence
  \item Narrate how their character resists or embraces the effect
  \item Choose from available influence options when multiple apply
\end{itemize}
