% --- Patron: The Silent Choir (Mercy & Silence) ---

\subsubsection{The Silent Choir (Mercy \& Silence)}
\textit{Lore.} The Silent Choir is not a single god, but a resonance of countless throats that closed upon confession. It is mercy made manifest through omission, the hush that follows unbearable truth. Each time a mortal spares another by silence, a new note is added to its endless hymn. The Choir’s worshippers are confessors, undertakers, and peacekeepers—those who learn that kindness sometimes demands concealment.  

Where the Witness proclaims, the Choir endures. Its silence is not absence, but a promise: that even guilt can rest if left unspoken.

### Rites of the Silent Choir

\paragraph*{Hollow Blessing (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; Yes (maintain by stillness).}  
\textbf{Materials:} A bell without clapper, or a throat marked with ash.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Render a willing ally unheard for three beats; they cannot be targeted by sound-based actions or social influence.  
\textbf{Push It:} Silence extends to all within Close range—foes and allies alike; mark 1 SB (Spades).

---

\paragraph*{Mercy’s Veil (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} White cloth folded thrice and burned to smoke.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Erase a target’s memory of one recent event (within the past day). The gap feels peaceful, not empty.  
\textbf{Push It:} Affect multiple targets within Near; mark 1 Obligation as their forgotten grief finds you instead.

---

\paragraph*{Litany of the Unheard (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Instant; Zone; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A written prayer destroyed before it is read.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Suppress all noise in a Zone for one scene; ranged and verbal coordination suffer –2 dice.  
\textbf{Push It:} Seal the silence into an object (weapon, room, seal); mark 1 SB (Clubs) as words flee from it permanently.

---

\paragraph*{The Ninth Voice (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A shard of glass wrapped in white thread.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Strike one confession or secret from shared reality; all who knew it feel an inexplicable calm.  
\textbf{Push It:} Remove a deeper truth (history, oath, or memory) at cost of 2 Obligation; reality shivers as the Choir hums approval.

---

\paragraph*{Hymn of the Still Tongues [OATH] (High, 11 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} Circle of salt traced in silence.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Bind all present to withhold a single truth. Breaking the vow forces 2 SB (Hearts) and inflicts the “Mute” Condition until atonement.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Expand to include unwilling participants; mark +2 Obligation as their screams are absorbed into the hymn.

---

\paragraph*{The Peace of Forgetting (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; No.}  
\textbf{Materials:} A page torn from a personal journal, consumed by flame.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Remove one tormenting memory or lingering spiritual Condition. The subject feels mercy—but loses a fragment of self.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Erase the memory from all witnesses; mark +3 Obligation as you carry their burden in silence.
