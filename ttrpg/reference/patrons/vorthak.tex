% --- Patron: Vorthak, the Consuming Void ---

\subsubsection{Vorthak, the Consuming Void}
\textit{Lore.} Vorthak is the Hunger that Hungers for Itself—the void that devours not just what exists, but the very potential for existence. He is the appetite that grows stronger with each feeding, yet remains eternally unsatisfied. His followers become conduits for this cosmic hunger, able to channel it to consume not just physical matter, but the conceptual frameworks that give reality meaning. But beware: feed Vorthak's hunger and he will eventually turn his appetite upon you.

\begin{quote}
Feed the hunger, or let it feed you. The choice ends when the hunger begins.
\end{quote}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Appetite's Edge (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self/Touch; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A hunger that has already been felt (empty stomach, unfulfilled desire, missing memory).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Channel Vorthak's hunger to enhance consumption—next act of taking/gaining something is +2 dice. If consuming resources: gain 1 additional unit. If taking knowledge: ask 1 extra question. Create 4-segment \emph{Hunger Fueled} clock.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Hunger becomes contagious—nearby willing targets also gain +1 die to their next consumption; mark 1 SB (Clubs) as the hunger spreads.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Conceptual Feast (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} The framework of something that could exist but doesn't (blueprints, plans, potential).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Devour potential itself—prevent one planned/expected event from occurring. Gain +1 die to rolls involving denial, refusal, or prevention. Affected parties suffer -1 die when trying to manifest that potential.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Feast becomes gluttonous—devour multiple potentials but mark Fatigue 1 as satiating hunger proves impossible.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Hunger's Vessel \textnormal{[VOID][BIND]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Container that has held something precious/valued.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Create a vessel that can store hunger itself. When triggered, releases stored hunger to consume one specific thing (object, effect, memory). Vessel can hold 3 charges. Each charge: target makes test (DV 3) or suffer appropriate consumption effect.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Vessel becomes intelligent—chooses what to consume but may not align with your desires; mark 1 SB (Spades).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Feast of Understanding \textnormal{[CURSE][REVEAL]} (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} The complete consumption of something complex (entire library, intricate mechanism, detailed plan).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Gain perfect understanding of consumed subject—+3 dice to related knowledge rolls this session. But you also inherit its hunger—you must consume something of equal complexity within the arc or suffer Harm 1.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Understanding becomes overwhelming—gain insight into the hunger that drives the consumed thing; mark 1 SB (Hearts) as you glimpse Vorthak's true nature.\\

\textbf{Effect:} Zone becomes [WARD]ed against satisfaction—no fulfillment, completion, or satiation possible within. All consumption attempts must exceed normal requirements by 50\% or fail. You gain +2 dice to all consumption/negation rolls in zone.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Ward becomes a feeding ground—anything consumed in zone feeds you directly; mark +2 Obligation as Vorthak's attention intensifies.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of the Self-Consumption \textnormal{[TRANSFORM][CURSE]} (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Self; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Complete dedication of your own essence to Vorthak's hunger.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Offer yourself as the ultimate feast—gain tremendous power (+3 dice to all actions) for one scene, but create a permanent hunger within yourself. After use, you suffer -1 die to all rolls involving satisfaction, completion, or fulfillment.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Hunger becomes your constant companion—gain the ability to consume your own limitations but mark Harm 2 and +2 Obligation as you become partially consumed by the act.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.
