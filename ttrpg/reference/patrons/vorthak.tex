\subsubsection{Vorthak, the Hunger Unbound (Consumption \& Metamorphic Hunger)}
\textit{Lore.} Vorthak is the principle of absolute consumption: an appetite that devours not only what is, but the very potential of what might be. Each feeding transforms both eater and eaten. His servants become conduits of metamorphosis through ingestion, learning to consume not only matter but also properties, identities, and even strands of fate. Power comes by taking in --- and the cost is becoming more like the hunger you channel.

\begin{quote}
``To consume is to become. To devour is to transform. In Vorthak's embrace, the boundary between eater and eaten dissolves into something new --- and something hungry.''

\subsubsection*{Playstyle Notes}
Vorthak favors those who hunt for change through taking in what the world offers: relish clever uses of absorbed traits, judge the \emph{price} of every bite, and beware the slow surrender of the self. Expect scenes of metamorphosis, bargaining for what can be eaten, and hard choices where power tastes like you.

\noindent\textbf{Vorthak emphasizes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Transformation through Consumption:} becoming what you devour
  \item \textbf{Metamorphic Power:} fundamental, identity-shaping change
  \item \textbf{Essence Absorption:} discerning and using a thing's core nature
  \item \textbf{Identity Metabolism:} integrating (or failing to integrate) stolen aspects
  \item \textbf{Hunger Propagation:} letting appetite reshape people and places
\end{itemize}
