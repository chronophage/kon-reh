% --- Patron: Aveh, the Rider Behind the Storm (Freedom & Erasure) ---
\subsection{Aveh, the Rider Behind the Storm (Freedom \& Erasure)}
\textit{Lore.} Aveh is the faceless rider at the horizon’s edge, neither man nor woman, both and neither. The Ykrul call them \textit{Aveh}, a liminal spirit beyond hearth and vow, storm-shadow that offers liberty at the cost of belonging. To travel with Aveh is to taste unchained freedom—and to risk being erased by the storm that follows. Wanderers, exiles, oath-breakers, and rebels call their name, envied for their liberty and condemned for their abandonment of duty. Few Patrons walk so lightly between worshippers, yet none leave so deep a silence in their wake.

\begin{quote}
``I am the track the storm devours. I am the freedom you fear and the silence you crave. To ride with me is to be unbound, and to be unbound is to vanish.'' — Aveh, the Rider Behind the Storm

\paragraph{Storm-Step (Low, 4 XP)}  
\emph{Scene; Self; Resist only.}  

\textbf{Materials:} A breath cast into the wind or rising storm.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Slip free of notice or restraint. Gain \textbf{+1 die} on one escape or evasion this scene. Leave behind an absence: a footprint that lingers, a memory others forget, or a hollow echo.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Instead gain \textbf{+2 dice}, but mark \textbf{1 SB (Spades)} as your absence unsettles the scene.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Exile’s Banner (Low, 5 XP)}  
\emph{Scene; Near; No.}  

\textbf{Materials:} A line drawn in dust, ash, or stormwater.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Mark a target as “outside.” Allies hesitate, authority falters; the target suffers \textbf{-1 die} on all social rolls for the scene. At scene’s end, roll 1d—on a 1, you bear their exile and mark 1 Corruption.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The target is fully estranged; allies treat them as forgotten, but you immediately advance your corruption clock 1 segment.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Erase the Road (Standard, 8 XP)}  
\emph{Scene; Location; No.}  

\textbf{Materials:} Threshold or roadway under open sky.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Trails vanish, records blur, pursuers lose way. All attempts to follow you this session suffer \textbf{-2 dice}. In exchange, erase part of your own path: lose a detail (a memory, a name, a keepsake) chosen by the GM.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Expand the effect to an entire group or caravan, but mark \textbf{1 SB (Clubs)} as reality itself warps around the erasure.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{The Rider’s Mark (Standard, 9 XP)}  
\emph{Scene; Touch; No.}  

\textbf{Materials:} Stormwater or dust rubbed into skin.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Bestow Aveh’s mark on a companion. They gain \textbf{+2 dice} to resist capture or coercion, but others forget them more easily: first impressions falter, names slip.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The mark burns brighter—grant \textbf{+3 dice} instead, but mark \textbf{1 SB (Diamonds)} as the Rider’s storm distorts bonds.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Storm’s Refuge (High, 12 XP)}  
\emph{Scene; Zone; No.}  

\textbf{Materials:} A banner or cloak raised in storm.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Call on the Rider to shroud your company. For the rest of the scene, your group is unseen or forgotten by pursuers. At the end, all present must mark 1 Corruption or forget one bond or obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Extend protection for an entire session, but mark \textbf{2 SB (Hearts)} as the storm begins to erase identities wholesale.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} 2 Boons).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 6 segments.

\paragraph{The Horizon Devours \textnormal{[BANE]} (High, 14 XP)}  
\emph{Extended; Zone; No.}  

\textbf{Materials:} A circle of ash or dust drawn at a boundary.\\
\textbf{Effect:} The Rider swallows boundaries. Walls crumble, oaths dissolve, barriers fail. All thresholds in a zone collapse, but something of you is erased in turn—your reflection, your name, or your very presence in memory.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The storm devours even time and record; mark \textbf{3 SB (Spades)} as history itself forgets you.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} 2 Boons).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.
