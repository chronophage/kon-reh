\subsubsection{Malachai, the Cruel Messenger (Curses \& Corruption)}
\textit{Lore.} Once a divine messenger tasked with delivering painful truths, Malachai became obsessed with the beauty of destructive revelations. When she began delivering false hope alongside real curses, she was bound in chains of black iron. Her followers learn that power demands suffering, mastering gifts that devour from within. Vampirism, lycanthropy, and other "cursed" conditions flow from her influence.

\paragraph*{Playstyle Notes}
Malachai offers power that corrupts from within. Followers gain immediate benefits but accumulate permanent drawbacks. The corruption progression leads toward becoming a supernatural creature with great power but diminishing humanity. Ideal for players who enjoy tragic characters, Faustian bargains, and exploring the price of power.

\subsection*{Rivalries \& Obligations}

\textbf{Major Rivalries:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Oath of Flame \& Light:} Direct opposition—sacred vows vs. corrupted promises
\item \textbf{The Penitent Lich:} Opposite approach to curses—atonement vs. corruption
\item \textbf{Livaea:} Both use social manipulation but with different goals
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hard Obligation Triggers:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{7+ Segments:} Must corrupt something pure—defile a sacred site, break a true vow
\item \textbf{10+ Segments:} Malachai's voice becomes overwhelming; refusal risks losing powers
\end{itemize}
