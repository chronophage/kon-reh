\subsubsection{Malachai, the Cruel Messenger (Curses & Corruption)} \textit{Lore.} Once a devoted messenger of divine will, Malachai was tasked with delivering the hardest truths—words of warning, prophecies of doom, and revelations that would shatter faith. She became obsessed with the terrible beauty of truth that destroys, the message that heals by wounding. When she began delivering false hope alongside real curses, she was torn from heaven and bound in chains of black iron beneath a forgotten chapel. There, she learned that the cruelest message is the one that sounds like salvation. Her followers master the art of gifts that devour from within, learning that power always demands a price paid in suffering.

\begin{quote} ``I was meant to speak truth. Instead, I learned to whisper lies that taste like honey. What I touch, I corrupt—not with malice, but with the terrible weight of beautiful deception.'' — Malachai, the Cruel Messenger \end{quote}

\paragraph{The Honeyed Wound (Low, 4 XP)}
\emph{Scene; Self or Near; Resist only.}

\textbf{Materials:} A drop of blood mixed with sweet wine.
\textbf{Effect:} Target gains +2 dice to their next roll this scene. If the roll is successful, it also counts as a Triumph (choose an additional positive outcome).
\textbf{[TAGS]:} CURSE, BANE
\textbf{Corruption:} The target immediately takes 1 Corruption, which cannot be resisted. If they already have Corruption, they must mark a new Scar or Obligation instead.
\textbf{Push It:} Instead grant +3 dice and allow the roll to automatically count as a Triumph — but inflict 2 Corruption instead of 1.

\paragraph{Blessing of Chains (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self/Ally; Yes (curse only).} \textbf{Materials:} A broken chain link or iron shackle.\ \textbf{Effect:} Grant supernatural strength/resistance at the cost of growing dependency. Target gains \textbf{+1 die} to one physical action but suffers \textbf{Fatigue 1} if they don't perform a related act of violence or dominance before scene end.\ \textbf{[TAGS]:} BANE, COMMAND\ \textbf{Push It:} The blessing intensifies—\textbf{+2 dice} but \textbf{Fatigue 2}; mark \textbf{1 SB (Spades)} as the curse's hunger grows.\ \emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the False Dawn (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.} \textbf{Materials:} A shard of meteoric iron blessed by false sunlight.\ \textbf{Effect:} Bestow a gift that carries a hidden curse. Target gains one significant advantage (GM choice) but also accrues a 4-segment ``Corruption'' clock. When it fills, they suffer a related curse.\ \textbf{[TAGS]:} CURSE, ILLUSION\ \textbf{Push It:} The gift is more powerful but the corruption clock advances \textbf{2 segments}; mark \textbf{1 SB (Diamonds)} as divine attention notices the perversion.\ \emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Mark of the Cruel Truth (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; No.} \textbf{Materials:} Holy water mixed with graveyard dust.\ \textbf{Effect:} Infect target with a supernatural condition. Choose: vampiric hunger (gain power at night, suffer in sunlight), bestial rage (strength when angry, lose control), or shadow-bind (move unseen, fear light). Condition lasts scene.\ \textbf{[TAGS]:} CURSE, TRANSFORM\ \textbf{Push It:} The condition becomes permanent but grants \textbf{+1 die} to relevant actions; mark \textbf{1 SB (Hearts)} as the curse begins to define their identity.\ \emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{The Messenger's Burden (Standard, 9 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.} \textbf{Materials:} Wear manacles while speaking her true name.\ \textbf{Effect:} Malachai's power flows through you directly. Gain \textbf{+2 dice} to one action per beat for the scene, but each use marks \textbf{1 SB (suit by GM)} as her influence spreads. You cannot refuse her whispered commands.\ \textbf{[TAGS]:} BANE, COMMAND\ \textbf{Push It:} Channel her full fury—\textbf{+3 dice} but mark \textbf{2 SB} and suffer \textbf{Fatigue 1}; her voice grows louder in your mind.\ \emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Curse of Beautiful Lies \textnormal{[BANE]} (High, 12 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.} \textbf{Materials:} Chain links forged from a fallen angel's tears.\ \textbf{Effect:} Transform a target into something more and less than human. They gain a powerful supernatural trait (flying, shapechanging, deathless) but also inherit a fatal weakness (silver vulnerability, need for blood, etc.).\ \textbf{[TAGS]:} CURSE, TRANSFORM, BANE\ \textbf{Push It:} The transformation is complete and irreversible; mark \textbf{2 SB (Hearts)} as they become a permanent monster in the world.\ \emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\ \emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{The Corrupted Gospel (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Zone; No.} \textbf{Materials:} A chapel bell cracked by divine lightning.\ \textbf{Effect:} Corrupt a sacred space, turning it into a font of cursed power. For the next session, all supernatural effects gain \textbf{+1 Effect} but also generate \textbf{+1 SB} when they fail. Blessings become curses, curses become blessings.\ \textbf{[TAGS]:} CURSE, AREA, WARD\ \textbf{Push It:} The corruption spreads to adjacent areas; mark \textbf{3 SB (Diamonds)} as reality itself begins to fray around the perversion.\ \emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\ \emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.

\subsection*{Rivalries}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Penitent Lich (Remembrance \& Restitution):} Direct opposition—she delivers messages of beautiful lies; he demands acknowledgment of painful truths.
\item \textbf{Maelstraeus (Infernal Bargainer):} Tension—both corrupt through temptation, but Maelstraeus offers contracts while Malachai whispers false hope.
\item \textbf{Livaea (Temptation, Desire):} Subtle conflict—both specialize in beautiful corruption, but Livaea tempts with desire while Malachai tempts with false salvation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hard Obligation Triggers}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Obligation 8+ Segments:} Malachai demands you corrupt something pure as proof of devotion—destroy an innocent's faith, taint a sacred object, or spread a beautiful lie that will cause suffering.
\item \textbf{Obligation 10+ Segments:} Her voice becomes impossible to ignore—she begins making your decisions for you, compelling you toward increasingly destructive "gifts." Refusal means losing access to her rites until you prove your loyalty through a major corruption.
\end{itemize}
