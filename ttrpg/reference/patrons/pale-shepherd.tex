\subsubsection{The Pale Shepherd, Guide of Transitions (Passage \& Melancholic Wisdom)}
\textit{Lore.} The Pale Shepherd walks the seam between all things --- life and death, joy and sorrow, memory and forgetting, the known and the unmarked. Neither wholly kind nor cruel, the Shepherd guides those who must pass through the hardest doors. Cloaked, with shadow-sheep that bear the shed wool of old possibilities, the Shepherd offers safe conduct through liminal space for a price paid in memory, feeling, or fate. Those who walk this road learn the hidden routes between states of being and can lead others through their hardest crossings --- but each passage leaves them more attuned to endings than beginnings.

``The Shepherd goes where feet fail, speaks where voices thin, and points where paths run dim. Each journey loosens the knot that tied you to the life you left behind.''

\noindent\textbf{Domain Focus}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Liminal Navigation:} walking and reading thresholds, dusk-roads, and in-betweens
  \item \textbf{Passage Guidance:} steadying hands through grief, change, and transformation
  \item \textbf{Melancholic Wisdom:} understanding born of farewells and last looks
  \item \textbf{Memory Shepherding:} gathering, carrying, and setting down weighted moments
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Gentle Guidance (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A small stone from grave or threshold, warmed in the palm.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Ease a hard crossing. One target gains \(+1\) die to rolls involving change, decision, or emotional steadiness this scene.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Hidden Path (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A thread from a worn garment and a pinch of dawn mist kept in silence.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Find or make a way where none is seen. Gain \(+2\) dice to \textit{Navigation} or \textit{Investigation} when seeking unconventional routes.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The way runs through a true between-place; gain the route but mark \textbf{1~SB (Spades)} as boundary powers take notice.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Shadow Passage (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Black wool and a personal token of the one to be guided.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Open a brief passage through shadow-realms or boundary halls. Target bypasses one insurmountable obstacle or reaches a place normally shut.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The passage leaves a scent-trail; mark \textbf{1~SB (Clubs)} as something may follow.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Memory Flock (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Ash of burned letters and wool shaped into little sheep.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Call shadow-sheep that carry fragments of weighty moments. Retrieve lost details, soothe grief, or glean counsel from what was.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The memories ride too close to the skin --- participants relive them as their own; mark \textbf{1~SB (Hearts)}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Threshold Bond (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Extended; Touch; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Two keepsakes: one of what is left, one of what is sought.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Bind two states, places, or conditions with a felt thread. Those bound can sense across the threshold and lend one another strength during change.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The bond sets like iron; permanent and inescapable. Mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} Extended rite; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}. \ \emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Final Shepherd (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Zone; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Last words, a much-crossed threshold, and the consent of those who remain.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Take the mantle of perfect guide for a great passage --- death, molt, or life-bend. All present gain \(+2\) dice to navigate the crossing; you shoulder the weight of it.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Guidance is flawless but costly: mark \textbf{Harm 2 (Weariness)} and \textbf{+2 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} Extended rite; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}. \ \emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.
