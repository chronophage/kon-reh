# % --- Patron: The Pale Shepherd (Thresholds & Guidance) ---

\subsubsection{The Pale Shepherd (Thresholds \& Guidance)}
\textit{Lore.} The Pale Shepherd is the guardian of thresholds, the watcher at the crossroads between life and death, sleep and waking, the mortal world and the Ways Between. Neither wholly benevolent nor malevolent, the Shepherd tends to the lost, the dying, and those who have wandered too far from their destined path. They appear as a figure in pale, weathered robes, often accompanied by a flock of shadow-sheep whose wool holds fragments of forgotten dreams and lost memories.

The Shepherd speaks rarely, and when they do, their words are riddles that seem to answer questions not yet asked. They are invoked by those who seek guidance through liminal spaces, protection for the dying, or the recovery of lost things—though the Shepherd's help often comes with the price of a memory or a piece of one's future. Their sigil is a white ram's skull wreathed in mist.

Those who serve the Pale Shepherd learn to navigate the spaces between states, to find paths where none seem to exist, and to shepherd others through their own dark nights. However, prolonged service renders the faithful melancholic, as they become attuned to the sorrow and loss that permeate all transitions.
