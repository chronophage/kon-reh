% --- Patron: Grimmir, the Old Man of the Forest (Primal Instinct & Wild Memory) ---

\subsubsection{Grimmir, the Old Man of the Forest (Primal Instinct \& Wild Memory)}
\textit{Lore.} Grimmir is not worshipped so much as remembered—the antlered shadow at the fire's edge, the whisper in wolf-song, the hand that first showed humankind flint and flame. He is the wild within memory, neither wholly man nor wholly beast, the primeval pact that civilization dare not wholly forget. Those who call upon him gain keen senses, primal endurance, and the feral cunning of predator and prey alike—but risk leaving behind the tongue of men for the howl of beasts.

``They say he taught the wolves to stalk, and the children of men to kindle fire. Listen close, and you may remember what your blood already knows.''

The patron rewards engagement with natural environments and offers potent survival and combat abilities. The corruption progression leads toward becoming more beast than human, gaining power at the cost of civilization's comforts.
