\subsubsection{Grimmir, the Wild Speaker (Primal Wisdom \& Seasonal Cycles)}
\textit{Lore.} Grimmir walks the threshold between cultivated lands and untamed wilderness, embodying the ancient pact between humanity and the natural world. Neither wholly beast nor entirely human, Grimmir speaks in root and stone, seasons and sap. Those who walk his path gain insight into nature's patterns, the tongues of leaf and fang, and mastery over the primal forces that shape the wild places—yet must choose which voice to trust: the cultivated mind or the feral heart.

\begin{quote}
``In the space between planted row and forest edge, where the first grain met the first acorn, Grimmir waits. He speaks in the rustle of leaves, the migration of birds, and the patient growth of ancient oaks. Listen, and learn that true power comes not from dominion, but from harmony.''
\end{quote}
