# % --- Patron: Lunara, The Silver Quiet (Reflection & Hidden Truths) ---

\subsubsection{Lunara, The Silver Quiet (Reflection \& Hidden Truths)}
\textit{Lore.} Lunara is the Patron of the moon's quiet ministries: the way light softens an edge, the way a reflection hints at what stands just outside sight, the way a tide carries word from one shore to another. She dwells in the hush between phases, where intent steadies and a careful eye notices what daytime bustle overlooks.

Among lantern-keepers, harbor-watch, and night scholars, she is honored as the \emph{Silver Quiet}—a patient guide who rewards those who look twice and speak once. Her favor attends careful inference, respectful curiosity, and the discipline to hold what is learned until the right moment.

In silver light, the world admits its seams. Follow them gently, and they will open.

\textbf{Effect:} Gain +1 die to perceive inconsistencies, masked intent, or crafted illusions.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Crescent Aside (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Instant; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A slip of silvered thread and a whispered note.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Share a concise insight with one target. They gain +1 die to a closely related action this scene, then test Wits+Resolve (DV~3) or feel compelled to pass the insight onward before scene end. Create a 2-segment \emph{Whispered Truth} token.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The insight travels farther and grows sharper; mark 1~SB (Hearts) as it takes on a life of its own.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Veiled Way \textnormal{[VEIL]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A fine drift of silver dust traced in a spiral.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Establish a zone where hidden joins and quiet approaches reveal themselves. Allies gain +2 dice to investigate, move unseen, or locate concealed access; enemies suffer -1 die to concealment. The area is lightly [VEIL]ed against casual notice.

\textbf{Push It:} One significant cache or path becomes unmistakable; mark 1~SB (Diamonds) as attention gathers.\\

\textbf{Materials:} A key of meteoric silver, tempered under a dark moon.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Open a passage where there should be none: between rooms, districts, or adjacent states of being. Remove one [WARD] that blocks traversal, creating a stable gateway for the scene. Create a 10-segment \emph{Open Gateway} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The door opens precisely where needed—and something else may approach along the same seam. Mark 2~SB (Spades/Clubs).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of Lunar Ascendant \textnormal{[TRANSFORM][WARD]} (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Self; No.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item +2 dice to one attribute for the session,
  \item Immunity to one named subtle influence (fear, beguilement, or a like effect),
  \item Perceive and touch one class of unseen presence,
  \item +2 Effect on careful, mystical, or investigative actions.
\end{itemize}
Begin a 6-segment \emph{Lunar Power} clock and a 4-segment \emph{Sacrificial Cost} clock that starts ticking immediately. You are lightly [WARD]ed against crude disruption.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Make it enduring; mark Harm~2 and start a \emph{Moonbound} [8] clock that colors future lunar workings.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.
