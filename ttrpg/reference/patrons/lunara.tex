\section{Lunara — The Silver Quiet}
\label{patron:lunara}

\subsection*{Lore}
\index{Patrons!Lunara}%
Lunara is the Patron of the moon’s quiet ministries: the way light softens an edge, the way a reflection hints at what stands just outside sight, the way a tide carries word from one shore to another. She dwells in the hush between phases, where intent steadies and a careful eye notices what daytime bustle overlooks. 

Among lantern-keepers, harbor-watch, and night scholars, she is honored as the \emph{Silver Quiet}—a patient guide who rewards those who look twice and speak once. Her favor attends careful inference, respectful curiosity, and the discipline to hold what is learned until the right moment.

\subsection*{Patron's Gift: Lunar Insight}
Once per scene as an action (cost: 1 Boon; requires Thiasos), touch an item or person to imbue it until scene end. The target gains +1 die and +1 Effect when used for close observation, inference, or discerning what is concealed but present.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Extend for one additional scene by marking +1 Obligation. Attentive onlookers sense a hush fall over the work.

\subsection*{Low Rites}

\paragraph{Rite of Night's Reflection (Low)}%
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Self. Materials: A polished surface touched by moonlight.}\\
Gain +1 die to perceive inconsistencies, masked intent, or crafted illusions. Once this scene, ask one yes/no about a hidden aspect of the current situation; the Keeper answers truthfully. Create a 4-segment \emph{Lunar Clarity} clock to spend for an automatic success on a single perception test.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Glimpse one subtle truth others miss; mark \emph{Exposure} +1 as consequences ripple.

\paragraph{Rite of the Crescent Aside (Low)}%
\emph{Duration: Instant; Range: Near. Materials: A slip of silvered thread and a whispered note.}\\
Share a concise insight with one target. They gain +1 die to a closely related action this scene, then test Wits+Resolve (DV~3) or feel compelled to pass the insight onward before scene end. Create a 2-segment \emph{Whispered Truth} token.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The insight travels farther and grows sharper; mark 1~SB (Hearts) as it takes on a life of its own.

\subsection*{Standard Rites}

\paragraph{Rite of the Veiled Way [VEIL] (Standard)}%
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Zone. Materials: A fine drift of silver dust traced in a spiral.}\\
Establish a zone where hidden joins and quiet approaches reveal themselves. Allies gain +2 dice to investigate, move unseen, or locate concealed access; enemies suffer --1 die to concealment. The area is lightly [VEIL]ed against casual notice. Create a 6-segment \emph{Revealed Secrets} clock.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} One significant cache or path becomes unmistakable; mark 1~SB (Diamonds) as attention gathers.

\paragraph{Rite of Quiet Conjunction [REVEAL] (Standard)}%
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Self. Materials: A ring of steady lights (wax or wick).}\\
Enter composed focus. Gain +2 dice to draw connections, consult hard-to-voice lore, or parley with subtle presences. Ask two questions on hidden relations; answers are truthful yet oblique. Create an 8-segment \emph{Quiet Connection} clock.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Touch upon knowledge better left resting; mark \emph{Exposure} +2 as powers take notice.

\subsection*{High Rites}

\paragraph{Rite of the Silver Key [PASSAGE][UNWARD] (High)}%
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Zone. Materials: A key of meteoric silver, tempered under a dark moon.}\\
Open a passage where there should be none: between rooms, districts, or adjacent states of being. Remove one [WARD] that blocks traversal, creating a stable gateway for the scene. Create a 10-segment \emph{Open Gateway} clock.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; +2 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The door opens precisely where needed—and something else may approach along the same seam. Mark 2~SB (Spades/Clubs).

\paragraph{Rite of Lunar Ascendant [TRANSFORM][WARD] (High)}%
\emph{Duration: Extended; Range: Self. Materials: A significant keepsake surrendered under moonlight.}\\
Undertake a measured elevation. Choose three:
\begin{itemize}
  \item +2 dice to one attribute for the session,
  \item Immunity to one named subtle influence (fear, beguilement, or a like effect),
  \item Perceive and touch one class of unseen presence,
  \item +2 Effect on careful, mystical, or investigative actions.
\end{itemize}
Begin a 6-segment \emph{Lunar Power} clock and a 4-segment \emph{Sacrificial Cost} clock that starts ticking immediately. You are lightly [WARD]ed against crude disruption.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} Extended; +3 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Make it enduring; mark Harm~2 and start a \emph{Moonbound} [8] clock that colors future lunar workings.

\subsection*{Obligation Progression}
Starts at 7 for Tier II characters, scaling upward.

\paragraph{Obligation 10+} Seek what guarded hands would prefer unexamined, or share a quietly kept truth with care and consequence. Refusal: divinations and hidden-thing aptitudes falter for one session (--2 dice) and 1~SB is generated when secrets matter.

\paragraph{Obligation 12+} You stand partly \emph{between}. Permanent Condition: \emph{Between the Veils} (--2 dice to firmly mundane tasks) until you complete a quest to anchor yourself.

\subsection*{Persistent Condition: Moon-Touched Sight}
+2 dice to discerning, unmasking, and careful inference; --1 die to plainspoken trust or blunt dealings. Narrative: your gaze finds seams; others guard their words around you.

\subsection*{Rivalries}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Inquisitor Prime:} Antagonism—purge and closure vs.\ patient illumination.
  \item \textbf{The Witness:} Tension—blinding revelation vs.\ gentle unveiling.
  \item \textbf{Varnek Karn:} Counterpoint—records of the ended vs.\ threads still moving.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Circles of the Silver Quiet}
Devotions gather in observatories, tide-chapels, and night schools:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Silver Circle}—practitioners of reflective method and omen-reading.
  \item \emph{Lantern Hands}—field agents who carry news and keep confidences.
  \item \emph{Crescent Wardens}—custodians of waymarks, stairs, and sealed overlooks.
  \item \emph{Star-Readers}—chartists who bind sky-cycles to civic rhythms.
\end{itemize}
Rites favor silver, still water, steady flame, and timing by phase; journals of quiet findings are common among the devoted.

\subsection*{Playtest Scenario: The Dim Crescent}
A faction has learned to tug at a \emph{dark seam} in the sky, trading memory for borrowed ease. Wardens wish to close it cleanly; magistrates want arrests; merchants smell advantage.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Night’s Reflection} to read the seam’s footprint and pierce fair fronts.
  \item \emph{Veiled Way} to uncover side-doors, lofts, and waterstairs used by the faction.
  \item \emph{Quiet Conjunction} to question subtle presences without rousing alarms.
  \item \emph{Silver Key} to route a safe bypass—or to hinge the seam shut from within.
  \item \emph{Crescent Aside} to steady wavering members toward testimony.
  \item \emph{Lunar Ascendant} to match the seam’s pull during the closing pass.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Resolutions include: neat closure (risking what is trapped behind it), gentle containment with watch, negotiated tapering of the practice, or a costly offering that retires the seam entirely. Each route weighs curiosity against care—the Silver Quiet prefers doors handled, not slammed.
