% --- Patron: The Inquisitor Prime (Purity \& Persecution) ---

\subsubsection{The Inquisitor Prime (Purity \& Persecution)}
\textit{Lore.} The Inquisitor Prime is not a saint nor a savior but a mask of history’s witch-hunters, inquisitors, and persecutors, coalesced into a concept. A figure of white ash and iron, faceless but for shifting symbols that echo the fears and faiths of those who look upon it. To follow the Inquisitor is to dedicate yourself to the surgical excision of the arcane: no half-measures, no mercy. Magic is always a liability. The witch must burn.  

Unlike Mykkiel’s marching zeal, the Inquisitor is cold and unrelenting, wielding discipline like a scalpel. Followers train to sniff out spellcraft, to break illusions, to carve wards into earth and flesh. They are not roused by passion, but by certainty that corruption spreads unless cut away. What they gain in clarity, they lose in compassion—each tier drawing them deeper into suspicion until only the pure and the damned remain.  

The sigil of the Inquisitor Prime is a white flame without heat, consuming only the supernatural and leaving only sterile ash behind.
