# % --- Patron: The Inquisitor Prime (Purity & Persecution) ---

\subsubsection{The Inquisitor Prime (Purity \& Persecution)}
\textit{Lore.} The Inquisitor Prime is the embodiment of righteous persecution and methodical destruction of the arcane. Neither god nor demon, but a conceptual force born from centuries of witch-hunting. They appear as a figure in pristine white armor stained with the ash of burned spellbooks, their face hidden behind a helm that shifts symbols depending on the viewer's faith.

The Inquisitor values precision over brutality, knowledge over zealotry. Followers are methodical hunters who understand their prey. They gain protection from magical influence, clarity to pierce illusions, and weapons that cut through supernatural defenses. Prolonged service, however, strips away nuance, leaving only intolerance for ambiguity.

Their sigil is a white flame that burns without fuel --- the pure destruction of corruption.
