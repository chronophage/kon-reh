\subsubsection{Ikasha, She Who Sleeps (Latent Potential \& Shadow)}
\textit{Lore.} Ikasha is the hush between footfalls, the patience of dark water, the black-feathered watcher at every threshold. In stillness she gathers what might be, in crossroads she whispers of what may yet come. Ravens circle her, bearing secrets between worlds.

Blow out the candle. If the room listens back, ask softly. At the next crossroads, the raven waits.
