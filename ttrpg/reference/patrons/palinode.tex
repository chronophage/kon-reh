\subsubsection{Palinode, Queen of Encores (Performance \& Rapture)}
\textit{Lore.} Once a road-cantor who swore to reconcile feuding towns with processions and song, Palinode died between feasts with a chorus unfinished. The refrain refused to end: it braided toasts, hymns, work-chants, and tavern rounds into a living current that still coils through markets and moots. Where a crowd leans forward and a maker holds breath, she arrives. Her signs: a cup that never quite empties, a candle that will not gutter if the chorus holds, a flawless bar that keeps the hand from sleeping.

\paragraph*{Hymn Against Dread (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; Resist only.}
\textbf{Materials:} A lit taper or bell.\\

\textbf{Push It:} Allies who benefit also clear 1 Fatigue or 1 Complication Point, but you gain 1 Fatigue at the end of the scene.\\
