\section{Palinode --- ``Queen of Encores''}
\label{chap:palinode}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Palinode is the rapture that blurs practice and performance---the promise of ``one more verse'' that binds a hall together and steals the night. She crowns craft with applause and turns feasts into vows. Her blessing is brilliance; her cost is that endings come late, or not at all.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{Lore}
Once a road-cantor who swore to reconcile feuding towns with processions and song, Palinode died between feasts with a chorus unfinished. The refrain refused to end: it braided toasts, hymns, work-chants, and tavern rounds into a living current that still coils through markets and moots. Where a crowd leans forward and a maker holds breath, she arrives. Her signs: a cup that never quite empties, a candle that will not gutter if the chorus holds, a flawless bar that keeps the hand from sleeping.

\paragraph*{Devotees}
Choristers, makers, impresarios, and revelers who learn that discipline and abandon open the same door---and that either can trap you inside.

\section*{Patron's Gift (Imbuement)}
\label{sec:palinode-gift}
\textbf{Breath of the Thiasos}: Once per scene as an action (cost: 1 Boon; requires Thiasos), touch an instrument, canvas, script, or stage. Until scene end it gains \textbf{+1 die} and \textbf{+1 Effect} for creative expression or social performance. \emph{Push It:} extend through the next scene by marking \textbf{+1 Obligation}. The work becomes haunting; onlookers are mesmerized, the creator fixates on its flaws.

\section*{Low Rites}
\label{sec:palinode-low}

\paragraph{\textbf{Rite of the Single True Note (Low)}} 
\textbf{Duration:} Instant \quad \textbf{Range:} Self \quad \textbf{Materials:} A note held to hoarseness \\
\textbf{Effect:} For one scene you cannot produce an imperfect sound: singing, playing, and voiced performance gain \textbf{+2 dice}. Suffer \textbf{--1 die} to all non-performance rolls from intrusive perfection. \\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}. \quad \textbf{Push It:} Extend to one ally's performance; both mark \textbf{Exposure +1}.

\paragraph{\textbf{Rite of the Cup that Circles (Low)}} 
\textbf{Duration:} Scene \quad \textbf{Range:} Zone \quad \textbf{Materials:} A communal cup and a round all know \\
\textbf{Effect:} Create a revelry zone: participants gain \textbf{+1 die} to social rolls; \textbf{Fatigue} recovers at twice the normal rate. Time loosens. \\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}. \quad \textbf{Push It:} Leaving requires \textbf{Resolve (DV 3)} or one more hour within; mark \textbf{1 SB (Hearts)} as the party grows a will.

\section*{Standard Rites}
\label{sec:palinode-standard}

\paragraph{\textbf{Rite of the Hands that Won't Let Go \,[BIND] (Standard)}} 
\textbf{Duration:} Scene \quad \textbf{Range:} Self \quad \textbf{Materials:} Your hair woven into a tool of your craft \\
\textbf{Effect:} Enter ruthless focus: all creative rolls \textbf{+2 dice}; ignore the first \textbf{2 Fatigue} from exertion. You become \textbf{[BIND]} to the current piece---you cannot willingly abandon it until completion or ruin. \\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}. \quad \textbf{Push It:} One ally is also bound to assist. Both mark \textbf{1 SB (Diamonds)} as the work eclipses other ties.

\paragraph{\textbf{Rite of the Hooked Chorus \,[COMMAND] (Standard)}} 
\textbf{Duration:} Scene \quad \textbf{Range:} Near \quad \textbf{Materials:} A melody braided from the listener's secret want \\
\textbf{Effect:} \textbf{Presence + Command vs. Resolve (DV 3)}. Success: target is compelled to approach and participate. Partial: they resist but take \textbf{--1 die} to social rolls this scene. Failure: they are entranced and follow for the scene. \\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}. \quad \textbf{Push It:} Affects all in \textbf{Near}; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation} and start \textbf{Compelled Audience [6]} that spawns ongoing social complications.

\section*{High Rites}
\label{sec:palinode-high}

\paragraph{\textbf{Rite of the Consecrated Stage \,[WARD][FOLLOW-UP] (High)}} 
\textbf{Duration:} Extended \quad \textbf{Range:} Zone \quad \textbf{Materials:} A stage kissed with the blood of those who swore to sing there \\
\textbf{Effect:} Hallow a venue. All performances gain \textbf{+2 dice} and \textbf{+1 Effect}. The space is \textbf{[WARD]}ed: anyone who disrupts generates \textbf{2 SB} you may spend immediately. The ward must be fed by continuous performance or it fails catastrophically. \\
\textbf{Invoke:} Extended ritual; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}. \quad \textbf{Push It:} The stage sustains itself but eats life; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation} and start \textbf{Performance Hunger [8]} affecting all performers.

\paragraph{\textbf{Rite of the Crownpiece \,[TRANSFORM][CURSE] (High)}} 
\textbf{Duration:} Extended \quad \textbf{Range:} Touch \quad \textbf{Materials:} Your greatest work and your greatest regret, destroyed together \\
\textbf{Effect:} Birth a transcendent masterpiece: you gain \textbf{+2 dice} to all creative rolls for one session and immunity to social manipulation. The work is \textbf{[CURSE]}d: those who drink it too deeply lose their own spark; you cannot make lesser things. \\
\textbf{Invoke:} Extended ritual; mark \textbf{+3 Obligation}. \quad \textbf{Push It:} The piece wakes and demands. Mark \textbf{Harm 1 (Stress)} and start \textbf{Demanding Creation [6]} that triggers crises when ignored.

\section*{Obligation Progression}
\label{sec:palinode-obligation}
Starts at \textbf{6} for Tier II characters (scale with tier).

\textbf{Obligation 9+}---\emph{The Choosing:} Pick a road. Either consign an unfinished great work to fuel an unending revel, \emph{or} renounce revelry and destroy your instruments to chase one perfect masterpiece. Refuse: all creative rolls \textbf{--2 dice} and generate \textbf{1 SB} when attempting anything less than sublime.

\textbf{Obligation 11+}---\emph{Half in the Hall:} You exist partly in the Hall of the Unfinished and the Feast that Circles. \textbf{Permanent Condition---Torn Between Worlds:} \textbf{--2 dice} to mundane tasks; \textbf{+2 dice} to creative or live performance.

\section*{Persistent Condition}
\label{sec:palinode-condition}
\textbf{Artist's Hunger}: \textbf{+2 dice} to creative expression and social performance; \textbf{--1 die} to rest, routine, or anything that interrupts flow. You live for the rush; ordinary life tastes grey.

\section*{Rivalries}
\label{sec:palinode-rivals}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Witness}---harsh truth vs. Palinode's beautiful lies.
\item \textbf{The Sealed Gate}---closed order vs. opened doors of inspiration.
\item \textbf{Maelstraeus}---cold calculation vs. warm rapture.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Where Her Hymn is Heard}
\label{sec:palinode-hooks}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Theona:} bride-feasts and moot songs that must never count to nine.
\item \textbf{Thepyrgos:} stair-choirs whose notes carry law.
\item \textbf{Vhasia:} tourneys where crowd-chants sway crowns.
\item \textbf{Vilikari:} laurel feasts where verdicts are sung.
\item \textbf{Zakov:} salt-lit taverns where contracts come in chorus.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Playtest: The Last House Standing}
\label{sec:palinode-playtest}
A beloved venue falls at dawn. Palinode offers one final performance the city will recall forever---if the troupe pays the price.
\begin{itemize}
\item Use \emph{Single True Note} for impossible lines; \emph{Hooked Chorus} to draw the needed audience.
\item Cast \emph{Crownpiece} to make the show immortal; \emph{Consecrated Stage} to ward off saboteurs.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Resolutions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Perfect Sacrifice}---burn out for legend (renown; permanent creative exhaustion).
\item \textbf{The Feast that Circles}---endless revel (immortality in revelry; identity thins).
\item \textbf{The Master's Balance}---great show, sustainable future (modest fame; continued growth).
\item \textbf{Walk Away}---freedom over myth (short-term loss; autonomy preserved).
\end{enumerate}
