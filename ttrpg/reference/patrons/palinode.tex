\subsection{Palinode, Queen of Encores (Performance \& Rapture)}
\textit{Lore.} Once a road-cantor who swore to reconcile feuding towns with procession and song, Palinode died between feasts with a chorus unfinished. Yet the refrain refused to end: it braided toasts, hymns, work-chants, and tavern rounds into a living current that still coils through markets and moots. Where a crowd leans forward and a maker holds breath, she arrives.

\noindent \textbf{Signs.} A cup that never quite empties; a candle that gutters only when silence reigns; a flawless bar or note that the hand cannot forget.

\noindent \textbf{Cantor's Temptation.} Palinode promises relief from solitude: an audience that always leans closer, a song that never dies, a bond that feels like family even if it devours you. Her rites grant the Cantor not only power but belonging—at the cost of their voice becoming more hers than their own.

\noindent \textbf{Whispered in Taverns.}
