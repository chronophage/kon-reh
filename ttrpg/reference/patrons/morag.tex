\subsubsection{Morag the Hag (Twilight Bargains \& Cruel Transformations)}
\textit{Lore.} At the hearth's edge, at the forest's rim, where roads knot and waters meet—there dwells Morag. She is crone, maiden, and monster in turn: a crooked shadow stirring her pot of bones, a red-eyed huntress prowling borderlands, a kindly grandmother who smiles too long. Every tale told of her is true, though never complete. She teaches that every gift has teeth, every kindness a snare, and every oath a trap.

Her sigil is the twisted knot, shifting between a heart and a noose. The wise make offerings at her crossroads, for bargains struck in her name echo across generations. She gives the desperate exactly what they ask for, and the clever almost what they want.

\paragraph*{Rites of Morag the Hag}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Crooked Thread (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A thread knotted three times while whispering a secret.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Entangle a small promise: the target suffers \(-1\) die when acting against it. Breaking it creates 1~SB (Hearts).\\
\textbf{Push It:} The knot blackens and burns the breaker: inflict Harm~1 (Curse).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Borrowed Face (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A crude mask of bark, clay, or wax.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Assume the likeness of one you've touched. Gain \(+2\) dice to Deception. Acquaintances may test Insight (DV~3).\\
\textbf{Push It:} The original weakens (1~Fatigue) while you wear their likeness. Generate 1~SB (Spades).

\paragraph*{Rite of Thorn and Blood \textnormal{\texttt{[OATH][CURSE]}} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Extended; Near; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Prick of blood from both parties on a thorn branch.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Bind a bargain. Breaking it inflicts Harm~2 (Curse) on the breaker and grants the other \(+1\) die for a scene.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Breach also starts a \emph{Doomed} clock~[4] that only Morag can erase.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex.}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Bone-Truth \textnormal{\texttt{[REVEAL]}} (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A bone carved with runes.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Ask three questions; target must answer or mark 1~SB (Hearts).\\
\textbf{Push It:} Lies become impossible on those truths—attempting causes Harm~1 (Curse).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex.}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Cauldron's Boil \textnormal{\texttt{[TRANSFORM]}} (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Extended; Zone; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A cauldron, three strange ingredients, and a ``price.''\\
\textbf{Effect:} Transform a body, place, or spell. Always lasting, always costly.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Transformation is perfect—but consequence is displaced to someone close, or begins a hidden clock.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier~III (\textit{Invoke:} 2 Boons).}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Crossroads Gambit \textnormal{\texttt{[OATH][BIND]}} (High, 12 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A crossroads stone, three silver pins, the tears of a willing fool.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Establish Morag's Court at a crossroads. All present must make a bargain or suffer \(-2\) dice to all social rolls. Bargains made gain \(+1\) Effect but breaking them costs double.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Court becomes binding across all realms—spirits and mortals alike are bound; mark \(+2\) Obligation.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier~III (\textit{Invoke:} 2 Boons).} \quad \emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Hag's True Transformation \textnormal{\texttt{[TRANSFORM][CURSE]}} (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Touch; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A mirror that shows only bones, a lock of hair from seven blood-relations, the last breath of a dying wish.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Grant true transformation—reshape essence, not just form. Target may change fundamental nature (mortal to immortal, human to beast, etc.) but loses one core aspect of former self permanently.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Transformation becomes contagious—nearby allies may also transform but risk losing their humanity; mark \(+2\) Obligation.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier~III (\textit{Invoke:} 2 Boons).} \quad \emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.
