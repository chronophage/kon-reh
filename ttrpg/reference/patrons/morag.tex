% --- Patron: Morag the Hag (Twilight Bargains & Cruel Transformations) ---

\subsubsection{Morag the Hag (Twilight Bargains \& Cruel Transformations)}
\textit{Lore.} At the hearth’s edge, at the forest’s rim, where roads knot and waters meet—there dwells Morag. She is crone, maiden, and monster in turn: a crooked shadow stirring her pot of bones, a red-eyed huntress prowling borderlands, a kindly grandmother who smiles too long. Every tale told of her is true, though never complete. She teaches that every gift has teeth, every kindness a snare, and every oath a trap.

Her sigil is the twisted knot, shifting between a heart and a noose. The wise make offerings at her crossroads, for bargains struck in her name echo across generations. She gives the desperate exactly what they ask for, and the clever almost what they want.
