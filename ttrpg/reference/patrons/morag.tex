\section{Patron Entry: Morag the Hag}
\label{patron:morag}

\subsection*{Lore}
Morag dwells at the edges of things---crossroads, shorelines, the borders between cultivated land and wild wood. She is ancient beyond measure, her form shifting between that of a wizened crone, a terrible maiden, and a creature of shadows and bone. Her voice carries the weight of countless bargains made and broken, and her laughter echoes with children's tears.  

Morag is the patron of those who seek power through cunning, transformation, and the manipulation of weakness. She offers gifts with hidden curses, teaches transformations that exact a price, and grants knowledge that burns the unworthy. Her realm is perpetual twilight, where hospitality is sacred law and breaking a promise carries penalties worse than death. Her sigil is a twisted knot that shifts between a heart and a noose.  

Those who bargain with Morag gain the ability to see hidden truths, twist fate, and transform themselves or others---but each gift deepens their entanglement in her web of obligations and curses.

\subsection*{Obligation}
Starts at 6 for Tier II characters, scaling with tier. Morag’s obligations are sticky and personal.

\subsection*{Rivalries}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Livaea (Temptation, Desire):} Tension---both manipulate desire, but Livaea tempts, Morag bargains.  
  \item \textbf{Aliyah (Curses \& Corruption):} Antagonism---Aliyah corrupts, Morag exacts payment.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hard Obligation Triggers}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Obligation 10+:} Morag appears to collect: demand betrayal, sacrifice, or corruption of someone close. Refusal means she turns against you through manipulation and curses.  
  \item \textbf{Obligation 12+:} Promises misfire, transformations backfire, and others distrust you. Requires a quest to prove worth or risk pariah status.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Bargain-Sight (Persistent Condition)}
Bonding deeply with Morag grants \textbf{Bargain-Sight}.  
Effect: +2 Insight to detect deception or hidden costs. Always see the price of deals, creating paranoia.  
Narrative: Excellent negotiator, but cynical and mistrustful; struggles with genuine bonds.
