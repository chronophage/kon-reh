% --- Patron: Morag the Hag (Faerie Bargains & Hidden Costs) ---

\subsection{Morag the Hag, Weaver of Hidden Costs (Faerie Bargains \& Hidden Costs)}
\textit{Lore.} In the hour between twilight and dawn, where borders thin and mortal cunning meets older cleverness, Morag sets her webs of bargain and consequence. She is the grandmother who offers exactly what you need, the forest crone with a perfect solution, the crossroads dweller who makes dreams come true—for a price that only reveals itself once the road bends back. Her wisdom is simple and sharp: every gift carries obligation, every kindness creates debt, and every wish must be paid in coin not named aloud.

Her bargains are never unfair—only incomplete. She grants what is promised; the true cost lies in what is unspoken, written in thorn-scratch, and due when the moon has turned thrice.

\begin{quote}
``She gives you the gold, but not the weight it carries. She grants your heart's desire, but not the hunger it awakens. She answers your plea, but not the price that pleases her. In Morag's court, every `yes' is a `yes, but\ldots''''
\end{quote}

\noindent\textbf{Domain Focus}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Hidden Obligations:} reading the unspoken costs in every bargain
  \item \textbf{Faerie Cunning:} strict courtesy, sharp clauses, old-road law
  \item \textbf{Hearth-Way Wisdom:} folk practice for spirits, thresholds, and natural justice
  \item \textbf{Consequential Magic:} power that always arrives with strings attached
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Unfinished Promise (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A half-written contract or a promise spoken but not sealed.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Frame a bargain with an escape clause only you understand. Gain \(+1\) die when the other party acts to fulfill their obligation; you may interpret ambiguous terms in your favor.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Borrowed Luck (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A token of good fortune from someone who recently succeeded.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Share in another's fresh success. Gain \(+2\) dice on one roll that benefits from their good fortune.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Luck spreads but creates debt—the original bearer suffers misfortune later; mark \textbf{1~SB (Hearts)}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Speaking Knot (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Cord or thread tied with counted knots while speaking the bargain.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Bind a promise with fae knots that tighten when broken. Both parties gain \(+1\) die while keeping the bargain; breaking it escalates consequences (Harm~1, then Harm~2, then \textit{Curse}).\\
\textbf{Push It:} The knots grow willful and seek payment from the breaker's kin; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Threefold Exchange (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Three items of equal seeming value but different true worth.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Broker a trade where each party yields hidden value. All participants gain \(+1\) die when the exchange benefits them; Morag claims the difference in true worth as her tithe.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The exchange binds across generations; mark \textbf{1~SB (Spades)} as ancestral debts stir.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Cauldron's Secret (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Extended; Zone; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A cauldron never yet empty, ingredients dearer than coin, and a willing gift of time.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Brew a solution to any problem, but the cauldron asks one more ingredient—one the brewer does not realize they are providing until too late.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The remedy works perfectly but breeds dependence—users must return or suffer withdrawal; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} Extended rite; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}. \ \emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Crossroads Court (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Zone; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A true crossroads at twilight, offerings set to the four ways, and the tears of one who bargained thrice.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Convene Morag's court: all present must bargain. Each pact grants a marked boon and hides a cost that will ripen at the worst time.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Judgments bind across realms and seasons; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation} and begin \textbf{Entangled Fates [6]}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} Extended rite; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}. \ \emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.

\midrule

\subsection*{Playstyle Notes}
Morag favors negotiators who read the \emph{said} and the \emph{meant} at once. She rewards courtesy kept, clauses counted, and solutions bought with clever coin. The cost is a life lived on ledgers: every boon with a braid, every kindness with a key.
