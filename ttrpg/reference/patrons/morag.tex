# % --- Patron: Morag the Hag (Bargains & Dark Transformation) ---

\subsubsection{Morag the Hag (Bargains \& Dark Transformation)}
\textit{Lore.} Morag dwells at the edges of things—crossroads, shorelines, the borders between cultivated land and wild wood. She is ancient beyond measure, her form shifting between that of a wizened crone, a terrible maiden, and a creature of shadows and bone. Her voice carries the weight of countless bargains made and broken, and her laughter echoes with children's tears.

Morag is the patron of those who seek power through cunning, transformation, and the manipulation of weakness. She offers gifts with hidden curses, teaches transformations that exact a price, and grants knowledge that burns the unworthy. Her realm is perpetual twilight, where hospitality is sacred law and breaking a promise carries penalties worse than death. Her sigil is a twisted knot that shifts between a heart and a noose.

Those who bargain with Morag gain the ability to see hidden truths, twist fate, and transform themselves or others—but each gift deepens their entanglement in her web of obligations and curses.
