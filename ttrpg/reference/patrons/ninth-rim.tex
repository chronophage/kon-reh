% --- Patron: The Ninth (Void & Erasure) ---

\subsubsection{The Ninth (Void \& Erasure)}
\textit{Lore.} The Ninth is the principle of absence made manifest—the space between thoughts, the silence between words, the gap where meaning should be. It doesn't destroy; it reveals what was never there. Those who serve the Ninth learn that reality is mostly illusion, held together by attention and belief. In the gaps, power waits.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Missing Piece (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} A deliberate omission (unsaid word, unmade mark, unfilled space).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Create one ``Gap'' token—a specific absence others ignore. You gain +1 die when exploiting this gap (sneaking through ignored door, using forgotten path). Allies can spend Boon to treat one failed roll as ``never happened'' (retcon).\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Gap becomes contagious—similar absences appear; mark 1 SB (Spades).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Unmapped Path (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self/Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Walk without leaving trace or mark path with erasable signs.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Gain [VOID] tag for this scene. Allies moving silently gain +1 die. Create 4-segment \emph{Unmapped Territory} clock (can be spent to make pursuers lose trail).\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Path loops back on itself; pursuers must test Wits (DV 3) or become lost.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Hollowed Shell \textnormal{[VOID]} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Object with symbolic meaning (wedding ring, contract, key).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Object becomes [HOLLOW]—loses all magical/social significance. Target suffers -1 die on rolls involving that object's purpose. You gain +1 die when acting as if the object never existed.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Hollowing spreads to related objects; mark 1 SB (Clubs).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Calculated Absence (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Remove one significant element (light source, leader, key witness).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Zone gains [GAP] tag. Enemies suffer -1 die to coordination rolls. You gain +1 die when exploiting the absence. Start 6-segment \emph{Strategic Void} clock (can downgrade complications).\\
\textbf{Push It:} Absence creates cascading gaps; mark 1 SB (Diamonds).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex \ (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).}

\paragraph{Rite of the Entropic Bloom \textnormal{[UNWARD][DISPEL]} (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Nine items arranged in diminishing pattern, then erased.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Zone becomes [ERODED]—all [WARD]s, minor enchantments, and artificial constructs suffer -2 dice. Reality becomes ``leaky''—information bleeds in/out.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Erosion becomes permanent; mark 2 SB (Spades/Clubs).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph{Rite of Perfect Stillness \textnormal{[WARD]} (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Self/Zone; No.}
\textbf{Materials:} Seal all sensory inputs (blindfold, earplugs, isolation chamber).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Enter [STILL] state. Immune to all social/magical effects but cannot act. Others in zone suffer -2 dice to perception. Can ``pause'' scene for later activation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Stillness becomes contagious; willing targets can join but mark +1 Obligation each.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III \ (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}).}\\
\emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.

\label{sec:ninth-corruption}

\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{1cm} p{5cm} p{5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Tier} & \textbf{Benefit} & \textbf{Cost / Quirk} \\
\midrule
1 & Gap Sense: +1 die to Notice when something important is missing or has been altered. & Blind Spot: Occasionally fail to notice obvious present details while focusing on absences. \\
\midrule
2 & Retcon Moment: Once per scene, declare one minor action ``never happened'' (undo one failed roll). & Memory Lag: Suffer 1 Fatigue when recalling recent events clearly. \\
\midrule
3 & Hollow Presence: Gain [VOID] tag naturally; +2 dice to Stealth and deception through omission. & Social Transparency: Suffer -1 die to emotional connection rolls; people sense your ``emptiness.'' \\
\midrule
4 & Erosion Field: Once per session, make a small area or concept become [ERODED] for one scene. & Reality Leaks: Suffer -1 die to rolls requiring stable reality; occasionally lose track of present moment. \\
\midrule
5 & Ninth's Insight: Once per session, see the ``gaps'' in any plan, story, or structure and exploit them automatically. & Identity Drift: Difficulty maintaining consistent personality; suffer -1 die to rolls requiring personal certainty. \\
\midrule
6+ & Perfect Absence: Once per session, create a temporary [VOID] zone where specific concepts, memories, or beings simply cease to exist for one scene. & Cosmic Erosion: Mark +2 Obligation when using; risk permanent loss of core aspects of self/relationships to the void. \\
