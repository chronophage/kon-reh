% --- Patron: The Ninth, Beyond Comprehension (Infinite Information & Unknowable Truths) ---

\subsection{The Ninth, Beyond Comprehension (Infinite Information \& Unknowable Truths)}
\textit{Lore.} Beyond the eighth figure of Sacred Geometry lies a rim no compass will hold. The Ninth is not absence but surplus: knowledge poured past the lip of any vessel, truth that overgrows the frame that seeks to bind it. Those who bend the knee at its lectern become conduits for impossible reckonings --- glimpsing patterns that cannot be kept whole inside a single skull. Each revelation purchases power at the price of living comfortably within the world's common measures.

\begin{quote}
``Eight figures bind the world; the Ninth overflows it. Drink, and remember that the cup forgets its shape before the song is done.''
\end{quote}

\noindent\textbf{Domain Focus}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Hyperdimensional Knowledge:} reckonings that do not fit a single plane or proof
  \item \textbf{Incomprehensible Truths:} insights that demand the seer be changed to hold them
  \item \textbf{Information Overflow:} boon and peril of minds run past their brim
  \item \textbf{Conceptual Transcendence:} thinking beyond the usual ledgers and names
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Ninth Figure (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A chalk figure with an ``impossible'' joint, or a reckoning worked toward infinity on slate.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Glimpse past the ordinary frame of measure. Gain \(+1\) die to \textit{Lore} or \textit{Investigation} when wrestling complex systems or many-layered problems.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Flooded Scriptorium (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} An overburdened ledger-hall, stacked codices, bell that tolls the copying-hour without cease.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Read faster than hands can turn pages. Ask three questions upon any topic that leaves a written wake; gain \(+2\) dice to rolls of analysis this scene.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The tide of knowing overruns its banks --- suffer \textbf{Fatigue 1} and mark \textbf{1~SB (Diamonds)} as overflow breeds complication.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Hypercognitive Lattice (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A brass-thought lattice, an orrery of inked threads, or a draught that sharpens memory.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Widen the mind's mouth. For this scene, treat your \textit{Wits} as \(+2\) higher for information-processing rolls; you may track several intricate streams at once.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The opening does not quite close: keep the boon, but suffer \(-1\) die to single-task focus; mark \textbf{1~SB (Clubs)}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Breaking Glyph (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Extended; Self; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Vigil in dim light, a water-clock, and a problem sworn not to be left half-seen.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Take one pattern whole. Choose a complex system, theory, or design and gain perfect internal grasp of it; receive \(+3\) dice to related knowledge rolls for the session.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Your tongue cannot carry what your mind now holds: you cannot clearly teach or translate this insight; mark \textbf{1~SB (Hearts)}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Endless Stacks (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A hall of mirrored shelves, wax-tablets without end, whispering leaves of vellum.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Raise a locus of overfull knowing. All present gain \(+2\) dice to information-work; knowledge may be drawn from unlikely sources. Start a \([6]\) \emph{Information Overload} clock --- as it fills, participants strain and fray.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The Stacks wake and demand tithe in understanding or memory; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}. \ \emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Ninth Revelation (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Self; Yes.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A fast from easy speech, a circle of unbroken figures, and vows to see past comfort.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Glimpse a shard of Ninth truth. Take one major insight that overleaps common frames --- perfect command of a knotty system, forecast of chaotic motion, or comprehension of an ``impossible'' relation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The shard sets in you like glass: gain \textbf{Transcendent Understanding} (see Corruption) and mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}. \ \emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.

\toprule
\textbf{Tier} & \textbf{Benefit} & \textbf{Cost / Quirk} \\
\midrule
1 & \textbf{Hyperawareness:} \(+1\) die to \textit{Notice} when patterns whisper that they matter. & \textbf{Starved for Text:} \(-1\) die in barren halls with little record or sign; you itch for a stream to read. \\
\midrule
2 & \textbf{Pattern Recognition:} Once/scene, see connections others miss within tangled accounts and signs. & \textbf{Scattered Threads:} Thoughts run in parallel; \(-1\) die to sustained, single-line focus. \\
\midrule
3 & \textbf{Data Synthesis:} Once/session, fuse vast reckonings at a glance into a usable answer. & \textbf{Tongue-Tied by Wonder:} \(-2\) dice to teach or clearly explain your deepest insights. \\
\midrule
4 & \textbf{Dimensional Insight:} Once/scene, take a problem from an ``impossible'' angle and treat a knot as if already loosened. & \textbf{Bent Sense:} Ordinary space and tasks feel ill-fit; \(-1\) die to plain spatial or mundane labors. \\
\midrule
5 & \textbf{Infinite Processing:} Once/session, render perfect analysis of any information system or record-trail. & \textbf{Concept Drift:} Common categories slip; \(-1\) die to easy company and familiar talk. \\
\midrule
6+ & \textbf{Ninth Awareness:} Once/session, look from outside the frame; for a heartbeat, the world aligns. & \textbf{Transcendent Fragmentation:} Mark \textbf{+3 Obligation}; risk standing only partly in the world, present and absent in turn. \\

\subsection*{Playstyle Notes}
The Ninth favors the patient reader of tangled ledgers and sky-signs alike. It rewards audacity in thought and the courage to let understanding change you. Its gifts turn riddles into roads --- and ask, in exchange, that you learn to live where words and measures fail.

\noindent\textbf{Emphasizes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Hyperdimensional Knowledge:} insights that escape a single page
  \item \textbf{Cognitive Expansion:} widening the mind to hold more than comfort allows
  \item \textbf{Pattern Transcendence:} seeing threads that run beneath names and weights
  \item \textbf{Information Synthesis:} binding many scraps into one true line
  \item \textbf{Conceptual Breakthrough:} stepping past the frame rather than painting within it
\end{itemize}
