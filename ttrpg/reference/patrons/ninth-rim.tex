\subsubsection{The Ninth (Void \& Erasure)}
\textit{Lore.} The Ninth is the principle of absence made manifest—the space between thoughts, the silence between words, the gap where meaning should be. It does not destroy; it reveals what was never there. Those who serve the Ninth learn that reality is mostly illusion, held together by attention and belief. In the gaps, power waits.

\paragraph*{Rites of the Ninth}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Missing Piece (Low, 4 XP)} \emph{Scene; Near; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A deliberate omission (unsaid word, unmade mark, unfilled space).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Create one ``Gap'' token—a specific absence others ignore. You gain \(+1\) die when exploiting this gap (sneaking through an ignored door, using a forgotten path). Allies can spend a Boon to treat one failed roll as ``never happened'' (retcon).\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \(+1\) Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Gap becomes contagious—similar absences appear; mark 1~SB (Spades).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar} \; (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).

\paragraph*{Rite of the Unmapped Path (Low, 5 XP)} \emph{Scene; Self/Zone; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Walk without leaving trace or mark path with erasable signs.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Gain \texttt{[VOID]} tag for this scene. Allies moving silently gain \(+1\) die. Create a 4-segment \emph{Unmapped Territory} clock (can be spent to make pursuers lose the trail).\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \(+1\) Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Path loops back on itself; pursuers must test Wits (DV~3) or become lost.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar} \; (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).

\paragraph*{Rite of the Hollowed Shell \textnormal{\texttt{[VOID]}} (Standard, 8 XP)} \emph{Scene; Touch; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Object with symbolic meaning (wedding ring, contract, key).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Object becomes \texttt{[HOLLOW]}—loses all magical/social significance. Target suffers \(-1\) die on rolls involving that object's purpose. You gain \(+1\) die when acting as if the object never existed.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Hollowing spreads to related objects; mark 1~SB (Clubs).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex} \; (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).

\paragraph*{Rite of the Calculated Absence (Standard, 7 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Remove one significant element (light source, leader, key witness).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Zone gains \texttt{[GAP]} tag. Enemies suffer \(-1\) die to coordination rolls. You gain \(+1\) die when exploiting the absence. Start a 6-segment \emph{Strategic Void} clock (can downgrade complications).\\
\textbf{Push It:} Absence creates cascading gaps; mark 1~SB (Diamonds).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex} \; (\textit{Invoke:} 1 Boon).

\paragraph*{Rite of the Entropic Bloom \textnormal{\texttt{[UNWARD][DISPEL]}} (High, 13 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Nine items arranged in diminishing pattern, then erased.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Zone becomes \texttt{[ERODED]}—all \texttt{[WARD]}s, minor enchantments, and artificial constructs suffer \(-2\) dice. Reality becomes ``leaky''—information bleeds in/out.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Erosion becomes permanent; mark 2~SB (Spades/Clubs).\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier~III} \; (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}). \;\; \emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph*{Rite of Perfect Stillness \textnormal{\texttt{[WARD]}} (High, 14 XP)} \emph{Extended; Self/Zone; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Seal all sensory inputs (blindfold, earplugs, isolation chamber).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Enter \texttt{[STILL]} state. Immune to all social/magical effects but cannot act. Others in zone suffer \(-2\) dice to perception. Can ``pause'' a scene for later activation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Stillness becomes contagious; willing targets can join but mark \(+1\) Obligation each.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier~III} \; (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}). \;\; \emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Consuming Void \textnormal{\texttt{[VOID][BANE]}} (High, 12 XP)} \emph{Scene; Zone; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A space where meaning has already begun to erode, a void-seed crystal, the last word of a forgotten language.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Create a spreading \texttt{[VOID]} zone that consumes conceptual presence. Within the zone: all named entities suffer \(-1\) die; abstract concepts become unstable; memories fade. Start an 8-segment \emph{Void Spread} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Void consumes physical presence—objects begin to fade from reality; mark \(+2\) Obligation.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier~III} \; (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}). \;\; \emph{Obligation:} 7 segments.

\paragraph*{Rite of Absolute Negation \textnormal{\texttt{[VOID][CURSE]}} (High, 15 XP)} \emph{Extended; Touch; No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} The complete erasure of a fundamental concept from a location, a null-point compass, the silence between heartbeats.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Target a specific concept, memory, or being for absolute negation. They become \texttt{[ERASED]}—ceasing to have ever existed in the target's awareness. Affected suffer \(-3\) dice to recall or reference the erased element.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Erasure becomes contagious—related concepts begin to fade; mark \(+2\) Obligation and start \emph{Conceptual Decay [6]} clock.\\
\emph{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier~III} \; (\textit{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons}). \;\; \emph{Obligation:} 8 segments.

\paragraph*{The Ninth's Corruption Table}

\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{1cm} p{5cm} p{5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Tier} & \textbf{Benefit} & \textbf{Cost / Quirk} \\
\midrule
1 & \textbf{Gap Sense:} \(+1\) die to Notice when something important is missing or has been altered. & \textbf{Blind Spot:} Occasionally fail to notice obvious present details while focusing on absences. \\
\midrule
2 & \textbf{Retcon Moment:} Once/scene, declare one minor action ``never happened'' (undo one failed roll). & \textbf{Memory Lag:} Suffer 1 Fatigue when recalling recent events clearly. \\
\midrule
3 & \textbf{Hollow Presence:} Gain \texttt{[VOID]} tag naturally; \(+2\) dice to Stealth and deception through omission. & \textbf{Social Transparency:} Suffer \(-1\) die to emotional-connection rolls; people sense your ``emptiness.'' \\
\midrule
4 & \textbf{Erosion Field:} Once/session, make a small area or concept become \texttt{[ERODED]} for one scene. & \textbf{Reality Leaks:} Suffer \(-1\) die to rolls requiring stable reality; occasionally lose track of the present moment. \\
\midrule
5 & \textbf{Ninth's Insight:} Once/session, see the ``gaps'' in any plan, story, or structure and exploit them automatically. & \textbf{Identity Drift:} Difficulty maintaining consistent personality; suffer \(-1\) die to rolls requiring personal certainty. \\
\midrule
6+ & \textbf{Perfect Absence:} Once/session, create a temporary \texttt{[VOID]} zone where specific concepts, memories, or beings simply cease to exist for one scene. & \textbf{Cosmic Erosion:} Mark \(+2\) Obligation when using; risk permanent loss of core aspects of self/relationships to the void. \newline \textbf{Void Incarnate:} Permanent condition—parts of your existence become optional; must make Wits + Resolve (DV~4) to maintain presence in social scenes or risk fading entirely. \\
