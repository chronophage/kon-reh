% Patron: The Ninth Rim — Void, Negation, Absence
% =========================

\subsubsection{The Ninth Rim (The Unseen Ninth) (Void, Negation, Absence)}
\label{patron:ninth-rim}
\textit{Lore.} Beyond the mapped heavens, past the counted stars, lies the Ninth Rim—an infinite expanse of nothingness that presses against the edges of the known. It is not merely empty space, but the \emph{antithesis} of existence itself. Where the Sacred Geometry carves clean lines and the Witness records truths, the Ninth Rim erases. It is the silence that swallows words, the gap where memory fades, the slow decay of certainty into doubt. It is the hunger of the void between thoughts, the cold that seeps into warmth until warmth is forgotten. Its followers learn to find power in subtraction, in the spaces between things, in the quiet unraveling of the ordered world. They are erasers, underminers, and those who seek the peace of oblivion or the strength found in true emptiness.

\paragraph{Patron's Gift (Imbuement).}
Once/scene as an action (cost: 1 Boon; requires \textbf{Thiasos}), touch an item to imbue it until scene end with \textbf{+1 Melee} and \textbf{+1 Stealth or Arcana} (when leveraging absence/concealment) (Thematic). \emph{Push It:} extend for one extra scene by marking \textbf{+1 Obligation}. Same-patron Gifts don’t stack; take the best. Dice bonuses respect the +3 cap.

\subsubsection*{Low Rites}

\paragraph{Rite of the Missing Note (Low)}
\emph{Duration: Instant; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A sound deliberately not made, or a word left unspoken.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Render a minor sound or visual detail imperceptible for the scene. Gain +1 die to Stealth or an action relying on that specific absence.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The absence becomes contagious, affecting a related sound/detail, but mark 1 SB (Spades) as the void's touch is noticed elsewhere.

\paragraph{Rite of the Unmapped Path (Low)}
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Walk a route without marking it, leaving no trace.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Gain +2 dice to Stealth or Evade when moving through a familiar area. Allies following your path gain +1 die if they do not speak or mark their passage.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Your passage becomes a temporary "gap" in space; briefly step "outside" a pursuer's perception, but arriving elsewhere requires a risky test (DV 4) or you risk being lost (GM discretion).

\subsubsection*{Standard Rites}

\paragraph{Rite of the Hollowed Shell \texttt{[VOID]} (Standard)}
\emph{Duration: Instant; Range: Touch; Stacking: No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} An object or concept tied to its purpose (a key to a lock, a vow to an oath).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Temporarily strip an object or abstract concept of its function or meaning. A key turns in a lock but opens nothing. A vow becomes just words. Target suffers -2 dice on one action tied to that function. Duration: Scene.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The effect lingers or spreads subtly; the key breaks, the vow is forgotten by others, but mark 1 SB (Clubs) as the void's influence destabilizes the object/concept further.

\paragraph{Rite of the Calculated Absence (Standard)}
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Zone; Stacking: No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Remove one significant item from a space (a chair, a book, a person).\\
\textbf{Effect:} The \emph{absence} of the removed element becomes palpable, creating a subtle wrongness. Enemies in the zone suffer -1 die to rolls requiring perception, memory, or comfort. You gain +1 die to rolls exploiting this disquiet.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The absence "pulls" at reality; minor items related to the removed thing begin to vanish or malfunction, but mark 1 SB (Diamonds) as the local reality resists the negation.

\subsubsection*{High Rites}

\paragraph{Rite of the Entropic Bloom \texttt{[UNWARD][DISPEL]} (High)}
\emph{Duration: Scene; Range: Zone; Stacking: No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} A circle drawn with a substance that sublimates or decays instantly (like frost or ash).\\
\textbf{Effect:} Create a zone where entropy accelerates. \texttt{[WARDS]} flicker and fade (+1 DV to sustain). Ongoing magical effects (like light or minor glamours) require a test (DV 3) or collapse. Mundane items age or become fragile. Duration: Scene.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action; mark \textbf{+1 Obligation} (some tables prefer +2—set at campaign start).\\
\textbf{Push It:} The effect is permanent in a small area, but mark 2 SB (Spades/Clubs) as reality tries to correct the anomaly.

\paragraph{Rite of the Perfect Stillness (High)}
\emph{Duration: Extended; Range: Self/Zone; Stacking: No.}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Complete isolation—no light, sound, or sensation for the duration of the ritual.\\
\textbf{Effect:} You (or the zone) enter a state of perfect negation. You become immune to all non-physical effects (social, magical, mental) for one scene, but cannot act or perceive. If cast on a zone, all activity ceases—no movement, no magic, no thought—like a paused moment.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} Extended ritual; mark \textbf{+2 Obligation}.\\
\textbf{Push It:} The stillness is "saved" and can be triggered later as an instant action once per arc, but the cost is immediate and severe: mark Harm 2 and +2 Obligation.

\paragraph{Patron Relationships.}
\textbf{Rival: The Witness.} Friction in places of forgotten truths or unreliable records. SB prompts: crucial facts slip, records crumble, confessions are silenced.\\
\textbf{Rival: The Sacred Geometry.} Conflict at points of decay or conceptual breakdown. SB prompts: lines warp, patterns degrade, structures fail.\\
\textbf{Opposed by: The Sealed Gate.} Tension at failing thresholds or thinning barriers. SB prompts: seals weaken, wards flicker, things slip through. The Sealed Gate's \texttt{[WARD]} and \texttt{[BANISH]} may be less effective or suffer backlash when the Ninth Rim's influence is strong.
