# % --- Patron: The Ninth (Void & Erasure) ---

\subsubsection{The Ninth (Void \& Erasure)}
\textit{Lore.} The Ninth is the cosmic void that presses against the edges of reality—the silence beyond the known universe. In the sacred game of Kon'reh, the Ninth Rim marks the spaces outside the board, where no pieces may tread and no moves may be made. It is the absence beyond comprehension, the emptiness that gnaws at the edges of order.

Once, there were Nine Rims—nine principles that upheld creation. But knowledge of the Ninth was lost in the Great Erasure, and with it, the balance that kept the void at bay. Now the Ninth bleeds through forgotten truths, missing memories, and the spaces between thoughts.

Those who serve the Ninth find power in absence, in erasure, in silence. They are erasers and underminers, shepherds of nothingness, seeking either the peace of oblivion or the strength hidden in emptiness. But each embrace of the void deepens cosmic forgetting, making the world less knowable.

Beyond the eighth Rim lies only silence. But silence has teeth, and forgetting has weight.
