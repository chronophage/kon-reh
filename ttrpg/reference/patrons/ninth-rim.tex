\subsection{The Ninth}
\label{patron:ninth}

\paragraph{Lore.}
The Ninth is the cosmic void that presses against the edges of reality—the silence beyond the known universe. In the sacred game of Kon'reh, the Ninth Rim marks the spaces outside the board, where no pieces may tread and no moves may be made. It is the absence beyond comprehension, the emptiness that gnaws at the edges of order.

Once, there were Nine Rims—nine principles that upheld creation. But knowledge of the Ninth was lost in the Great Erasure, and with it, the balance that kept the void at bay. Now the Ninth bleeds through forgotten truths, missing memories, and the spaces between thoughts.

Those who serve the Ninth find power in absence, in erasure, in silence. They are erasers and underminers, shepherds of nothingness, seeking either the peace of oblivion or the strength hidden in emptiness. But each embrace of the void deepens cosmic forgetting, making the world less knowable.  

\emph{``Beyond the eighth Rim lies only silence. But silence has teeth, and forgetting has weight.''}

\paragraph{Patron's Gift (Imbuement): Void's Embrace.}
Once per scene as an action (cost: 1 Boon; requires \emph{Thiasos}), touch an item or space to imbue it with absence until scene end, granting \textbf{+1 die} and \textbf{+1 Effect} when leveraging concealment, negation, or forgotten knowledge.  
\emph{Push It:} Extend one extra scene by marking +1 Obligation. The void’s influence is noticed elsewhere.

% --- Low Rites ---
\subsubsection*{Low Rites}

\textbf{Rite of the Missing Piece (Low).}  
\emph{Duration:} Scene; \emph{Range:} Near; \emph{Materials:} Something deliberately left undone or unspoken.  
Render a minor detail imperceptible for the scene. Gain +1 die to Stealth or actions exploiting that absence. Create a 4-segment \emph{Cosmic Forgetting} clock.  
\emph{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.  
\emph{Push It:} Absence spreads to a related detail; mark 1 SB (Spades).

\textbf{Rite of the Unmapped Path (Low).}  
\emph{Duration:} Scene; \emph{Range:} Self; \emph{Materials:} Walk unmarked, leaving no trace.  
Gain +2 dice to Stealth/Evade in familiar areas. Allies following silently gain +1 die. Start a 6-segment \emph{Forgotten Trail} clock.  
\emph{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.  
\emph{Push It:} Step briefly outside perception. Risk test (DV 4) or become Lost.

% --- Standard Rites ---
\subsubsection*{Standard Rites}

\textbf{Rite of the Hollowed Shell [VOID] (Standard).}  
\emph{Duration:} Scene; \emph{Range:} Touch; \emph{Materials:} An item tied to its function (a key, a vow).  
Strip an object or concept of purpose: keys fail, vows lose force. Target suffers -2 dice on one action tied to it. Begin a 4-segment \emph{Meaning Erosion} clock.  
\emph{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.  
\emph{Push It:} Effect lingers; mark 1 SB (Clubs).

\textbf{Rite of the Calculated Absence (Standard).}  
\emph{Duration:} Scene; \emph{Range:} Zone; \emph{Materials:} Remove a significant item.  
The absence unsettles all present. Enemies suffer -1 die to perception or memory; you gain +1 die exploiting it. Begin a 6-segment \emph{Void Hunger} clock.  
\emph{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +1 Obligation.  
\emph{Push It:} Absence pulls at related things; mark 1 SB (Diamonds).

% --- High Rites ---
\subsubsection*{High Rites}

\textbf{Rite of the Entropic Bloom [UNWARD][DISPEL] (High).}  
\emph{Duration:} Scene; \emph{Range:} Zone; \emph{Materials:} Circle of frost or ash that decays instantly.  
Create a zone of entropy. Wards flicker, minor magics collapse, items age or weaken. Start an 8-segment \emph{Reality Decay} clock.  
\emph{Invoke:} 1 action; mark +2 Obligation.  
\emph{Push It:} Make permanent in a small area; mark 2 SB (Spades/Clubs).

\textbf{Rite of the Perfect Stillness [WARD] (High).}  
\emph{Duration:} Extended; \emph{Range:} Self/Zone; \emph{Materials:} Total isolation (no light, sound, or sensation).  
Enter perfect negation. Immune to non-physical effects (social, magical, mental) but cannot act or perceive. If cast on a zone: all action ceases as if paused. Start a 6-segment \emph{Temporal Void} clock.  
\emph{Invoke:} Extended ritual; mark +3 Obligation.  
\emph{Push It:} Save the stillness to trigger later; mark Harm 2 and +2 Obligation.

% --- Traits ---
\paragraph{Obligation.} Starts at 6 (Tier II), scaling upward.

\paragraph{Hard Obligation Triggers.}  
\emph{Obligation 9+:} Erase something significant—knowledge, person, or opportunity—or GM spends 2 SB to impose cosmic forgetting.  
\emph{Obligation 11+:} Mark permanent Condition \emph{Hollow Self}: -2 dice to rolls of identity or self-knowledge until a quest restores memory.

\paragraph{Persistent Condition: Cosmic Forgetting.}  
\emph{Effect:} +2 dice for concealment or erasure; -1 die for detailed memory or knowledge.  
\emph{Narrative:} You perceive gaps in reality, but each use erodes your own certainty of self.

\paragraph{Rivalries.}  
\emph{The Sacred Geometry:} Opposition --- order vs. void.  
\emph{The Witness:} Tension --- revelation vs. forgetting.  
\emph{The Sealed Gate:} Friction --- preserved boundaries vs. eroded barriers.

\paragraph{Connection to Kon'reh.}  
In Kon'reh, the Ninth Rim is the space beyond the board, the unreachable move beyond strategy. Adepts speak of the ``Ninth Move''—a paradoxical tactic that cannot be played yet shapes the game. Mastery of the Ninth translates into reality by exploiting gaps where rules fail.

% --- Playtest ---
\paragraph{Playtest Scenario: The Library of Unwritten Books.}  
A great library holds not only books that exist, but those that could have been and never were. Its Ninth Section bleeds forgotten knowledge into the world.  

Examples:  
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Missing Piece:} Identify erased truths fueling the void.  
  \item \textbf{Hollowed Shell:} Strip meaning from written works.  
  \item \textbf{Entropic Bloom:} Contain entropy where too much forgotten knowledge resurfaces.  
  \item \textbf{Perfect Stillness:} Balance knowledge and forgetting by suspending action.  
\end{itemize}
