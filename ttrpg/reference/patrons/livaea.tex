\subsubsection{Livaea, the Crimson Courtier (Seduction \& Social Binding)}

\paragraph{Lore.}
In salons where wine flows like honey and words cut sharper than daggers, the Crimson Courtier holds court. She is the patron of those who would bind others not with webs, but with desire, obligation, and the sweet poison of whispered promises. Her followers are masters of the intimate covenant, the secret alliance, and the kiss that seals a fate.
