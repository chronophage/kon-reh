% --- Patron: Oath of Flame & Light (Dawn & Vows) ---

\subsection{Oath of Flame \& Light (Dawn \& Vows)}
\textit{Lore.} The Oath of Flame \& Light is no patron of half-measures. Its fire names, binds, and burns—demanding that those who swear within its radiance stand openly, speak truly, and pay the cost of keeping their word. At dawn altars, the sworn kindle sparks of consecrated fire; in battle, they blaze as torches that hold back the night. To follow this Oath is to live in public truth, with no shadow to hide in and no retreat from the vow once spoken.

The Oath appears in many guises across cultures:  
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Everflame} — the unquenchable fire of promise, carried from shrine to shrine by wandering priests.  
  \item \textbf{Adur}, the Light of Aeler — worshiped as the sun’s church-deity, whose flame consecrates oaths and consumes falsehood.  
  \item \textbf{Adar}, the Vilikari Dawnfire — invoked as a war-god of vows and vengeance, whose rising light marks those who break faith.  
  \item Others know the Oath only as \textit{the Flame} or \textit{the Watchfire}, a nameless fire that still demands truth and punishes betrayal.  
\end{itemize}

Wherever it manifests, the Oath of Flame \& Light remains the same unyielding power: to swear beneath its dawn is to bind one’s self to a truth that cannot be hidden, forgotten, or undone.
