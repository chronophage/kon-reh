% --- Patron: The Sealed Gate (Thresholds & Containment) ---

\subsection{The Sealed Gate (Thresholds \& Containment)}
\textit{Lore.} The Sealed Gate stands where realities meet, embodying the sacred power of thresholds, boundaries, and containment. Its followers are wardens, exorcists, and philosophers of separation who believe some things must be kept apart for the world to function. The Gate manifests as an impassive judge whose shifting sigils—binding runes, exclusion marks, or acceptance glyphs—determine what may cross.

\begin{quote}
``You define what passes and what remains. Every boundary remembers your judgment.''
\end{quote}

\paragraph*{Domain Focus}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Thresholds:} Doors, portals, borders between realms
\item \textbf{Containment:} Wards, bindings, imprisonment of dangerous forces  
\item \textbf{Exclusion:} Banishment, quarantine, protection through separation
\item \textbf{Permission:} Safe passage, authorized access, controlled crossing
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Rite of the Sealed Threshold (Low, 4 XP)} 
\emph{Scene; Touch; No Push}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Chalk, iron dust, or sanctified cord.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Mark a doorway or passage as sealed. Unauthorized crossing tests Spirit + Resolve (DV 3) or suffers Position penalty. Creates 4-segment \emph{Ward Integrity} clock.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action, mark +1 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Barrier becomes visible shimmer; +1 Obligation.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Key's Rebuke (Low, 5 XP)} 
\emph{Instant; Near; No Push}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Gesture of denial or barrier symbol.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Target must test Body + Resolve (DV 3) or be pushed back from threshold. On success, create \emph{Rebuke Echo} token granting +1 die to next boundary defense.\\
\textbf{Invoke:} 1 action, mark +1 Obligation.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Circle of Denial [WARD] (Standard, 8 XP)} 
\emph{Scene; Zone; Standard Push}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Salt ring, iron filings, or boundary stones.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Create protective circle. Supernatural beings test against caster's Spirit + Arcana (DV 4) to cross. Mortals suffer -2 dice to force entry. 6-segment \emph{Circle Integrity} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Circle becomes two-way barrier; +1 Obligation.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Writ of Passage [BIND] (Standard, 7 XP)} 
\emph{Scene; Zone; Standard Push}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Signed authorization or spoken permissions.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Designate authorized passage route. Allies gain Position +1 when using route. Unauthorized suffer -1 die to movement/stealth. 8-segment \emph{Writ Authority} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Extend authorization to additional allies; +1 Obligation.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Banishment Knot [BANISH] (High, 13 XP)} 
\emph{Instant; Near; High Push}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Knotted cord sealed with gate-sigil.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Target supernatural entity tests against caster's Spirit + Resolve (DV = entity Cap). Success forces immediate departure from scene. Failed attempt creates 4-segment \emph{Banishment Backlash} clock.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Banishment lasts until next moon phase; +2 Obligation.\\
\textbf{Obligation:} 7 segments base.

\paragraph*{Rite of the Consecrated Barrier [WARD][UNWARD] (High, 14 XP)} 
\emph{Extended; Large Zone; High Push}\\
\textbf{Materials:} Relics from three traditions, boundary markers, trespasser's acknowledgement.\\
\textbf{Effect:} Consecrate area against all unauthorized passage. Tests required scale with intrusion attempt severity. 10-segment \emph{Sacred Boundary} clock tracks barrier strength.\\
\textbf{Push It:} Make barrier semi-permanent (lasts 1 season); start \emph{Maintenance} [6] clock.\\
\textbf{Obligation:} 8 segments base.

\paragraph*{Playstyle Notes}
The Sealed Gate patron excels in defensive, control-oriented play. Followers shape battlefields through strategic boundary placement and become invaluable when dealing with supernatural intrusions or securing locations. The corruption progression naturally leads characters toward becoming immovable guardians at the cost of flexibility and freedom.
