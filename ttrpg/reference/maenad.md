**Build Summary & Playstyle:**

*   **Core Identity:** This character is a **frontline combat specialist** who blends **monastic martial prowess** with **divine revelry**. They are not a backline caster.
*   **Combat Role:** They engage in **melee**, using **Flurry Strike** and the **Horned Dance** Rite for high damage output and action economy. **Flowing Spirit Way** helps them absorb hits. **Disciplined Body** and **Iron Fist Way** provide baseline toughness and effectiveness.
*   **Support Role:** The **Inspire (Bonded)** talent is their primary non-combat contribution, providing reliable, once-per-scene boosts to a bonded ally and nearby companions.
*   **Utility/Rituals:** Low Rites handle specific needs (stealth, fear protection, unmasking foes). The **High Cantor** talent (if taken) opens access to potent Standard Rites for transformation or battlefield control, but at the cost of increased Corruption and potentially using the Obligation system.
*   **Resource Management:** Careful management of the **Corruption Clock** is crucial. Casting Thrysos Rites frequently will fill it, leading to gaining traits of revelry/corruption. The **Horned Dance** Rite is likely used regularly, adding 2-5 Corruption each time (depending on its Obligation Cost, likely 3-4).
*   **Narrative:** Play up the **duality** of disciplined ecstasy. In calm moments, they might seem serene or even scholarly (Lore, Performance). In combat or revel, they unleash controlled chaos. Their **Corruption** should reflect this – perhaps gaining minor quirks like an ever-present wild smile, an eye that gleams gold in firelight, or an uncanny ability to find wine in the direst circumstances. The **bonded companion** reinforces the communal aspect of their path.

This build provides a solid foundation for a Tier III character who is a unique blend of martial artist and ecstatic priestess, capable in combat, offering reliable support to allies, and wielding the unpredictable power of revelry through Torrent곘
