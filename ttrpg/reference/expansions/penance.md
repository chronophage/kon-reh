Lich’s Dungeon of Penance

A tragic, choice-driven dungeon crawl for Fate’s Edge. The lich’s lair is a self-imposed prison: each of the 30 floors reenacts a betrayal or loss. The party can resolve floors by combat, negotiation, or puzzle-solving, but the true victory is understanding.

How to Run This Adventure

Floor-as-Leg Procedure
	1.	Seed the Floor: Treat each floor as a Travel “leg.” Draw your seed (Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage) from a reskinned “Dungeon Deck,” or choose elements that match the listed floor. Highest rank sets the Floor Clock.
	2.	Set Position: Start at Controlled. Adjust during play for bold risks, insight, or rising backlash.
	3.	Track the Floor Clock [4–6]: Use [4] for compact scenes, [5] for tense puzzles/social play, [6] for complex combats or multifaceted dilemmas.
	4.	SB Economy = Revelation Engine: Prefer spending SB to reveal memory, raise stakes, or tilt loyalties over raw damage. Draw from the Deck of Consequences when the scene earns it (multiple 1s, spikes in tension) to color omens, debts, or emotional fallout.
	5.	End with a Choice: Each floor ends on a fork that reframes the lich. Choices tune Position for the next floor and unlock boons or burdens.

Deck Usage in the Dungeon
	•	Hearts: Shame, love, vows, memory-ghosts.
	•	Clubs: Breakage, traps, relentless pursuers.
	•	Diamonds: Wards, keys, rights of passage, bargains.
	•	Spades: Necromancy, omens, soul-anchors, whispers.

XP & Boons
	•	Award XP for discoveries, hard choices, embracing costs, and major objectives. Grant Boons for partials/misses and compassionate play; allow Boons to steady Position or reroll at pivotal moments.

Final Persuasion Clock
	•	The last floor is resolved via a Persuasion Clock [6–8] with three destinations: Continue Penance, Find Peace, Join the Living. Table and player choices across prior floors shift starting Position and DV. See the Final Floor at the end of the document.

Tone & Safety
	•	This adventure centralizes grief, broken vows, and contrition. Check lines/veils, use safety tools, and invite players to define what reconciliation looks like in this world.

⸻

Tiering & Difficulty Dials
	•	Party Tier I–II: Default clocks [4–5]; sparse reinforcements; SB favors revelations and single-issue conditions.
	•	Tier III+: More [6] clocks, layered wards, and factional crossfire; SB can call reinforcements, gear failure, or scene shifts in addition to revelations.

⸻

Entry: The Forbidden Library (Hook)

A silent archive under municipal seal; brittle chains anchor a violet door. Research exposes this dungeon’s purpose: a penitential labyrinth. Breaking the seal opens to the Landing Stair and a breeze like the last breath of a vow.

Skill Hooks: Lore (necromantic jurisprudence), Insight (contrition vs. cruelty), Tinker (seal-hardware), Arcana (sympathy lines).

Stakes: You descend to hold the lich accountable—or to free him.

Running Notes & Conversions
	•	Scaling Clocks: If the group is breezing through, upgrade [4] → [5] or add a Ward/Alert sub-clock keyed to a floor’s trap.
	•	Position Drift: Mercy, confession, and restitution raise Position next floor; cruelty or evasion drop it. Keep a simple toggle per PC.
	•	SB Spend Menu (Dungeon Flavor)
	•	1 SB: Memory whispers; +1 Supply segment; evidence goes missing.
	•	2 SB: Alarm raised; lose cover; a lesser guardian arrives; vow-echo asks a costly question.
	•	3 SB: Reinforcements; key gear breaks; rail tick to a larger tragedy.
	•	4+ SB: Trap springs; authority/omen arrives; scene shifts to harsher truth.
	•	Boons as Compassion: When players console, bury, confess, or repair—hand out Boons. Let them convert Boons to stabilize Position at moral cruxes.
	•	Deck Cadence: Aim for 1–2 Deck draws per session unless the table wants chaos. Translate results into fiction: omens, debts, vows—not just penalties.

⸻

Prep Shortcuts
	•	Make a Name Ledger: three columns—Harmed, Helped, Unresolved. Move names between columns as choices land.
	•	Keep a Shard Kit: mirror shard, ring, ledger scrap, bone-petal—physical tokens that move between floors to track themes.
	•	Sketch the lich in three moods: Proud, Weary, Resolved. Check one at the end of each session; bring that mask to Floor 30.

⸻

Rewards & Advancement
	•	This adventure is a major arc: award arc XP at resolution. Each floor can also grant small, flavorful boons (temporary tags, one-use rites, favors). Compassionate resolutions often trade immediate safety for long-term strength—lean into it.

⸻

Appendix: Quick Floor Hooks by Pillar
	•	Combat-forward: 3, 10, 12, 15, 17, 28
	•	Social-forward: 2, 4, 7, 13, 18, 30
	•	Puzzle/Investigation: 1, 5, 8, 11, 19, 29

Use as a one-shot (pick 6–8 floors), a short arc (12–16 floors), or the full penitence (all 30). The lich isn’t “defeated”—he’s convinced.

Floor Description Template — Lich’s Dungeon of Penance

Copy this block for each floor. Replace bracketed prompts with your details. Keep the Name-as-Key section tight—players should be able to solve it without esoteric trivia.

⸻

[Floor #] — [Floor Title]

Memory in One Line: [What did the lich do (or fail to do), in 1 honest sentence?]
Tone Tags: [e.g., contrition • frost • ceremony • whispers]
Start Position: Controlled / Risky / Desperate
Floor Clock: [4–6] — [What advances it? e.g., “cold shards fall, guests turn hostile, vows unravel”]

Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)

From the Lich’s Perspective:
[2–4 short paragraphs: what he wanted, what he feared, what he chose, what it cost. Include one specific sensory detail that repeats in the present (e.g., the smell of lilacs, the click of a cane, ash-snow).]

From the Harmed Party’s Perspective:
[1–2 paragraphs: what they lost, what justice would have looked like then, and how the dungeon refracts that wish now.]

Penance Sought:
[What the lich is trying to rehearse/repair here. Define a concrete act that would satisfy the spirit of the wrong (apology, restitution, renunciation, witnessing).]

⸻

Environment & Manifestations

Space: [room(s), terrain, lighting, repeating motif]
Anchors: [3–5 set pieces that “hold” the memory—altar, ledger, mirror, clock, ring, shard, name-stone]
Senses: [sound/odor/temp sensations that escalate with the clock]
Adversaries/Agents: [who appears, why they act—
memory-echo bride, mask-enforcers, bonewights, censors of the senate, etc.]

⸻

Handles & Difficulty

Approaches (Handles):
	•	[Handle] → [what it does] (DV [ ])
	•	[Handle] → [what it does] (DV [ ])
	•	[Handle] → [what it does] (DV [ ])
	•	[Handle] → [what it does] (DV [ ])

Position Drift:
[What raises Position next floor? What drops it? Tie to mercy/cruelty/confession.]

When the Floor Clock Fills:
[Immediate fiction + consequence (harm, separation, scene shift, oath enforced).]

⸻

SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)
	•	1 SB: [small truth shows / lose footing / a token goes missing].
	•	2 SB: [accusatory chorus / ward flares / ally demand].
	•	3 SB: [reinforcement arrives / gear failure / memory intensifies].
	•	4+ SB: [scene shift / omen arrives / binding compels a costly choice].

Deck of Consequences: [when/why to draw; what kinds of fallout it paints—omens, debts, vows]

⸻

The Name-as-Key

Each floor is locked by a true name tied to the betrayal. Discovering and correctly using it is the cleanest exit. Combat or workarounds are possible but risk harsher downstream costs.

Key Name: [e.g., “ALYSSA OF THE WHITE LILIES,” “THE OATH CALLED THRESHOLD,” “MASTER RHEM, INK-THIEF”]
Why This Name Matters: [The moral hinge—what speaking/writing/restoring this name honors or admits]

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
	•	Acrostic: [initial letters of guest ledgers, hymn verses, shelf tags]
	•	Palimpsest: [scraped text legible only under ash/steam/moonlight/tears]
	•	Backmask: [spoken backward by echo-choir; correct with counter-chant]
	•	Syllable Scavenger: [3–5 fragments tied to set pieces]
	•	Taboo Hearing: [name audible only after an apology / act of restitution]
	•	Emotional Key: [appears when a PC chooses compassion over advantage]
	•	Ledger Lock: [must be written with a specific tool/ink on a named page]

Clue Ladder:
	•	Gentle Nudge: [obvious surface hint—flowers carved like letters; bell tolls count]
	•	Actionable Lead: [requires a handle—Evidence to align accounts; Arcana to reveal ink]
	•	Aha! Proof: [confirms the full name; no ambiguity]

Extraction Test:
[What roll/ritual secures the name? Include failure cost that reveals more truth over damage.]

Verification & Use:
[How to “spend” the name to open the way—speak in stillness, inscribe in ledgers, return an object while saying it. What happens on mispronunciation or false names?]

⸻

Resolution Fork

Mercy: [What mercy looks like here; boon granted; Position effect]
Restitution: [Concrete payment/repair; boon; introduces Debt or Obligation]
Renunciation: [Reject the old power; short-term cost; long-term grace]

Pick at least two nonviolent exits. Let violence function but at a moral premium (Stain, public memory turns against you, etc.).

⸻

Outcomes & Carry-Forward

Boons: [name/type/uses]
Burdens: [Stain, Curse, Obligation clocks]
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: [ ] • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]
Shard Kit: [which token persists—ring, shard, ledger scrap—and what it does later]
Links: [which later floors reference this; how mercies reduce the Final Persuasion DV]

⸻

Boxed Text (Optional)

Entry Read-Aloud:
[2–5 vivid sentences to set scene; one recurring motif from Extended Lore.]

Exit Beat:
[A brief image that confirms the chosen resolution—candles steady, ledger page dries, name returns to a headstone.]

Mini Example (Floor 7: The Broken Vow)

Memory in One Line: He left his wedding mid-ritual to chase discovery.
Tone Tags: contrition • frost • ceremony • hush
Start Position: Controlled
Floor Clock: [6] — Shards of cold fall; vows unravel; guests awaken hostile.

Extended Lore: He believed a perfect theorem could spare future grief, and so he traded the present for the promise. She stood alone with a vow in her mouth and a ring gone cold. The aisle’s frost is the breath of every apology he never learned to make.

Penance Sought: To witness a vow completed without him—and bless it.

Environment: A chapel of ice, pews under hoarfrost; a choir that sings syllables backward; a ring on a pedestal sweating cold.

Handles: Presence (ask consent to continue the rite, DV 2); Rites (bind a surrogate witnessing, DV 3); Wits (trace the escape sigil, DV 2).

SB Spends: 1—petals turn to cutting glass; 2—choir accuses; 4—the ring binds a PC to prove fidelity.

The Name-as-Key:
	•	Key Name: “ALYSSA WHITE-LILY.”
	•	Why It Matters: Restoring her full name acknowledges she was more than the wound she became.
	•	Hidden: Acrostic across pew placards (first letters of family rows) + Taboo Hearing (only audible after a PC publicly commits to a kindness).
	•	Clue Ladder: Gentle—lilies carved on the aisle; Actionable—choir sings a phrase that becomes legible when the ring warms; Aha—steam reveals the palimpsest on the lectern.
	•	Extraction: Evidence or Arcana to restore the lectern’s palimpsest (on fail, the frost spreads but reveals her middle name).
	•	Verification & Use: Speak her name while placing the ring on the pedestal’s warmer; mispronunciations crack the ring (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

Resolution Fork: Mercy—bless a new vow (boon: Blessing vs undead); Restitution—donate a treasured item to her family row (Debt 1); Renunciation—break the escape sigil and stay through the ritual (lose time, gain Public Grace later).

Outcomes & Carry-Forward: Boon—Bride’s Favor (once: steady Position); Burden—Cold Curse if you reject; Ledger—Helped: Alyssa; Shard—frosted ring grants +1d to sincere apologies later; Link—reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you honored her name.

Entry: Frost-laced petals hang in the air, refusing to fall. The choir inhales a vow backward.

Exit: The frost melts into dew; lilies breathe; the aisle warms under your steps.

Final Floor — The Last Light (revised)
	•	Memory: He chose lichdom to pay for everything—and to be unable to stop paying.
	•	Environment: A quiet study of candles. Thirty flames, each the height of a floor you climbed. The lich sits unarmed; the air is bright with names unsaid.
	•	Start Position: Controlled if you showed mercy/restitution on ≥10 floors; Risky otherwise. Any violent approach starts Desperate.

Optimal Resolution: Nonviolent
	•	Primary Clock: Persuasion [6–8] (6 for merciful runs, 8 for mixed).
Handles: Sway/Presence (argue the end of penance), Insight (name what he fears to lose), Evidence (lay the ledger), Rites (open a door beyond).
	•	Name-Litany Bonus: For each unique Key Name recovered this run, mark +1 progress on the Persuasion Clock (max +6 from names).
	•	Auto-Succeed — Recite the Thirty: If the party recites all 30 true names, in order or as a coherent litany, the Persuasion Clock immediately completes.

SB Spends (nonviolent):
2—Candles gutter images of those you saved. 3—A beloved echo begs you to forbid forgiveness. 4—Scene shift: you argue inside one of the memories; stakes double.

The Thirty-Spoken (Name-Litany Rite)
	•	Requirements: All thirty Key Names, plus at least one Shard Kit token from three different floors.
	•	Test: One PC leads the litany (Rites or Presence, DV 2–3). Others Aid by offering tokens or short remembrances.
	•	Risk: Mispronunciations/omissions tick Memory Collapse [4] (fractured scene; +1 DV until mended).
	•	Effect: On success, the lich yields and accepts your judgment (choose an ending). On failure, you still fill segments equal to correctly spoken names before the error.

Violent Resolution (Daring, Suboptimal)
	•	Unfettered Lich (Phase Boss)
	•	Wards: Immune to mundane harm; harm only lands in an exchange where a PC invokes a true Key Name tied to a past wrong.
	•	Phylactery: The unlit thirty-first candle. Find with Insight (what isn’t grieving) or Arcana (trace sympathy), DV 3.
	•	SB Spends (violent): 1—Soul-fire lashes (scorch harm). 2—Gear failure. 3—Memory collapse (split-arena). 4—Cataclysmic ward (choose: harm 2, or fall/lose footing and -1 Position next scene).
	•	Kill Condition: Reduce him to cinders and snuff the thirty-first candle while speaking any true Key Name. Otherwise he reforms at dusk.
	•	Cost: Violent victory denies the full blessing of the relic and marks Stain on the Name Ledger; merciful echoes turn against you.

Endings
	•	Continue Penance: He seals himself deeper. Gain Fetter’s Boon (1/session erase 1 SB from a roll; GM banks +1 SB). The stair closes for a year and a day.
	•	Find Peace: He passes onward; a Soul-Light remains (1/arc: shift Desperate → Controlled for one scene).
	•	Join You: He returns in frail flesh; a Mortal Oath binds him against a named greater threat. Track Debt [4] that ticks on misuse.

Treasure—Only if The Thirty-Spoken: When the party recites all 30 names and he yields, he bequeaths the Glaive of the Thirty (below). If he’s slain, only a fine (non-enchanted) glaive lies here unless later awakened by returning at least ten names to the living record.

Relic: Glaive of the Thirty (Enchanted)

A two-handed polearm of pale iron, its edge etched with faint, incomplete names that brighten when spoken with care.
	•	Tags: reach • two-handed • solemn • name-bound
	•	Attunement: Fully awakens only if the party recited all 30 names at the final floor. Otherwise it functions as masterwork steel.

Boons
	•	Litany Edge (1/session): Speak a true name from your Name Ledger while striking or standing guard → steady Position one step or +1 effect vs undead, oath-spirits, bound shades.
	•	Mercy Carried Forward (1/arc): When you choose a nonviolent exit in a scene of grievous harm, clear 1 segment from an active Doom/Alert/Ward sub-clock.
	•	Witness’s Reach (passive): When defending the powerless or honoring the harmed, gain +1d on the first relevant action of the scene.

Costs & Limits
	•	Name Hunger: Each use of Litany Edge consumes one distinct name for this arc (no repeats until next arc).
	•	Contrition Bound: If you cut down a pleading foe without offering terms, mark Stain; the glaive goes dormant until you restore a name to the world (public restitution, grave restored, ledger repaired).

Awakening After Violence
	•	If claimed through combat, the relic may awaken after the party returns 10+ names to the living record. When it stirs, each bearer feels a brief weight on the shoulder—like a hand asking for gentleness.

The Penitent Lich — Runekeeper Patron

A Patron of names kept, vows witnessed, and debts made visible. Power flows through confession, restitution, and the binding force of true names.

What the Penitent Lich Is

Once mortal, now an anchor of memory. He refuses oblivion until every name he harmed is spoken correctly and set in its rightful place. He grants power to those who lift names, keep watches, and choose mercy first.

Portfolio: true names • oaths • remembrance • wards • restitution
Symbols: a guttering candle; a ledger ribbon; a ring that won’t warm; a mirror shard.
Favored Deeds: return a name to the world; bury the unburied; witness a vow without centering yourself; refuse an easy cruelty.

⸻

Tenets (Keep These)
	1.	Name the Harmed: When you act, speak who is owed—not what you want.
	2.	Mercy Before Might: Try a nonviolent avenue before you draw steel or spell.
	3.	Watches Are Kept, Not Owned: If you take a ward, keep it—or find a worthy keeper.
	4.	Debt Is Not Silence: Confess, repair, and let the record show it.
	5.	No Erasures: Do not profit by deleting names, histories, or lineages.

⸻

Runekeeper: What You Get

When you swear to the Penitent Lich as Runekeeper, you learn to inscribe small, portable bindings called runes. Each rune is a single-use inscription prepared during downtime or a quiet scene.
	•	Preparing Runes: In downtime, prepare 2 runes from your list; carry at most 3 at a time. You may overwrite an unspent rune by marking Obligation to the Patron.
	•	Invoking Runes: Invoking a rune is usually Controlled and takes a quick action unless the scene is in chaos (then Risky).
	•	Interacting with Position/DV: Runes usually raise Position one step or give +1 effect toward their stated sphere.

⸻

Devotions & Boons

Track your standing with the Penitent Lich as Favor [0–5]. Increase Favor by naming the harmed, choosing restitution, keeping hard watches, or completing a rite of remembrance. Decrease Favor by erasing names, refusing confession, or striking down a pleading foe without terms.

Favor 0 — Initiate of the Ledger
	•	Patron Gift — Rune: Mark of Witness: Chalk or ash mark that steadies Position once per scene when you defend the powerless or truth.
	•	Prayer—Soft Candle: Once per session, dim a scene’s hostility: -1 segment from an active Doom/Alert/Ward sub-clock after you speak who is being protected.

Favor 1 — Keeper of the Door
	•	Rune: Threshold: Place on a doorway/line. For one scene, allies crossing it get +1d to resist separation or ambush.
	•	Boon—Confessor’s Ears: In a social exchange where you admit a fault, gain +1d to read motive (Insight-type handles) this scene.

Favor 2 — Binder of Names
	•	Rune: True Name: Inscribe a true name on cloth/metal. For one action that targets the named (aid or oppose), choose: +1 effect or steady Position. If used to harm, mark Stain unless you offered terms first.
	•	Boon—Ledger Glimpse: Once per session, ask the GM: “What would restitution look like here?” Gain a concrete, actionable step.

Favor 3 — Warden of Restitution
	•	Rune: Redress: Break this seal to clear 2 segments from a Debt/Obligation clock you owe—but you must immediately perform a small, public act of repair.
	•	Boon—Vigil: When you keep watch over a warded thing for a full scene, everyone on your side begins the next scene one Position higher.

Favor 4 — Litany-Bearer
	•	Rune: Litany: Speak a short list of rightful names. For the next minute, your side treats the scene’s first Desperate roll as Controlled. Consumes one distinct name from your Name Ledger.
	•	Boon—Mercy Carried Forward: When you choose a nonviolent exit in a grievous scene, remove 1 segment from a Memory/Alert clock.

Favor 5 — Keeper of the Last Light
	•	Rite: The Thirty-Spoken: If your Ledger holds 30 true names from a single penitential place, you may resolve a confrontation with persuasion instead of violence; on success, also refresh one spent rune.
	•	Boon—Absolution’s Edge: Once per arc, declare immunity to fear/charm for your party in a scene where you speak for the harmed.

⸻

Runes (Runekeeper List)

Pick from these when you prepare:
	•	Witness: Mark a surface; your side gets +1 effect to protect witnesses or evidence this scene.
	•	Threshold: See Favor 1.
	•	True Name: See Favor 2.
	•	Redress: See Favor 3.
	•	Peace: Anyone who voluntarily sheaths a weapon within arm’s reach of this rune gains +1d to their next social action in this scene.
	•	Rest: Set by a body or grave; undead entering must test (DV 2). On fail, they hesitate and reveal who they were.
	•	Atonement: Place on an object tied to harm; returning it to its rightful keeper steadies Position for your group and creates a minor Boons token.

⸻

Rites & Invocations
	•	Candle of Remembrance (scene): Light a small candle and speak a harmed name. For this scene, you may re-roll 1s once on a social or investigation action that centers that person.
	•	Seal of Safe Passage (scene): Trace a circle and recite three names you have helped. For the next crossing (gate, bridge, alley), reduce the first Ward/Alert sub-clock you trigger by 1.
	•	Confessor’s Vigil (downtime): Keep watch at a threshold named in your Ledger. Clear 1 stress/strain and prepare 1 extra rune next downtime.

⸻

Compels & Taboos

Compel (GM Tool): Offer a boon or clear 1 segment of an impending trouble if the Runekeeper attempts a nonviolent option first. Refusing marks Stain or loses 1 Favor (player’s choice).
Taboos (Break = lose 1–2 Favor): Erase a name for gain; profit from falsified records; abandon a sworn watch without successor; kill a pleading foe without terms.

⸻

Offerings & Obligations
	•	Restore a headstone or ledger page.
	•	Return a stolen token (ring, book, oath-stone).
	•	Keep a night’s watch for someone who cannot.
	•	Publicly confess a relevant fault and make a concrete repair.

Mark Obligation [4] when you take aid without an offering. Fulfilling a listed offering clears 2 segments.

⸻

Synergy: Glaive of the Thirty

If your party earned the Glaive of the Thirty, you may speak a Ledger name while guarding or striking to gain +1 effect or steady Position (once/scene). Re-using the same name before the next arc marks Stain.

⸻

Using This Patron in the Lich’s Dungeon
	•	Name Ledger: Keep three columns: Harmed / Helped / Unresolved. Moving names from Unresolved → Helped is how you organically earn Favor.
	•	SB Spending Guidance: Spend SB to reveal truths, tighten oaths, or summon witnesses, not just to spike harm.
	•	Nonviolent First: With this Patron, players should feel tangible benefits for choosing mercy—Position bump, DV hints, and clock relief.

⸻

Example Invocations
	•	“By the breath that warmed ALYSSA WHITE-LILY’s ring, let no vow be mocked while this mark holds.”
	•	“Threshold, keep—the harmed may pass before the hungry.”
	•	“Ledger, open—show me what restitution looks like, not what is easy.”

⸻

GM Notes (Quick)
	•	Favor should move. Reward visible repair. Make taboos costly but recoverable through clean acts.
	•	When in doubt, let a rune raise Position or grant +1 effect toward mercy, truth, or watchkeeping rather than raw damage.

Penitential Corruption — Tables & Rules (Fate’s Edge)

Use this when the dungeon’s necromancy stains the soul, when names are erased, or when the party spurns mercy. It integrates with Position, DV, SB, the Deck of Consequences, and the Name Ledger.

⸻

How Corruption Works
	•	When to Roll: Gain Minor Corruption on small cruelties (breaking etiquette of remembrance, exploiting grief, petty desecrations). Gain Major Corruption for taboos (erasing a name, killing a pleading foe without terms, shattering a ward, stealing a ritual for profit, phylactery desecration without rites).
	•	Track: Each PC keeps a Corruption [0–6] track. Each roll adds +1 Corruption first, then you roll on the relevant table. Some results add more.
	•	Stain vs. Corruption: Stain is a narrative tag that can clear through play; Corruption is a mechanical track with thresholds below.
	•	GM SB Hook: In scenes of cruelty or erasure, the GM may spend 2 SB to force a Minor Corruption roll (once/scene).
	•	Name Ledger Hook: At Corruption ≥3, you cannot move any name from Unresolved → Helped without public restitution.

Thresholds
	•	3+ Corruption: Choose a Mark (visible stigma). Deception about your past suffers DV +1. You cannot exceed Favor 3 with the Penitent Lich until you reduce to ≤2.
	•	6 Corruption: You are Oath-Bound Revenant until cleansing (see below): all violent actions start Desperate; Glaive of the Thirty (if held) goes dormant; a personal Haunt follows you as a GM tool.

Cleansing Corruption (pick/stack as fiction allows)
	•	Public Confession + Concrete Restitution: -1
	•	Bury the Unburied / Restore a Headstone or Ledger Page: -1
	•	Keep a Named Vigil (one full scene) at a relevant threshold: -1
	•	Return a Stolen Token to its rightful keeper: -1
	•	Restore a Lineage / Undo an Erasure: -2
	•	The Thirty-Spoken (leader only): set Corruption to 0

⸻

Table A — Minor Corruption (d12)

Roll when you take a petty cruelty or minor desecration.
	1.	Cold Breath: Your breath steams in warm rooms. The first time you draw a weapon each scene, tick Alert +1 segment.
	2.	Ink-Fingers: Black ink stains your hands. Evidence-type actions suffer DV +1 unless you start by admitting a relevant fault.
	3.	Wrong-Whisper: Echoes misname you. Sway vs any harmed party is -1d unless you begin with acknowledgment; on acknowledgment, steady Position.
	4.	Guttering Candle: Nearby flames flutter toward you. When you lie about the past, immediately draw the Deck of Consequences.
	5.	Numb Grip: Fingers won’t warm. Your first delicate action each scene (Tinker/Theft/etc.) starts Risky unless you carry a token of the harmed.
	6.	Cold Ring: A band bites your finger. If you break a promise this scene, tick a Memory Collapse [4] sub-clock +1.
	7.	Skittering Shadow: Your shadow jitters. Stealth starts Risky unless you spoke a true name today.
	8.	Frosted Mirror: Your reflection fogs first. When acting from self-deception, DV +1; if you speak your true name, ignore this for the scene.
	9.	Ash in Pocket: Coin spent for selfish gain becomes an IOU; tick Obligation +1 segment (to anyone harmed by the scene).
	10.	Blurred Margins: Names blur at the edges of pages. Once/scene the GM may ask, “Whose name is missing?” If you cannot answer, Position -1.
	11.	Hollow Step: Floors creak beneath you. Endure-type resists cost +1 stress/strain unless defending the powerless.
	12.	Bleeding Ledger: When you destroy a record, mark Stain and roll Minor Corruption again.

⸻

Table B — Major Corruption (d12)

Roll when you violate a taboo or commit a grievous erasure.
	1.	Counting Shadow: Your shadow counts softly. At Dusk, accept a Compel to attempt a nonviolent option first or mark Stain.
	2.	The Unlit Candle: A thirty-first candle won’t catch. Undead prefer you as a target, but you gain +1 effect on Rites after confession.
	3.	Tongue of Ash: Mispronouncing a true name adds +1 segment to Persuasion/Memory Collapse and locks that name until restitution.
	4.	Name-Scar: Healed wounds etch a name you can’t say. Choose an NPC’s name you are unable to speak until you perform a fitting repair.
	5.	Frosted Vows: Your touch chills vows. Allies start the next social scene Risky unless you consecrate with Rune: Witness.
	6.	Mirror-Shard Soul: On being reduced to 0, you split into two conflicting drives for one scene (GM tool) until healed by a Vigil.
	7.	Debtor’s Sigil: Mark Obligation [4] to the Patron. Until cleared, you cannot invoke the same Litany or Glaive name twice per arc.
	8.	Name-Eater: On a critical failure, one random name moves from Helped → Unresolved; gain +1d to your immediate follow-up and mark Stain.
	9.	Ash Crown: Authority senses your usurpations: DV +1 vs authority until you abdicate something tangible.
	10.	Counting Bells: Time slips. Each long action you take also ticks Alert/Ward +1 unless a harmed witness is present.
	11.	Empty Pall: Your healing helps half unless accompanied by a spoken apology tied to the scene.
	12.	Candle Tax: SB spent against you in a memory-scene has +1 potency (or GM pays 1 less SB) unless a PC reads a harmed name aloud at scene start.

⸻

Party Miasma (Optional Group Track)

When multiple PCs commit erasures in one episode, tick Miasma [0–6].
	•	3+: All scenes start Position -1 until the group performs a public act of repair together.
	•	6: The dungeon rejects the party—advance each active clock +1 and introduce a roaming Haunt until you restore a lineage or bury the unburied.

⸻

Deck Integration (Quick)

When a result calls for a Deck draw, interpret: Hearts—remembrance, Clubs—pressures, Diamonds—obligations, Spades—omens/necromancy. Use rank for severity.

⸻

Runekeeper & Glaive Interactions
	•	Runekeeper: Rune: True Name and Rune: Litany cannot be used to harm without offering terms; doing so adds +1 Corruption (then roll Minor).
	•	Glaive of the Thirty: For each point of Corruption, remove one distinct name from being used with Litany Edge until the next arc or until cleansed.

⸻

GM Usage Notes
	•	Point to visible marks; make Corruption felt in mirrors, candles, ledgers, and vows.
	•	Make cleansing specific and public; reductions should be stories, not toggles.
	•	Keep the table punchy: roll once, narrate hard, show how mercy re-opens safe play.


# Lich’s Dungeon of Penance — Floor Descriptions

## 1 — The Abandoned Apprentice

**Memory in One Line:** He left his first student locked out of the rite to claim credit.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • workshop • betrayal • stolen knowledge
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [5] — Tools hum louder; chalk-circle sparks; memory-constructs awaken.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich’s Perspective:
He believed mastery could only be earned through trial by fire, not gentle guidance. The student was weak, he told himself—better to let them fail and learn resilience than to coddle them into dependency. But the truth was simpler: he feared being surpassed, so he denied his apprentice access to the ritual that would have made them both powerful. The chalk-circle still bears scorch marks from where the rejected initiate tried to breach it.

From the Harmed Party’s Perspective:
The apprentice had waited years for this moment—years of servitude, of fetching components and cleaning vessels, all for a chance to finally become something more than a glorified servant. Denied entry, they fled into the night, their dreams of greatness reduced to ash. What justice would have looked like then was simple: inclusion, recognition, a fair chance to prove themselves.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his apprentice’s worth and give them the credit they were denied.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: A workshop bisected by a glowing chalk-circle; arcane implements hum with residual charge.
Anchors: Chalk-circle, apprentice’s notes, master’s grimoire, construct servitors
Senses: The scent of ozone and burnt parchment; the faint sound of weeping echoing from within the circle
Adversaries/Agents: Memory-constructs of failed apprentices, spectral echoes of rejected students

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Arcana → Counter the glyph's binding pattern (DV 3)
• Sway → Validate the apprentice-echo's grievances (DV 2)
• Tinker → Ground the circle's energy discharge (DV 3)
• Skirmish → Shatter the memory-constructs (DV 2)

Position Drift:
Mercy (validating the apprentice) raises Position next floor; cruelty (destroying evidence) drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
The circle erupts in wild energy, summoning additional constructs while the apprentice's notes begin to burn themselves unreadable.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: The apprentice’s notes accuse a small theft of credit.
• 2 SB: Ward backlash binds a PC’s shadow to the circle.
• 3 SB: A hidden chamber reveals the true extent of the apprentice's potential.
• 4+ SB: The master's grimoire opens to a page showing the ritual the apprentice was denied.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the circle's energy becomes unstable or when a PC's shadow is bound—omens of denied potential, debts of unfulfilled promises.

**The Name-as-Key**

Each floor is locked by a true name tied to the betrayal. Discovering and correctly using it is the cleanest exit. Combat or workarounds are possible but risk harsher downstream costs.

Key Name: "ELARA THORNWRIGHT, FIRST STUDENT"
Why This Name Matters: Restoring her full name acknowledges she was more than the wound she became.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Acrostic: Initial letters of spell components spell her name
• Palimpsest: Her name visible only under the light of the circle's energy
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses to validate her achievements over the master's reputation

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Spell components arranged in her initials
• Actionable Lead: Arcana reveals energy traces leading to her hidden potential
• Aha! Proof: Tinker work uncovers her secret laboratory with superior designs

Extraction Test:
Evidence or Arcana to trace her contributions (on fail, the circle's energy intensifies but reveals her middle name).

Verification & Use:
Speak her name while placing her notes within the circle; mispronunciations crack the circle (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Validate the apprentice's worth (boon: Student's Favor - once: steady Position when learning); Position +1 next floor
Restitution: Return her notes and acknowledge her contributions publicly (Debt 1 - owed to her surviving family)
Renunciation: Break the circle and erase all records (lose time, gain Stain - Unworthy Teacher)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Boons: Student's Favor (once: steady Position when learning)
Burdens: Stain - Unworthy Teacher if you erase records; Ledger - Helped: Elara if you validate her
Shard Kit: Apprentice's notes grant +1d to sincere apologies later
Links: Reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you honored her name
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Elara Thornwright • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The air crackles with stolen power as a chalk-circle splits the workshop in two. On one side, pristine tools await an absent master; on the other, scorch marks and scattered notes speak of a student who was never meant to return.

Exit Beat:
The circle's light dims as Elara's name echoes through the chamber. Her notes flutter into a neat stack, and for a moment, you feel the weight of all the knowledge that was never shared.

---

## 2 — The Broken Vow

**Memory in One Line:** He abandoned his wedding mid-ritual for discovery.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • frost • ceremony • whispers
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [6] — Shards of cold fall; vows unravel; guests awaken hostile.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich’s Perspective:
He believed a perfect theorem could spare future grief, and so he traded the present for the promise. She stood alone with a vow in her mouth and a ring gone cold. The aisle's frost is the breath of every apology he never learned to make.

From the Harmed Party’s Perspective:
She had waited years for this day, weaving her hopes into every stitch of her dress. When he vanished mid-ceremony, she was left holding a broken promise and a ring that would never warm. Justice would have been completion—his presence, his commitment, his choice to honor what he had sworn.

Penance Sought:
To witness a vow completed without him—and bless it.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: A chapel of ice, pews under hoarfrost; a choir that sings syllables backward; a ring on a pedestal sweating cold.
Anchors: Frost-covered altar, wedding ring, inverted vows, backward-singing choir
Senses: The scent of winter roses; the sound of vows being unsaid; cold that seeps into bone
Adversaries/Agents: Memory-echo bride, frost wights, inverted wedding guests

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Presence → Ask consent to continue the rite (DV 2)
• Rites → Bind a surrogate witnessing (DV 3)
• Wits → Trace the escape sigil (DV 2)
• Duel → Hold off jealous guardians (DV 3)

Position Drift:
Mercy (honoring the vow) raises Position next floor; rejection (breaking the ritual) drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
The chapel fractures into cold shards; guests awaken hostile, demanding completion of what was started.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Petals turn to cutting glass.
• 2 SB: Choir turns accusatory.
• 3 SB: The ring binds a PC to a test of fidelity.
• 4+ SB: A spectral groom arrives to claim his bride.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the ring binds a PC or when guests turn hostile—omens of broken promises, debts of unfulfilled commitments.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "ALYSSA WHITE-LILY"
Why This Name Matters: Restoring her full name acknowledges she was more than the wound she became.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Acrostic: Initial letters of guest ledgers spell her name
• Backmask: Spoken backward by echo-choir; correct with counter-chant
• Taboo Hearing: Name audible only after an apology / act of restitution

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Lilies carved on the aisle
• Actionable Lead: Choir sings a phrase that becomes legible when the ring warms
• Aha! Proof: Steam reveals the palimpsest on the lectern

Extraction Test:
Evidence or Arcana to restore the lectern's palimpsest (on fail, the frost spreads but reveals her middle name).

Verification & Use:
Speak her name while placing the ring on the pedestal's warmer; mispronunciations crack the ring (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Bless a new vow (boon: Blessing vs undead); Position +1
Restitution: Donate a treasured item to her family row (Debt 1)
Renunciation: Break the escape sigil and stay through the ritual (lose time, gain Public Grace later)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Boons: Bride's Favor (once: steady Position)
Burdens: Cold Curse if you reject; Ledger - Helped: Alyssa
Shard Kit: Frosted ring grants +1d to sincere apologies later
Links: Reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you honored her name
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Alyssa White-Lily • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
Frost-laced petals hang in the air, refusing to fall. The choir inhales a vow backward.

Exit Beat:
The frost melts into dew; lilies breathe; the aisle warms under your steps.

---

## 3 — The Fallen Comrade

**Memory in One Line:** He fled, leaving a shield-mate to die.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • sand • battle • guilt
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [5] — Banners tighten into nooses; sand shifts to quicksand; campaign clock ticks.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich’s Perspective:
The battle was lost—their position compromised, surrounded by enemies who showed no mercy. He told himself it was tactical retreat, strategic withdrawal, but deep down he knew the truth: fear had driven him to abandon his comrade. The sand still holds the weight of that choice, and the banners remember every fallen ally he left behind.

From the Harmed Party’s Perspective:
They had fought side by side for years, sharing rations, covering each other's backs, trusting with their lives. When the moment of greatest need came, their shield-brother vanished, leaving them to face certain death alone. Justice would have been standing together—or dying together.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge the debt owed to his fallen comrade and carry their memory forward.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Sand-choked battlefield; banners as nooses; scattered weapons and armor half-buried.
Anchors: Fallen comrade's shield, campaign standard, scattered weapons, memorial cairn
Senses: The taste of dust and blood; the sound of distant battle cries; shifting sand that threatens to bury everything
Adversaries/Agents: Sand wights, memory-bandits, spectral echoes of fallen soldiers

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Command → Rally ghost cohort (DV 3)
• Medicine → Salvage the dying echo (DV 2)
• Skirmish → Cut through memory-bandits (DV 2)
• Move → Dodge sand-wights (DV 3)

Position Drift:
Staying to hold the line raises Position next floor; abandoning the post drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
The battlefield transforms into quicksand; banners tighten into nooses; the old campaign clock begins ticking again.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Confusion fog rolls in.
• 2 SB: Old campaign clock ticks—reinforcements arrive.
• 3 SB: A dying echo whispers the location of hidden supplies.
• 4+ SB: The fallen comrade's spirit rises, demanding explanation.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the battlefield becomes quicksand or when the fallen comrade's spirit rises—omens of battlefield guilt, debts of unfulfilled duty.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THANE IRONHEART"
Why This Name Matters: Honoring his name acknowledges the sacrifice he made and the debt that remains unpaid.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Syllable Scavenger: Fragments of his name found on scattered weapons and armor
• Palimpsest: His name visible only when blood is spilled on his shield

## 4 — The Rejected Love

**Memory in One Line:** He spurned mortal affection to pursue immortality.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • night • garden • heartbreak
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [4] — Flowers close; heart slows; silver lilies wilt.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich’s Perspective:
Love was a distraction, he told himself—a weakness that would prevent him from achieving true greatness. The mortal woman who loved him was beautiful, kind, and patient, but he could not see past his own ambitions. When she offered her heart, he chose his research instead, never realizing that in rejecting her, he had already lost the very thing he sought to preserve.

From the Harmed Party’s Perspective:
She had given everything—her heart, her future, her dreams of a simple life together. In return, she received nothing but cold words and a slammed door. Justice would have been recognition—acknowledgment that love deserved more than scraps from his ambition's table.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge the love he rejected and the pain he caused.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Night garden of silver lilies; a heart in a glass cloche beats slowly; moonlight filters through twisted branches.
Anchors: Glass cloche with beating heart, silver lilies, love letters, memory-tree
Senses: The scent of night-blooming flowers; the sound of a slowing heartbeat; moonlight that seems to watch
Adversaries/Agents: Wilted lilies that attack, memory echoes of romantic moments, guardian of the heart

**Handles & Difficulty**

• Sway → Sincere apology (DV 2)
• Theft → Return a token (DV 3)
• Arcana → Unbind cloche (DV 3)
• Performance → Dance the pledge back (DV 2)

Flowers close; heart slows; silver lilies wilt and turn to thorns.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Flowers whisper your worst doubt.
• 2 SB: The cloche draws breath from the room.
• 3 SB: A hidden cache of love letters reveals the depth of feeling rejected.
• 4+ SB: The guardian of the heart awakens, demanding satisfaction.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the heart's beat slows or when the guardian awakens—omens of rejected love, debts of emotional harm.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "LYRA NIGHTINGALE"
Why This Name Matters: Restoring her full name acknowledges she was more than the wound she became.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Palimpsest: Her name visible only when tears fall on the cloche
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses compassion over ambition
• Syllable Scavenger: Fragments of her name found in love letters

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Silver lilies arranged in her initials
• Actionable Lead: Theft reveals a hidden locket with her portrait
• Aha! Proof: Sway work uncovers her true feelings in her own words

Extraction Test:
Sway or Theft to recover her token (on fail, the heart's beat weakens but reveals her middle name).

Speak her name while returning her token to the cloche; mispronunciations cause the lilies to wither (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Return the token (gain Favor; +1d once later)

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
Silver lilies bloom in impossible moonlight, their petals shimmering like stars. In a glass cloche at the garden's heart, something beats with slow, sad rhythm.

Exit Beat:
The lilies' glow softens as Lyra's name is spoken. The heart's beat steadies, and for a moment, you feel the warmth of love that was once offered.

## 5 — The Betrayed Mentor

**Memory in One Line:** He stole forbidden pages.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • study • theft • hypocrisy
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [5] — Footnotes recite accusations; cane taps faster; secret pages flare.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich’s Perspective:
Knowledge was power, and power was the only thing that mattered. His mentor had hoarded forbidden texts, keeping them from those who might use them for good. He told himself he was liberating wisdom, making it available to those who deserved it. But the truth was simpler: he coveted what his teacher possessed and was willing to betray trust to obtain it.

From the Harmed Party’s Perspective:
The forbidden pages were not his to give—he had sworn oaths to protect them, to use them only under strict conditions. When his student stole them, he felt not just the loss of precious knowledge but the deeper wound of betrayal by one he had trusted implicitly. Justice would have been acknowledgment of the theft and restoration of what was taken.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his betrayal and make amends for stealing his mentor's trust.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Spiral study; every step recites footnotes; the mentor's cane taps from above; forbidden texts line the walls.
Anchors: Mentor's cane, forbidden pages, study ledger, accusation scrolls
Senses: The sound of whispered footnotes; the tap-tap of the cane growing closer; the musty scent of ancient parchment
Adversaries/Agents: Marginalia-imps, secret page guardians, mentor's echo

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Deception → Stage a confession (DV 3)
• Tinker → Swap facsimile pages (DV 2)
• Arcana → Trace original ink (DV 3)
• Skirmish → Duel the cane (DV 2)

Position Drift:
Returning pages raises Position next floor; keeping knowledge drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Footnotes recite accusations louder; cane taps faster; secret pages flare with dangerous energy.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: A marginalia-imp bites at evidence.
• 2 SB: Accusation scrolls multiply, creating confusion.
• 3 SB: A secret page flares, blinding.
• 4+ SB: The mentor's echo arrives to confront the thief.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the secret page flares or when the mentor's echo arrives—omens of academic betrayal, debts of stolen wisdom.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "MASTER RHEM, KEEPER OF FORBIDDEN LORE"
Why This Name Matters: Acknowledging his full title recognizes the respect and trust that was betrayed.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):

• Palimpsest: His name visible only under the light of forbidden knowledge
• Ledger Lock: Must be written with a specific quill on a named page

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Book spines arranged in his initials
• Actionable Lead: Arcana reveals energy traces leading to his hidden study

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The spiral study whispers with the voices of a thousand footnotes, each one an accusation. Above, the tap-tap of a cane grows steadily closer.

Exit Beat:
The footnotes fall silent as Master Rhem's name is spoken. The forbidden pages settle into their proper places, and the study finds peace.

## 6 — The Children of the Plague-House

**Memory in One Line:** He quarantined too harshly, dooming survivors.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • infirmary • plague • mercy
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [6] — Lullaby grows discordant; vents cough worse fumes; time loss imminent.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
Containment was paramount—any breach could mean the spread of pestilence beyond the house's walls. He had seen what unchecked disease could do, how it could ravage entire communities. The harsh quarantine was necessary, he told himself, even if it meant some would perish who might otherwise have lived. But in his zeal for protection, he had forgotten that mercy was also a form of wisdom.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They were not the disease—they were children who had lost their families to it, who had found some measure of safety within the house's walls. When the quarantine was sealed too tightly, when no one came to tend their needs, they faced a slower death from neglect. Justice would have been care—someone to feed them, comfort them, give them a chance.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge the mercy he failed to show and the lives lost to his harsh judgment.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Boarded infirmary, lullaby through vents, medical supplies scattered and decaying.
Anchors: Quarantine ledger, medical supplies, children's drawings, lullaby box
Senses: The scent of old medicine and decay; the sound of a discordant lullaby; the feel of cold, sterile air
Adversaries/Agents: Coughing echoes, plague spirits, time-loss phantoms

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Medicine → Triage echoes (DV 2)
• Insight → Weigh utilitarian cost (DV 3)
• Rites → Quiet passing (DV 2)
• Move → Thread contagion wards (DV 3)

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Lullaby grows discordant; vents cough worse fumes; time loss becomes imminent.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Cough spreads to a PC (Fatigue)
• 2 SB: Medical supplies prove inadequate.
• 3 SB: A screaming vent opens—time loss.
• 4+ SB: The spirits of the children demand justice.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the cough spreads or when the children's spirits rise—omens of medical failure, debts of unfulfilled care.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THE CHILDREN OF THE WHITE ROSE INFIRMARY"
Why This Name Matters: They were more than victims—they were individuals who deserved better.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Syllable Scavenger: Fragments of their collective name found in children's drawings
• Palimpsest: Their name visible only when tears fall on the lullaby box
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses care over containment

Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Children of the White Rose Infirmary • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The infirmary reeks of old medicine and something worse. Through the vents comes a lullaby, discordant and wrong, while shadows move behind boarded windows.

Exit Beat:
The lullaby softens into a proper tune as the children's names are spoken. Their echoes fade with smiles, and the infirmary finds peace.

## 7 — The Crown Informant

**Memory in One Line:** He traded a friend to the authorities.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • tea-house • masks • betrayal
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [4] — Masks tilt accusingly; whispers grow louder; sealed writ lands.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The choice seemed clear at the time—protect himself and his research by eliminating a threat. His friend had stumbled upon dangerous knowledge, knowledge that could destroy everything he had built. He told himself it was necessary, that the greater good required sacrifice. But in the end, it was fear that drove him to betray the trust of one who had stood by him through everything.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had been friends for years, sharing secrets, dreams, and dangers. When the authorities came, they never expected their friend to be the one to open the door. Justice would have been loyalty—standing together against the storm, finding another way, anything but betrayal.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge the betrayal and the trust that was broken.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Tea-house murmurs; lacquered masks tilt toward you; shadows dance between tables.
Anchors: Lacquered masks, friendship tokens, sealed writ, tea service

• Sway → Reframe as lesser betrayal (DV 2)

Masks tilt accusingly; whispers grow louder; sealed writ lands with finality.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Friend-echo recognizes you.
• 2 SB: Tea-house patrons turn hostile.
• 3 SB: A sealed writ lands—law binds choices.
• 4+ SB: The friend's spirit arrives to confront the betrayer.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the friend's echo recognizes you or when the sealed writ lands—omens of betrayed trust, debts of broken friendship.

Exit Beat:
The masks settle as Kira's name is spoken. Her friendship token warms briefly before going cold, and the tea-house finds peace.

## 8 — The Oath of the Doorwarden

**Memory in One Line:** He failed a sacred watch.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • temple • door • vigil
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [5] — Hinge screams; pilgrim-echo pushes through; breach-creature stirs.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The sacred trust placed in him was immense—a door that kept the darkness at bay, that protected the innocent who sought sanctuary. But he had grown weary, complacent in his duty. When the moment of greatest need came, he faltered, his attention wandering just long enough for the breach to occur. The consequences were catastrophic, and he knew that no amount of penance could truly make amends.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had come seeking sanctuary, trusting in the ancient oaths that protected this place. When the door failed, when the guardian fell asleep at his post, they were left to face horrors beyond imagination. Justice would have been vigilance—unwavering attention to duty, no matter how long or boring the watch.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his failure and stand a proper watch.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Temple gate, seven locks, one missing tooth; ancient wards flicker and fade.
Anchors: Temple gate, seven locks, missing tooth, guardian's helm, sacred oil
Senses: The scent of old incense and neglect; the sound of a screaming hinge; the feel of darkness pressing at the edges

The hinge screams; pilgrim-echo pushes through; breach-creature stirs from its slumber.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: The hinge screams with increasing intensity.
• 2 SB: Sacred oil runs low.
• 3 SB: A pilgrim-echo tries to push through.
• 4+ SB: The breach-creature fully awakens.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the breach-creature stirs or when pilgrim-echoes push through—omens of failed duty, debts of broken oaths.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THE OATH CALLED THRESHOLD"
Why This Name Matters: The oath itself was the true guardian, and by failing it, he failed everything it protected.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Acrostic: Initial letters of the seven locks spell the oath
• Palimpsest: The oath visible only when sacred oil is applied to the missing tooth
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses duty over convenience

The temple gate stands before you, its seven locks gleaming with ancient power. But one tooth is missing from its great mouth, and through the gap, you can feel something dark stirring.

Exit Beat:
The gate's locks click into place as the oath is spoken. The missing tooth settles into position, and the temple finds peace.

## 9 — The Scholar's Duel

**Memory in One Line:** He discredited a rival through lies.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • lecture-hall • chalk • falsehood
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [4] — Bell tolls on falsehoods; note-mites chew proofs; reputation crumbles.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
Academic reputation was everything—without it, his research would be dismissed, his theories ignored. When his rival presented compelling evidence that threatened to overshadow his own work, he knew he had to act. The lies came easily, spun from half-truths and careful omissions. He told himself it was a necessary evil, that the greater good of his research justified the deception. But in the end, he had only proven that he was unworthy of the very reputation he sought to protect.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
Years of research, countless hours of careful study, all destroyed by a rival's malicious lies. The academic community turned their back, their funding was cut, and their career was left in ruins. Justice would have been truth—the chance to present their evidence fairly, to let the merit of their work speak for itself.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his lies and restore his rival's reputation.

**Environment & Manifestations**

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Note-mites chew proofs.

## 10 — The Siege of Hearth-Row

**Memory in One Line:** He sold a neighborhood to fund research.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • siege • hearth • betrayal
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [6] — Roof collapse; hostage ledger appears; house-gods glare.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The research required resources—rare components, specialized equipment, assistants who understood the work. When his funds ran low, he saw an opportunity in the struggling neighborhood of Hearth-Row. The residents were desperate, willing to accept any offer that promised stability. He told himself he was helping them, giving them a better future, but the truth was that he was using their desperation to fund his own ambitions.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had lived in Hearth-Row for generations, building lives, families, and memories within its narrow lanes. When the researcher came with his offers, they thought they were securing a better future. Instead, they found themselves displaced, their homes sold out from under them to fund experiments they never agreed to. Justice would have been choice—the right to decide their own fate, not have it sold behind their backs.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his betrayal and the homes he destroyed.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Narrow lanes; house-gods glare from soot-stained walls; eviction notices flutter in the wind.
Anchors: House-gods, eviction notices, hostage ledger, neighborhood map

## 11 — The Pact of the Dry Well

**Memory in One Line:** He broke a village's water-pact.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • drought • well • thirst
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [5] — Cracks spread underfoot; thirst-curse licks lips; spirit sighs below.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The village's water-pact was simple—regular offerings in exchange for a steady flow from the ancient well. But his research required rare components that grew only in the deepest caverns, beneath the village's sacred spring. He told himself the disruption would be temporary, that he could restore the flow once his work was complete. But the well's guardian was ancient and unforgiving, and the pact, once broken, could not be easily mended.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
The well had provided for generations, its waters sustaining crops, livestock, and families through countless seasons. When it suddenly ran dry, when the promised flow became a trickle and then nothing, the village faced starvation and despair. Justice would have been respect—honoring the ancient agreement, finding another way rather than breaking a sacred trust.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his broken promise and restore the village's water-source.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Salt rings mark where water once flowed; hung jars remain empty; something sighs from the dry well.
Anchors: Dry well, salt rings, offering jars, water-pact scroll, spirit's shrine
Senses: The taste of dust and salt; the sound of distant sighing; the feel of creeping thirst
Adversaries/Agents: Thirst-curse spirits, cracked earth elementals, village elders' echoes

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Rites → Appease spirit (DV 2)
• Survival → Re-route flow (DV 3)
• Tinker → Raise bucket engine (DV 3)
• Sway → Mediate terms (DV 2)

Position Drift:
Patching the pact raises Position next floor; taking the depths drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Cracks spread underfoot; thirst-curse licks your lips; the spirit's sigh grows into a roar.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Cracks spread underfoot, threatening stability.
• 2 SB: A hidden spring is discovered but guarded.
• 3 SB: A thirst-curse licks your lips, draining moisture.
• 4+ SB: The well-spirit fully manifests, demanding restitution.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the thirst-curse manifests or when the well-spirit appears—omens of broken promises, debts of environmental harm.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "NIMUE, GUARDIAN OF THE SACRED WELL"
Why This Name Matters: The spirit had a name and identity beyond being merely a resource to be exploited.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Palimpsest: Her name visible only when water is poured on ancient shrine
• Syllable Scavenger: Fragments of her name found in village folklore
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses restoration over exploitation

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Village folklore mentions "Nimue's tears"
• Actionable Lead: Rites reveal her true name in ritual texts
• Aha! Proof: Survival work uncovers her shrine with the full name

Extraction Test:
Rites or Survival to appease her properly (on fail, the thirst worsens but reveals her title).

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Patch the Pact (gain Token: Water-right)
Restitution: Take the Depths (immediate aid; mark Obligation-style Condition)
Renunciation: Walk Away (Desperate start next floor)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
Salt rings mark where water once flowed freely, and empty jars hang like accusations from wooden beams. From the depths of the dry well comes a sigh that speaks of ancient disappointment.

Exit Beat:
The salt rings glisten as Nimue's name is spoken. Water begins to seep from the well's mouth, and the air grows moist with promise.

## 12 — The Unburied

**Memory in One Line:** He let enemies lie unburied to study them.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • bones • windmill • flies
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [4] — Bone-sail cleaves cover; skull remembers childhood; flies grow louder.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The dead held secrets—knowledge of anatomy, of the moment of death, of what lay beyond. He told himself his studies were for the greater good, that understanding death could lead to better preservation of life. But the truth was simpler: curiosity had overwhelmed respect, and he had left bodies to rot in the open, their bones picked clean by scavengers while he took notes and made observations.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
Death should bring peace, a final rest honored by proper burial. When their fallen were left to the elements, to be picked apart by carrion birds and stripped bare by wind and weather, it was a final indignity added to loss. Justice would have been dignity—respectful treatment of the dead, acknowledgment that even enemies deserved the peace of proper interment.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his disrespect and give the dead their proper rest.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Windmill of bones; chorused flies say your name; scattered skeletons tell stories of violence.
Anchors: Bone windmill, skeletal remains, burial shrouds, death records, flies' chorus
Senses: The smell of decay and old death; the sound of bone rattling in the wind; the feel of being watched by the dead
Adversaries/Agents: Bonewights, corpse-flies, angry spirits, memory-skulls

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Rites → Burial (DV 2)
• Arcana → Sever tethers (DV 3)
• Skirmish → Put down bonewights (DV 2)
• Endure → Carry the weight (DV 3)

Position Drift:
Proper burial raises Position next floor; cataloguing drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Bone-sail cleaves cover; skull remembers your childhood; flies grow into a maddening chorus.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Bone-sail cleaves cover, revealing more remains.
• 2 SB: A bone-sail cleaves through defenses.
• 3 SB: A skull remembers your childhood, speaking forbidden truths.
• 4+ SB: The flies coalesce into a massive, angry swarm.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the bone-sail cuts through or when the flies swarm—omens of desecrated rest, debts of violated peace.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THE UNNAMED DEAD OF THE BATTLE OF BLACKWATER FORD"
Why This Name Matters: Even enemies deserved recognition in death, not to be forgotten as mere specimens.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Syllable Scavenger: Fragments of their collective identity found on dog tags and personal effects
• Palimpsest: Their names visible only when proper burial rites begin
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses respect over knowledge

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Dog tags spell out unit designations
• Actionable Lead: Rites reveal individual identities in death records
• Aha! Proof: Arcana work uncovers their full story in battlefield reports

Extraction Test:
Rites or Arcana to identify them properly (on fail, more remains are disturbed but reveal unit names).

Verification & Use:
Speak their collective name while performing burial rites; mispronunciations cause the bonewights to turn hostile (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Bury (Blessing vs Death magic)
Restitution: Catalogue (+1 effect vs undead later; gain Stain)
Renunciation: Confession (reduce next DV by 1 once)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Boons: Peaceful Rest Blessing (once: +1d vs death magic)
Burdens: Stain if you catalogue; Ledger - Helped: Dead if you bury them
Shard Kit: Burial shroud grants +1d to recognize desecration later

Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Unnamed dead of Blackwater Ford • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The windmill's sails are woven from bleached bones that click and clatter in the breeze. Flies buzz in a constant chorus, and scattered skeletons tell the story of a battle long past.

Exit Beat:
The bone-windmill slows as the dead are named. The flies settle into respectful silence, and for a moment, the battlefield finds peace.

## 13 — The Rival's Heart

**Memory in One Line:** He stole a rival's lover through glamour.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • ballroom • mirrors • glamour
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [5] — Floor becomes slick with spilled secrets; mirror eats dice; reflections turn hostile.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
Professional rivalry was one thing, but when his competitor found love and happiness, something primal stirred within him. He told himself he was simply demonstrating his superior magical prowess, that seducing away another's beloved was merely a test of skill. But the truth was uglier—he had been driven by jealousy, by the need to prove that he could take anything he desired, even another man's heart.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
Love was hard-won, built on trust, shared dreams, and countless small moments of connection. When it was stolen away by trickery and illusion, when the beloved was convinced to leave through magical manipulation, it felt like a theft of the soul. Justice would have been choice—the right to love freely, without enchantment's interference.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his manipulation and restore his rival's chance at happiness.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Ballroom of mirrors; your reflections accuse; crystal chandeliers hang like frozen tears.
Anchors: Mirrors, glamour focus, love letters, rival's portrait, heart pendant
Senses: The scent of roses and regret; the sound of whispered accusations from reflections; the feel of being watched by multiple selves
Adversaries/Agents: Mirror-doppels, glamour spirits, jealous echoes, heart's guardian

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Performance → Dance the truth (DV 2)
• Sway → Public apology (DV 3)
• Arcana → Break glamour (DV 3)
• Skirmish → Mirror-doppel fights (DV 2)

Position Drift:
Undoing glamour raises Position next floor; keeping the lie drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Floor becomes slick with spilled secrets; mirror eats a die from a pool; reflections turn hostile.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Floor becomes slick with spilled secrets.
• 2 SB: A mirror reflection speaks forbidden truths.
• 3 SB: Mirror eats a die from a pool.
• 4+ SB: All reflections turn hostile, attacking with intimate knowledge.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when secrets spill or reflections turn hostile—omens of broken hearts, debts of emotional manipulation.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "VALERIAN DUSKHEART, STOLEN LOVE"
Why This Name Matters: Restoring his full identity acknowledges he was more than a trophy to be won.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Backmask: Name spoken backward by mirror-choir; correct with counter-chant
• Palimpsest: His name visible only when true tears fall on his portrait
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses honesty over victory

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Portrait initials spell his name
• Actionable Lead: Sway reveals his true feelings in hidden correspondence
• Aha! Proof: Arcana work breaks the glamour to show his authentic self

Extraction Test:
Sway or Arcana to see through the glamour (on fail, the illusion strengthens but reveals his middle name).

Verification & Use:
Speak his name while breaking the glamour focus; mispronunciations cause mirrors to shatter (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Undo Glamour (Position +1)
Restitution: Keep the Lie (gain Favor now; lose a friend-later)
Renunciation: Break the Mirrors (Spade omen: shard sticks in soul)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Burdens: Spade omen if you break mirrors; Ledger - Helped: Valerian if you undo glamour
Shard Kit: Heart pendant grants +1d to recognize true love later
Links: Reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you honored his name
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Valerian Duskheart • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The ballroom's mirrors reflect not just your image, but accusations from every angle. Crystal chandeliers hang like frozen tears, and the air shimmers with the residue of broken enchantments.

Exit Beat:
The mirrors clear as Valerian's name is spoken. His reflection smiles sadly before fading, and the ballroom finds peace.

## 14 — The Broken Oath to the Dead

**Memory in One Line:** He promised to guard a grave.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • hill • standing stones • broken promise
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [4] — Cold wind steals breath; name tries to climb into mouth; stones hum with power.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The promise had seemed simple—a favor for an old mentor, to watch over a grave where important research was buried. But as years passed and other opportunities arose, the vigil became inconvenient. He told himself the work was more important, that his research could benefit many more than honoring a single grave. But the truth was that convenience had trumped duty, and a sacred trust had been broken for personal gain.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
The grave held more than just bones—it contained the culmination of a lifetime's work, knowledge that could benefit generations if properly protected and studied. When the guardian abandoned his post, when the sacred site was left vulnerable to grave-robbers and vandals, it felt like a betrayal of everything the deceased had worked for. Justice would have been honor—keeping the watch, protecting what had been entrusted.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his broken vigil and restore proper guardianship.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Hill with standing stones; an honored name is scratched out; disturbed earth shows signs of violation.
Anchors: Standing stones, scratched name, disturbed grave, guardian's oath, protective wards
Senses: The cold wind that steals breath; the hum of standing stones with lost power; the feel of violated sanctity
Adversaries/Agents: Grave-robbers, ward spirits, the deceased's echo, stone guardians

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Survival → Restore cairn (DV 3)
• Rites → Oath-binding (DV 2)
• Skirmish → Grave-robbers (DV 2)
• Insight → Why he failed (DV 3)

Position Drift:
Restoring the name raises Position next floor; sealing it away drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Cold wind steals breath; name tries to climb into a PC's mouth; standing stones begin to crack.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Cold wind steals breath, causing Fatigue.
• 2 SB: Ward spirits grow agitated and hostile.
• 3 SB: A name tries to climb into a PC's mouth, demanding to be spoken.
• 4+ SB: The deceased's echo rises, demanding explanation.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the name tries to speak or when the deceased's echo rises—omens of broken vows, debts of violated trust.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "MASTER ALDRIC THORNFIELD, GUARDIAN'S CHARGE"
Why This Name Matters: Restoring his full title acknowledges the respect and responsibility that was owed.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Acrostic: Initial letters of stone carvings spell his name
• Palimpsest: His name visible only when proper offerings are made
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses duty over convenience

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Stone carvings arranged in his initials
• Actionable Lead: Rites reveal his full title in burial records
• Aha! Proof: Insight uncovers his true story in mentor's journals

Extraction Test:
Rites or Insight to restore his honor (on fail, the grave becomes more disturbed but reveals his middle name).

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Restore Name (gain Ancestor's Watch boon)
Restitution: Seal It Away (safer path opens; lose that boon)
Renunciation: Let the Dead Speak (learn truth; draw Deck now)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Boons: Ancestor's Watch (once: +1d to guardian duties)
Burdens: Loss of boon if you seal it away; Ledger - Helped: Master Aldric if you restore name
Shard Kit: Guardian's oath fragment grants +1d to recognize duty later
Links: Reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you honored his name
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Master Aldric Thornfield • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The hill rises before you, crowned with standing stones that hum with residual power. But one name has been scratched out from the central stone, and the earth around the grave shows signs of recent disturbance.

Exit Beat:
The standing stones ring clearly as Master Aldric's name is spoken. The scratched-out letters fill in with golden light, and the hill finds peace.

## 15 — The Research Fire

**Memory in One Line:** He set a fire to hide evidence.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • stacks • blaze • soot
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [6] — Roof beam falls; "saved" book is false; soot-spirits chant accusations.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The research had gone wrong—terribly, catastrophically wrong. Experiments had produced results he couldn't control, knowledge he couldn't contain. When authorities began asking questions, when colleagues started looking too closely at his work, he panicked. The fire seemed like a clean solution—destroy everything, start over with a new identity. But some secrets couldn't be burned away, and the truth had a way of rising from the ashes.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
The library contained irreplaceable knowledge—centuries of accumulated wisdom, unique texts that existed nowhere else in the world. When it burned, when precious manuscripts turned to ash and knowledge was lost forever, it felt like a crime against humanity itself. Justice would have been accountability—facing the consequences, finding a way to make amends rather than destroying everything.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his attempt to erase the past and face the truth of his actions.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Stacks blaze with magical fire; soot-spirits chant; precious books turn to ash while others reveal hidden truths.
Anchors: Burning stacks, soot-spirits, fire focus, hidden safe-room, ash-covered texts
Senses: The smell of burning parchment and magic; the sound of soot-spirits chanting; the heat of destructive flames
Adversaries/Agents: Ash wraiths, fire elementals, soot-spirits, truth-seeking guardians

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Move → Create firebreak (DV 3)
• Tinker → Sprinkler glyphs (DV 2)
• Skirmish → Ash wraiths (DV 2)
• Insight → Find the real truth he buried (DV 3)

Position Drift:
Saving lives raises Position next floor; saving proof drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Roof beam falls; "saved" book is false; soot-spirits chant the names of all he tried to destroy.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Magical flames spread unpredictably.
• 2 SB: Roof beam falls, blocking an exit.
• 3 SB: A "saved" book is revealed to be false.
• 4+ SB: Soot-spirits chant the full list of destroyed knowledge.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when beams fall or when soot-spirits chant—omens of hidden truths, debts of destroyed knowledge.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THE TRUTH OF THE NECROMANTIC EXPERIMENTS, BURIED IN ASHES"
Why This Name Matters: The truth itself deserved to be named and acknowledged, not destroyed.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Palimpsest: Truth visible only when water is poured on ash-covered texts
• Syllable Scavenger: Fragments of the truth found in partially burned documents
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses honesty over self-preservation

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Partially burned text spells "truth" in ash
• Actionable Lead: Insight reveals the scope of destroyed research
• Aha! Proof: Tinker work uncovers the hidden safe-room with complete records

Extraction Test:
Insight or Tinker to recover the truth (on fail, more knowledge is lost but reveals research topics).

Verification & Use:
Speak the truth's name while preserving what remains; mispronunciations cause the fire to spread (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Save Lives (Blessing)
Restitution: Save Proof (unlock clue elsewhere; mark Guilt)
Renunciation: Let it Burn (Position -1; but gain Power cipher later)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Boons: Preservation Blessing (once: +1d to save valuable items)
Burdens: Guilt marker if you save proof; Ledger - Helped: Knowledge if you save lives
Shard Kit: Ash-covered text grants +1d to recognize hidden truths later
Links: Reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you preserved knowledge
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Lost knowledge of the great library • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
Flames dance between the book stacks, fed by more than mere wood and paper. Soot-spirits chant in voices like rustling pages, and the air crackles with the destruction of irreplaceable knowledge.

Exit Beat:
The flames dim as the truth's name is spoken. Ash settles into peaceful patterns, and among the ruins, new growth begins to emerge.

## 16 — The Orphan's Blade

**Memory in One Line:** He trained a child assassin.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • rooftop • bell-lanterns • corruption
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [5] — Knife flashes at throat; kill-phrase echoes; bell-lanterns swing wildly.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The child was a blank slate, easily molded, desperate for purpose and belonging. He told himself he was offering salvation—a chance to matter, to be more than a street urchin scraping for survival. But the truth was darker: he needed a tool, someone he could control completely, whose loyalty was absolute. In creating the perfect assassin, he had destroyed a child's chance at innocence and humanity.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
Before the training, there had been dreams—simple, childish hopes of growing up to be a hero or a scholar or anything but what they became. When those dreams were systematically stripped away, when violence was taught as love and obedience as virtue, something fundamental was lost. Justice would have been childhood—the right to grow up whole, to choose one's own path without manipulation.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his corruption of innocence and break the chains of control he imposed.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Rooftop training ground; bell-lanterns swing in the wind; practice dummies bear the scars of countless lessons.
Anchors: Training dummies, bell-lanterns, kill-phrase focus, childhood mementos, assassin's blade
Senses: The clang of practice weapons; the whisper of wind through lanterns; the metallic taste of fear
Adversaries/Agents:** Orphan assassins, bell-lantern spirits, kill-phrase echoes, childhood memories made manifest

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Sway → Deprogram (DV 3)
• Skirmish → Disarm gently (DV 2)
• Acrobatics → Catch the fall (DV 3)
• Arcana → Unbind kill-phrase (DV 2)

Position Drift:
Breaking the phrase raises Position next floor; finishing the lesson drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Knife flashes at a throat; kill-phrase echoes in the bells; bell-lanterns swing wildly, blinding with their light.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: A practice dummy animates, attacking with mechanical precision.
• 2 SB: Knife flashes at a throat, demanding a choice.
• 3 SB: Kill-phrase echoes in the bells, compelling obedience.
• 4+ SB: The child's spirit appears, demanding release from their conditioning.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the kill-phrase activates or when the child's spirit appears—omens of corrupted innocence, debts of stolen childhood.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THE NAMELESS ONE, CHILD OF SHADOW"
Why This Name Matters: Restoring their identity acknowledges they were more than just a weapon.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Syllable Scavenger: Fragments of their true name found in childhood mementos
• Palimpsest: Their name visible only when tears fall on the assassin's blade
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses compassion over control

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Childhood drawings spell out "Hope"
• Actionable Lead: Sway reveals their true feelings in hidden letters
• Aha! Proof: Arcana work breaks the conditioning to show their authentic self

Extraction Test:
Sway or Arcana to see through the conditioning (on fail, the conditioning strengthens but reveals their original name).

Verification & Use:
Speak their true name while breaking the kill-phrase focus; mispronunciations cause the bell-lanterns to attack (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Break the Phrase (gain Guarded Word talisman)
Restitution: Finish the Lesson (gain deadly ally; mark Stain)
Renunciation: Adopt Responsibility (downtime obligation reduces future DV once)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Boons: Guarded Word Talisman (once: immune to compulsion phrases)
Burdens: Stain if you finish the lesson; Ledger - Helped: Nameless One if you break the phrase
Shard Kit: Childhood memento grants +1d to recognize manipulation later
Links: Reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you honored their name
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Nameless One • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The rooftop training ground stretches before you, marked by countless scars where blade met blade. Bell-lanterns swing in the wind, casting dancing shadows that seem almost alive with remembered violence.

Exit Beat:
The bell-lanterns still as the child's true name is spoken. Their blade falls harmlessly to the ground, and for a moment, you see a child's smile instead of an assassin's glare.

## 17 — The Siege Engine Test

**Memory in One Line:** He field-tested a weapon on a village.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • ballista field • stones • screams
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [6] — Misfire blasts the party; sponsor-echo offers coin; villagers' ghosts rise.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The weapon was revolutionary—capable of leveling fortifications, ending sieges before they began. He told himself the test was necessary, that the few lives lost were justified by the thousands that would be saved in future conflicts. But the villagers had been real people with real families, not abstract targets or acceptable losses. The screams he had tried to forget still haunted his dreams.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had been going about their daily lives—tending fields, caring for children, preparing meals—when the sky suddenly erupted with destruction. The weapon came without warning, without declaration of war, without any recognition of their humanity. Justice would have been choice—the right to flee, to surrender, to exist without being collateral in someone else's ambitions.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his role in their deaths and take responsibility for the weapon he created.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Abandoned ballista field; stones weep with residual sorrow; broken homes dot the landscape like broken teeth.
Anchors: Siege engine, weeping stones, victim memorials, weapon schematics, sponsor's contract
Senses: The metallic taste of blood and fear; the sound of phantom screams; the feel of destructive power
Adversaries/Agents:** Stone weepers (animated rocks that cry tears of acid), village ghosts, weapon engineers, sponsor's enforcer

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Tinker → Sabotage (DV 3)
• Command → Evacuate echoes (DV 2)
• Skirmish → Fight engineers (DV 3)
• Evidence → Expose sponsor (DV 2)

Position Drift:
Sabotaging the weapon raises Position next floor; taking the coin drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Misfire blasts the party; sponsor-echo offers coin to walk away; villagers' ghosts rise to demand justice.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: A stone weeper's tears cause acid burns.
• 2 SB: Misfire blasts the party, causing collateral damage.
• 3 SB: A sponsor-echo offers coin to walk away from the truth.
• 4+ SB: The villagers' ghosts rise, demanding justice for their deaths.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the weapon misfires or when ghosts rise—omens of destructive ambition, debts of innocent blood.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THE VILLAGE OF THORNWICK, DESTROYED BY PROGRESS"
Why This Name Matters: The village had an identity beyond being a test site.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Acrostic: Initial letters of memorial stones spell the village name
• Palimpsest: Village name visible only when proper respects are paid to memorials
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses accountability over advancement

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Memorial stones arranged in village initials
• Actionable Lead: Evidence reveals the full extent of the atrocity in military reports
• Aha! Proof: Command work uncovers the village's true history from survivor accounts

Extraction Test:
Evidence or Command to expose the full truth (on fail, more victims are forgotten but reveal village details).

Verification & Use:
Speak the village's name while sabotaging the weapon; mispronunciations cause the siege engine to target allies (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Sabotage (lower later harm)
Restitution: Expose (gain Leverage; attract enemies)
Renunciation: Take the Coin (resources now; Position -1 next two floors)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Boons: Weapon Saboteur (once: +1d to disable destructive devices)
Burdens: Position -1 if you take the coin; Ledger - Helped: Thornwick if you sabotage
Shard Kit: Memorial stone fragment grants +1d to recognize war crimes later
Links: Reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you honored their memory
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Village of Thornwick • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The abandoned ballista field stretches before you, its massive weapon pointing toward broken homes and weeping stones. The air hums with the residual power of destruction, and phantom screams echo in the wind.

Exit Beat:
The siege engine falls silent as Thornwick's name is spoken. The weeping stones dry their tears, and the broken village finds peace in memory.

## 18 — The University Vote

**Memory in One Line:** He blocked reparations to a harmed cohort.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • senate • candles • ballots
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [4] — Whip flips votes; clock gains segment; academic censors arrive.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The reparations would have set a dangerous precedent—acknowledging fault, paying for mistakes, opening the floodgates for every disgruntled student or colleague to demand compensation. He told himself he was protecting the institution's integrity, its reputation, its future. But the truth was that pride and fear of financial loss had driven him to silence those who had been genuinely harmed by his colleagues' actions.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had trusted the university to be a place of learning, growth, and safety. When that trust was betrayed, when they were harmed by those sworn to protect them, they sought justice through proper channels. When those channels were blocked by political maneuvering and bureaucratic indifference, it felt like a second betrayal. Justice would have been acknowledgment—recognizing the harm done and taking concrete steps to make amends.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his role in silencing victims and support their quest for justice.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Senate in candle-gloom; ballots bleed wax; academic robes hang like accusations from empty chairs.
Anchors: Voting chamber, bleeding ballots, victim testimonies, university charter, academic robes
Senses: The scent of old wax and fear; the sound of whispered votes; the feel of institutional power
Adversaries/Agents:** Academic censors, voting manipulators, victim echoes, university bureaucrats

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Sway → Coalition-build (DV 3)
• Deception → Parliamentary trick (DV 2)
• Law → Craft binding motion (DV 3)

## 19 — The Expedition

**Memory in One Line:** He misled peers into a lethal dig.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • necropolis • tent • sand
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [6] — Trench collapses; plague-sigil coughs; ancient guardian stirs.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The discovery promised to revolutionize their understanding of ancient magic, to bring fame and fortune to all involved. He had genuinely believed in the site's potential, had been convinced by fragmentary evidence that something extraordinary lay buried beneath the sands. But his certainty had been misplaced, his enthusiasm blinding. The site was a tomb, and the "artifacts" were curses waiting to be unleashed. His colleagues had trusted him, followed him into danger based on his assurances, and paid the ultimate price for his hubris.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had joined the expedition in good faith, drawn by the promise of discovery and the thrill of archaeological adventure. When the warnings were dismissed, when safety protocols were ignored in the rush for glory, they found themselves trapped in a deathtrap of their leader's making. Justice would have been honesty—acknowledging the risks, respecting concerns, prioritizing lives over ambition.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his misleading guidance and honor the memory of those who trusted him.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Wind-scoured necropolis digsite; tent pegs creak with ancient malice; half-excavated tombs yawn like broken mouths.
Anchors: Excavation site, cursed artifacts, safety equipment, expedition logs, memorial markers
Senses: The taste of ancient dust and decay; the sound of shifting sand and creaking wood; the feel of being watched by the dead
Adversaries/Agents:** Sand-ghouls (undead creatures that emerge from disturbed burial sites), plague wights, ancient guardians, cursed artifacts, expedition ghosts

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Survival → Safe path (DV 3)
• Arcana → Read tomb script (DV 2)
• Skirmish → Sand-ghuls (DV 3)
• Tinker → Shore trenches (DV 2)

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Trench collapses; plague-sigil coughs; ancient guardian stirs from its slumber to protect its rest.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: A trench collapses, trapping party members.
• 2 SB: A plague-sigil coughs, spreading disease.
• 3 SB: Ancient guardian stirs, demanding respect for the dead.
• 4+ SB: The expedition's ghosts rise, demanding accountability for their deaths.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the trench collapses or when ghosts rise—omens of archaeological hubris, debts of betrayed trust.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THE EXPEDITION TO THE TOMB OF THE FORGOTTEN PHARAOHS, BETRAYED"
Why This Name Matters: The expedition had a purpose and identity beyond being a source of cursed artifacts.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Acrostic: Initial letters of team member names spell the expedition's true purpose
• Palimpsest: Expedition name visible only when proper funeral rites are performed

## 20 — The Confessor's Lament

**Memory in One Line:** He used a lover's confession in a paper.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • confessional • glass • ink
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [4] — Ink stains hands; echo asks for PC confession; privacy barrier weakens.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The confession had contained insights—raw, emotional truths that could advance psychological understanding, contribute to academic discourse. He told himself he was anonymizing the content, removing identifying details, serving the greater good of knowledge. But the truth was that intimacy had been weaponized, trust betrayed for personal advancement. The lover had shared their soul in confidence, and he had turned it into data points and publishable material.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
The confessional had been sacred space—a place where vulnerabilities could be shared without fear of judgment or exposure. When those private words were used without consent, when intimate moments became public property, it felt like a violation of the soul itself. Justice would have been respect—honoring the boundaries of trust, keeping confidences inviolate.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his breach of confidence and restore the sanctity of private trust.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Confessional of glass; ink drips inside like tears; privacy barriers flicker between transparency and opacity.
Anchors: Glass confessional, dripping ink, published paper, lover's portrait, privacy wards
Senses: The metallic taste of betrayal; the sound of dripping ink like falling tears; the feel of exposed vulnerability
Adversaries/Agents:** Privacy wraiths (spirits that embody violated confidentiality), confession echoes, academic censors, ink elementals

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Presence → Apology (DV 2)
• Evidence → Destroy the paper (DV 3)
• Deception → Convince the echo it was mutual (DV 3)
• Arcana → Blank the confession (DV 2)

Position Drift:
Public apology raises Position next floor; quiet erasure drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Ink stains a PC's hands (Stain); echo asks a PC to confess something true; privacy barrier weakens completely.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Ink stains a PC's hands, marking them with Stain.
• 2 SB: Privacy barrier flickers, exposing private thoughts.
• 3 SB: The echo asks a PC to confess something true, putting them on the spot.
• 4+ SB: Privacy wraiths manifest, demanding justice for violated confidences.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when hands are stained or when privacy wraiths appear—omens of violated trust, debts of exposed intimacy.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "ELARA MORNINGSTAR, VIOLATED IN CONFIDENCE"
Why This Name Matters: Restoring her full identity acknowledges she was more than just a source of data.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Palimpsest: Her name visible only when tears fall on the published paper
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses honesty over academic advancement
• Syllable Scavenger: Fragments of her name found in redacted portions of the paper

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Redacted portions spell her initials when held to light
• Actionable Lead: Presence reveals her true feelings in hidden correspondence
• Aha! Proof: Arcana work uncovers her full identity in the paper's metadata

Extraction Test:
Presence or Arcana to restore her dignity (on fail, more private information is exposed but reveals her middle name).

Verification & Use:
Speak her full name while destroying the paper; mispronunciations cause the ink to attack (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

Mercy: Public Apology (gain Truth's Edge die once)
Restitution: Quiet Erasure (safer now; debt later)
Renunciation: Trade Truths (everyone tells one; Boons +1)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Burdens: Future debt if you erase quietly; Ledger - Helped: Elara if you apologize publicly
Shard Kit: Lover's portrait grants +1d to recognize manipulation later
Links: Reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you honored her name
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Elara Morningstar • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The glass confessional stands before you, its transparent walls offering no privacy. Ink drips inside like tears of shame, and the air hums with the weight of violated confidences.

Exit Beat:
The ink stops dripping as Elara's name is spoken. The glass walls fog over respectfully, and the confessional finds privacy in memory.

## 21 — The Coven Gate

**Memory in One Line:** He stole a ritual and sold it.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • standing stones • fog • betrayal
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [5] — Buyer names an ally; stone groans; threshold tears.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The ritual was magnificent—complex, powerful, the culmination of decades of coven work. He told himself he was preserving knowledge that might otherwise be lost, that selling it to a responsible buyer would ensure its continued study. But the truth was simpler: he coveted what wasn't his, betrayed the trust of those who had shared their secrets, and profited from their collective wisdom like a common thief.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
The ritual was more than a spell—it was their heritage, their identity, the sacred work that bound them together as a community. When it was stolen and sold, when their carefully guarded secrets became commodities in the open market, it felt like a theft of their very souls. Justice would have been respect—honoring their ownership, seeking permission before sharing, understanding that some knowledge comes with strings attached.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his theft and restore what he took from the coven.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Standing stones with borrowed sigils, a buyer waiting in fog; the air crackles with stolen power.
Anchors: Standing stones, borrowed sigils, buyer's contract, coven grimoire, threshold markers
Senses: The taste of stolen magic; the sound of groaning stone; the feel of violated sacred space
Adversaries/Agents:** Sigil thieves, fog wraiths, coven guardians, ritual buyers, threshold demons

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Arcana → Restore rightful words (DV 3)
• Sway → Renegotiate (DV 2)
• Skirmish → Stop the exchange (DV 3)
• Theft → Swap the grimoire (DV 2)

Position Drift:
Returning it raises Position next floor; selling again drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Buyer names an ally among the party; stone groans with violated power; threshold tears open to darker realms.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: A sigil thief attempts to steal from the party.
• 2 SB: Buyer names an ally, creating internal conflict.
• 3 SB: Stone groans, causing environmental hazards.
• 4+ SB: Threshold tears open, unleashing something ancient and hungry.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the threshold tears or when allies are named—omens of magical theft, debts of violated traditions.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THE COVEN OF THE SILVER MOON, BETRAYED"
Why This Name Matters: The coven had an identity beyond being a source of magical knowledge.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Acrostic: Initial letters of sigil symbols spell the coven's name
• Palimpsest: Coven name visible only when proper moonlight falls on standing stones
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses community over individual gain

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Sigil symbols arranged in coven initials
• Actionable Lead: Arcana reveals their full identity in ritual texts
• Aha! Proof: Sway work uncovers their true story from coven elders

Extraction Test:
Arcana or Sway to restore their honor (on fail, more sigils are corrupted but reveal coven details).

Verification & Use:
Speak the coven's name while returning the ritual; mispronunciations cause the stones to attack (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Return It (blessing vs wards)
Restitution: Sell Again (gain Coin; draw Spade omen)
Renunciation: Bind the Gate (close a later hazard)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Boons: Coven's Blessing (once: +1d vs magical betrayal)
Burdens: Spade omen if you sell again; Ledger - Helped: Silver Moon Coven if you return it
Shard Kit: Sigil fragment grants +1d to recognize stolen magic later
Links: Reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you honored their name
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Coven of the Silver Moon • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The standing stones form a perfect circle, their surfaces etched with sigils that don't quite belong. In the center, a figure waits in fog, holding out coin for secrets that were never theirs to sell.

Exit Beat:
The stones ring clearly as the coven's name is spoken. The borrowed sigils fade away, and the circle finds peace in proper ownership.

## 22 — The City That Starved

**Memory in One Line:** He speculated on grain during famine.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • market • scales • hunger
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [6] — Spoilage spreads; grain-storm blinds; desperate mob gathers.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The market forces were clear—supply and demand, the natural fluctuation of resources. He told himself he was merely taking advantage of opportunities, that others would have done the same, that his actions were simply business. But while he profited from scarcity, families starved in the streets below. The weight of their hunger became the weight of his guilt, measured not in coin but in lives.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had watched their children grow thin, had traded away everything of value for a few more days of survival. When merchants hoarded grain while people died, when profit was valued over human life, it felt like a betrayal of the most basic social contract. Justice would have been compassion—sharing resources, prioritizing community over coin, recognizing that some things transcend market value.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his profiteering from suffering and make amends for the hunger he enabled.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Market of empty baskets; scales hang lopsided with the weight of inequality; the air reeks of desperation.
Anchors: Empty baskets, lopsided scales, grain ledgers, famine memorials, merchant contracts
Senses: The smell of decay and desperation; the sound of weeping and gnashing teeth; the feel of gnawing hunger
Adversaries/Agents:** Hunger wraiths, desperate mobs, grain elementals, famine spirits, corrupt merchants

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Trade → Unlock grain (DV 3)
• Command → Food line order (DV 2)
• Skirmish → Stop mob (DV 3)
• Rites → Invoke charity rite (DV 2)

Position Drift:

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Spoilage spreads to remaining supplies; grain-storm blinds with chaff and dust; desperate mob gathers with pitchforks and rage.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Spoilage spreads, destroying more food.
• 2 SB: Grain-storm blinds with chaff and dust.
• 3 SB: Desperate mob gathers, demanding food.
• 4+ SB: Hunger wraiths manifest, embodying the famine's suffering.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the mob gathers or when hunger wraiths appear—omens of economic cruelty, debts of enabled suffering.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THE STARVING CITIZENS OF RAVENHOLT, BETRAYED BY GREED"
Why This Name Matters: They were individuals with specific suffering, not an abstract economic concept.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Acrostic: Initial letters of famine dates spell the city's name
• Palimpsest: City name visible only when proper charity rites are performed
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses compassion over profit

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Famine dates arranged chronologically
• Actionable Lead: Trade reveals their full story in city records
• Aha! Proof: Command work uncovers their individual struggles from survivor accounts

Extraction Test:
Trade or Command to understand their suffering (on fail, more starvation occurs but reveals city details).

Shard Kit: Empty basket grants +1d to recognize economic injustice later

Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Citizens of Ravenholt • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The market square lies empty except for baskets that once held hope. The scales hang lopsided, weighted down by the measure of suffering, and the air reeks of desperation and decay.

Exit Beat:
The scales balance as Ravenholt's name is spoken. The empty baskets fill with simple grain, and the market finds justice in shared abundance.

## 23 — The High Stair

**Memory in One Line:** He let a rival fall to claim a seat.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • endless stair • rails • ambition
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [4] — Boot slips; third climber grabs ankle; rival's echo calls for justice.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The seat represented everything—power, influence, the ability to shape policy and direct resources. He told himself his rival was unworthy, that the organization needed his vision, his leadership, his superior intellect. But when the moment came and he could have extended a hand, he chose to step over instead. The rival's fall echoed in his dreams for years, a reminder that ambition had triumphed over basic humanity.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had worked alongside him for years, sharing ideas, building projects, earning their place through merit and dedication. When the crucial moment came, when they needed help to reach their shared goal, the betrayal cut deeper than any physical wound. Justice would have been sportsmanship—fair competition, mutual respect, the understanding that success was better shared than stolen.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his betrayal and honor the merit of his fallen rival.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Endless stair with two rails; one is greased, the other worn smooth by honest hands; the climb seems to go on forever.
Anchors: Endless stair, greased rail, rival's belongings, seat of power, climbing equipment
Senses: The metallic taste of betrayal; the sound of slipping footsteps; the feel of treacherous footing
Adversaries/Agents:** Rival echoes, stair guardians, falling hazards, ambition demons, climbing competitors

Your boot slips on the greased rail; a third climber grabs your ankle, trying to pull you down; the rival's echo calls for justice from below.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Your boot slips, causing a dangerous fall.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Acrostic: Initial letters of stair carvings spell his name
• Palimpsest: His name visible only when honest hands touch the good rail
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses integrity over advancement

Clue Ladder:

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The endless stair stretches upward, its two rails telling different stories—one smooth and worn by honest hands, the other greased with the residue of betrayal. Above, the seat of power gleams temptingly, while below, shadows gather like accusations.

Exit Beat:
The stair's treacherous rail smooths as Thaddeus's name is spoken. The greased section fades away, and the climb becomes honest effort once more.

## 24 — The Dragon's Loan

**Memory in One Line:** He took a predatory loan that doomed a village.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • coin-hall • drake • debt
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [5] — Interest compounds; draconic omen opens eye; village echoes plead.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The research required funding—rare components, specialized equipment, assistants who understood the work. The dragon's offer had seemed reasonable at the time, the terms fair for the resources needed. He told himself he could repay, that the village's temporary hardship would be worth the breakthrough he could achieve. But the dragon's arithmetic was cruel, its patience endless, and the debt grew like a cancer, consuming everything the village held dear.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had trusted him, believed in his vision, invested their hopes in his promises of a better future. When the dragon's loan came due, when their homes and livelihoods were seized for debts they had never agreed to, it felt like a betrayal by the very person they had supported. Justice would have been protection—shielding them from exploitation, finding ethical funding, understanding that some prices were too high to pay.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his role in their exploitation and free them from the debt he incurred.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Coin-hall with a sleeping drake bound in ink; golden ledgers stack like towers; the air hums with the weight of unpayable debt.
Anchors: Sleeping drake, golden ledgers, debt contracts, village memorial, payment altar
Senses: The metallic taste of coin and fear; the sound of counting gold; the feel of crushing debt
Adversaries/Agents:** Debt collectors, ink wyrms, village echoes, compound interest spirits, draconic enforcers

Approaches (Handles):
• Trade → Renegotiate (DV 3)

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):

• Palimpsest: Village name visible only when proper payment is made

## 25 — The Faith He Broke

**Memory in One Line:** He abandoned a patron's calling mid-rite.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • chapel • icons • apostasy
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [4] — Omen turns its face; icon drinks breath; faithful arrive demanding answers.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The calling had felt false, the patron's demands unreasonable, the ritual's requirements too restrictive. He told himself he was seeking a more authentic path, that the established religion was corrupt, that his departure was a necessary act of spiritual independence. But the truth was that commitment had become inconvenient, faith had become work, and the easier path was simply to walk away from obligations that no longer served his personal growth.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had invested their faith in him, seen him as a vessel of divine will, a bridge between the mortal and the sacred. When he abandoned the rite, when he turned his back on the calling that had brought them hope, it felt like a betrayal of their deepest beliefs. Justice would have been dedication—honoring the trust placed in him, completing what he had started, understanding that some commitments transcend personal convenience.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his abandonment and honor the faith that was placed in him.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Chapel half-lit; icons inverted; the air hums with broken devotion.
Anchors: Inverted icons, abandoned altar, faith records, calling scroll, prayer beads
Senses: The scent of old incense and broken faith; the sound of silent prayers; the feel of divine disappointment
Adversaries/Agents:** Faithful devotees, icon spirits, calling echoes, apostasy wraiths, divine enforcers

**Handles & Difficulty**

Omen turns its face in disappointment; icon drinks a PC's breath; faithful arrive demanding answers about the abandoned rite.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**

Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Congregation of the Radiant Dawn • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The chapel sits in half-light, its icons inverted like accusations against a faithless sky. The air hums with the weight of broken devotion, and shadows gather where prayers once illuminated hope.

Exit Beat:
The icons right themselves as the congregation's name is spoken. Light returns to the chapel, and faith finds renewal in honest commitment.

-## 26 — The Ward Unkept

**Memory in One Line:** He ignored a binding to chase a rumor.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • house • mirrors • counting
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [5] — Counting accelerates; mirrors disagree; captive shade grows stronger.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The rumor promised something greater—knowledge that could revolutionize everything, power that could make his current work obsolete. He told himself the binding was temporary, that the shade could wait, that his research was more important than routine maintenance. But the shade had been counting on him, trusting in his commitment, and his absence had allowed entropy to seep in, corruption to take root. In chasing the extraordinary, he had abandoned his ordinary duty.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had been promised protection, a safe harbor from the chaos of the world beyond. When their guardian vanished, when the wards grew thin and the boundaries blurred, it felt like being left to drown in a sea of their own fears. Justice would have been reliability—consistent attention to duty, understanding that some responsibilities couldn't be postponed for the sake of ambition.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his neglect and properly tend to the binding he abandoned.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: House with mirrored halls; a captive shade counting in the darkness; ward symbols flicker with fading power.
Anchors: Mirrored halls, captive shade, ward symbols, binding focus, counting device
Senses: The feel of being watched from multiple angles; the sound of obsessive counting; the taste of thinning reality
Adversaries/Agents:** Mirror wraiths, counting spirits, neglected ward guardians, reality bleeders, shade echoes

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Arcana → Rebinding (DV 3)
• Insight → Why he left (DV 2)
• Tinker → Replace anchor (DV 3)
• Skirmish → Contain spillover (DV 2)

Position Drift:
Finishing the binding raises Position next floor; freeing the shade drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Counting accelerates to a maddening rhythm; two mirrors disagree about reality, creating paradox; the captive shade grows stronger and more demanding.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Counting accelerates, causing mental stress.
• 2 SB: Mirror reflections show different truths, creating confusion.
• 3 SB: Two mirrors disagree, causing reality distortions.
• 4+ SB: The captive shade fully manifests, demanding release or proper binding.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when mirrors disagree or when the shade manifests—omens of neglected duty, debts of broken protection.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THE SHADE OF MARGARET THORNFIELD, NEGLECTED IN DUTY"
Why This Name Matters: Restoring her identity acknowledges she was more than just a maintenance task.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Palimpsest: Her name visible only when proper warding light touches the mirrors
• Syllable Scavenger: Fragments of her name found in the counting sequence
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses responsibility over ambition

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Counting sequence includes numbers that spell her initials
• Actionable Lead: Arcana reveals her full story in binding records
• Aha! Proof: Insight uncovers why she needed protection from her own history

Extraction Test:
Arcana or Insight to understand her needs (on fail, the binding becomes more unstable but reveals her middle name).

Verification & Use:
Speak her full name while completing the binding; mispronunciations cause the mirrors to shatter (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Finish the Binding (boon vs ghosts)
Restitution: Free the Shade (ally later; draw Deck)
Renunciation: Break All Mirrors (scene safer; lose ally)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Boons: Proper Binding (once: +1d vs spectral intrusion)
Burdens: Deck draw if you free the shade; Ledger - Helped: Margaret if you finish binding
Shard Kit: Ward symbol grants +1d to recognize neglected responsibilities later
Links: Reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you honored her name
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Margaret Thornfield • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The mirrored halls stretch endlessly, each reflection showing a slightly different version of yourself. In the distance, a shade counts obsessively, and ward symbols flicker like dying stars.

Exit Beat:
The mirrors align as Margaret's name is spoken. The counting settles into a peaceful rhythm, and the house finds stability in proper care.

## 27 — The Pilgrim's Road

**Memory in One Line:** He extorted pilgrims for passage.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • gatehouse • tally-rope • oath
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [4] — Saint's bell rings; riot starts; pilgrim echoes grow desperate.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The gatehouse was his responsibility, a position of trust that came with the right to demand reasonable fees for passage. He told himself the tolls were fair, that pilgrims could afford them, that his services were valuable enough to justify the cost. But as the fees grew higher and the demands more unreasonable, as families were turned away for lack of coin, he had become a barrier to faith itself rather than a facilitator of spiritual journey.

From the Harmed Party's Perspectives:
They had saved for years, sacrificed everything, to make this pilgrimage—a sacred journey that was supposed to be about faith, not finance. When they were turned away for lack of coin, when their devotion was measured in copper instead of commitment, it felt like a betrayal of everything the journey was meant to represent. Justice would have been accessibility—ensuring that spiritual seeking wasn't held hostage by material wealth.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his extortion and restore the sacred nature of the pilgrimage.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Gatehouse with tally-rope and oath-bucket; pilgrim tokens scatter the ground; the air hums with frustrated devotion.
Anchors: Gatehouse, tally-rope, oath-bucket, pilgrim tokens, sacred way markers
Senses: The metallic taste of coin and disappointment; the sound of frustrated prayers; the feel of blocked spiritual yearning
Adversaries/Agents:** Pilgrim echoes, toll enforcers, saint's avatars, frustrated wayfarers, oath guardians

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Law → Revoke toll (DV 2)
• Sway → Refund ritual (DV 3)
• Trade → Pay now, leverage later (DV 3)
• Skirmish → Stand-down guards (DV 2)

Position Drift:
Refunding raises Position next floor; keeping tolls drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
A saint's bell rings in disapproval; a riot starts among frustrated pilgrims; the oath-bucket overflows with broken promises.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: A saint's bell rings, marking divine disapproval.
• 2 SB: Pilgrim tokens multiply, creating confusion.
• 3 SB: A riot starts, with pilgrims demanding passage.
• 4+ SB: The oath-bucket overflows, unleashing the weight of broken promises.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the saint's bell rings or when the oath-bucket overflows—omens of spiritual corruption, debts of blocked faith.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THE PILGRIMS OF THE SACRED WAY, DENIED PASSAGE"
Why This Name Matters: They were seekers with a shared spiritual purpose, not just customers to be exploited.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Acrostic: Initial letters of sacred way markers spell "pilgrims"
• Palimpsest: Pilgrim name visible only when proper reverence is shown to tokens
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses faith over profit

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Sacred way markers arranged in pilgrim formation
• Actionable Lead: Law reveals their full story in pilgrimage records
• Aha! Proof: Sway work uncovers their individual spiritual journeys

Extraction Test:
Law or Sway to understand their quest (on fail, more pilgrims are turned away but reveal way marker details).

Verification & Use:
Speak the pilgrims' collective name while opening the gate; mispronunciations cause the way markers to turn hostile (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Refund (Public Grace)
Restitution: Keep Tolls (resources; Stain)
Renunciation: Turn the Gate (open safe shortcut later)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Boons: Pilgrim's Blessing (once: +1d to sacred journeys)
Burdens: Stain if you keep tolls; Ledger - Helped: Pilgrims if you refund
Shard Kit: Pilgrim token grants +1d to recognize spiritual sincerity later
Links: Reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you honored their quest
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Pilgrims of the Sacred Way • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The gatehouse stands before you, its tally-rope marked with the weight of countless tolls. Pilgrim tokens scatter the ground like fallen hopes, and the air hums with frustrated devotion and broken promises.

Exit Beat:
The gate swings open as the pilgrims' name is spoken. The tally-rope unravels, and the way becomes clear for all who seek with honest hearts.

## 28 — The Crown of Ashes

**Memory in One Line:** He accepted a crown promised to another.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • throne room • ash • crowns
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [6] — Ash-snow blinds; spectral court demands oaths; rightful heir's echo rises.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The crown had been within reach, the power so close he could taste it. He told himself the rightful heir was unworthy, that the kingdom needed his vision, his strength, his superior capabilities. But the truth was simpler: ambition had overwhelmed honor, and he had taken what was never his to claim. The other candidate had been chosen by tradition, by the will of the people, by promises made in good faith—and he had cast all of that aside for the sake of personal glory.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had been chosen through proper channels, had earned the right to rule through birth, preparation, and the trust of advisors. When that choice was overturned, when their destiny was stolen by someone more opportunistic, it felt like a theft of their very identity. Justice would have been recognition—honoring the established process, respecting the will of those who had made the choice.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his usurpation and restore the rightful order he disrupted.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Throne room under drifting ash, two crowns on one chair; spectral courtiers watch from shadowy galleries.
Anchors: Throne, ash-drift, dual crowns, succession records, royal regalia
Senses: The taste of ash and ambition; the sound of spectral whispers; the feel of contested authority
Adversaries/Agents:** Ash wraiths, spectral courtiers, rightful heir's echo, succession guardians, crown spirits

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Sway → Abdicate (DV 2)
• Duel → Trial-by-steel (DV 3)
• Evidence → Prove the promise (DV 3)
• Arcana → Split the crown (DV 2)

Position Drift:
Abdicating raises Position next floor; ruling by fear drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Ash-snow blinds all present; spectral court demands new oaths of loyalty; the rightful heir's echo rises to claim what was stolen.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Ash-snow blinds, causing disorientation.
• 2 SB: Spectral courtiers whisper accusations.
• 3 SB: Succession records catch fire, threatening to destroy the truth.
• 4+ SB: The rightful heir's echo fully manifests, demanding justice.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when the heir's echo rises or when succession records are threatened—omens of illegitimate power, debts of stolen destiny.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "PRINCE/COUNCILOR ALARIC STERLING, RIGHTFUL HEIR USURPED"
Why This Name Matters: Restoring his full title acknowledges his legitimate claim beyond being an obstacle to be removed.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Acrostic: Initial letters of succession law texts spell his name
• Palimpsest: His name visible only when proper regalia is placed on the throne
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses legitimacy over personal gain

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Succession texts arranged in his initials
• Actionable Lead: Evidence reveals his full claim in royal archives
• Aha! Proof: Sway work uncovers the court's true opinion of him

Extraction Test:
Evidence or Sway to validate his claim (on fail, more evidence is destroyed but reveals his middle name).

Verification & Use:
Speak his full name while placing proper regalia; mispronunciations cause the crowns to fight each other (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Abdicate (DV -1 later vs authority)
Restitution: Rule by Fear (Desperate tag sticks 1 floor)
Renunciation: Share Crown (unlock ally later)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Boons: Legitimacy's Shield (once: +1d vs authority challenges)
Burdens: Desperate tag if you rule by fear; Ledger - Helped: Alaric if you abdicate
Shard Kit: Royal regalia fragment grants +1d to recognize legitimate authority later
Links: Reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you honored his name
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Alaric Sterling • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The throne room lies under a constant drift of ash, two crowns resting on the seat like accusations against each other. In the galleries, spectral courtiers watch with eyes that remember betrayal, and the air hums with contested legitimacy.

Exit Beat:
The ash settles as Alaric's name is spoken. One crown fades away while the other settles properly on the throne, and the court finds peace in restored order.

## 29 — The Night of Names

**Memory in One Line:** He erased a persecuted lineage to hide himself.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • scriptorium • fading names • persecution
**Start Position:** Controlled
**Floor Clock:** [5] — Your name blurs; PC risks losing past; inquisitors close in.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The persecution was real, the danger immediate and deadly. He told himself he was protecting himself, that survival justified erasure, that the world would be safer without the association. But in hiding from his heritage, in denying his bloodline, he had become complicit in the very persecution he feared. The names he had struck from records, the histories he had rewritten, the family he had disowned—all of it was a betrayal of those who had come before and a rejection of who he truly was.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had done nothing wrong except exist, except carry the name that others found threatening. When their history was erased, when their very existence was denied, it felt like a second death—a theft not just of their lives but of their right to be remembered. Justice would have been acknowledgment—recognizing their humanity, preserving their story, understanding that identity wasn't something to be ashamed of.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge his erasure and restore the names he tried to forget.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: Scriptorium where names fade as you read; ancient ledgers show gaps where families once were; the air hums with forgotten identities.
Anchors: Fading scriptorium, name-gaps, family ledgers, erasure tools, identity records
Senses: The taste of forgotten words; the sound of names being whispered then lost; the feel of disappearing identity
Adversaries/Agents:** Name-hunters, identity thieves, inquisitor echoes, erasure spirits, family ghosts

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Evidence → Restore records (DV 3)
• Sway → Admit lineage theft (DV 2)
• Skirmish → Stop inquisitors (DV 3)
• Arcana → Fix name-magic (DV 2)

Position Drift:
Restoring line raises Position next floor; burning it all drops it.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
Your name blurs as the erasure magic turns inward; a PC risks losing their past to the same name-stealing effect; inquisitors close in, hunting for more hidden identities.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Your name blurs, threatening identity loss.
• 2 SB: Family ledgers show more gaps, indicating wider erasure.
• 3 SB: A PC risks losing their past to the name-stealing magic.
• 4+ SB: Inquisitors manifest, demanding to know hidden identities.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when names blur or when inquisitors arrive—omens of identity theft, debts of denied heritage.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THE STERLING LINE, ERASED IN FEAR"
Why This Name Matters: The family had an identity beyond being a source of shame.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Palimpsest: Family name visible only when tears fall on erasure marks
• Syllable Scavenger: Fragments of name found in faded ledger entries
• Emotional Key: Appears when a PC chooses acceptance over shame

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: Faded ledger entries spell family initials
• Actionable Lead: Evidence reveals full family history in hidden records
• Aha! Proof: Arcana work uncovers the true extent of the erasure

Extraction Test:
Evidence or Arcana to restore family honor (on fail, more names are lost but reveal family details).

Verification & Use:
Speak the family name while restoring records; mispronunciations cause more names to fade (harm 1) and add a clock segment.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Restore Line (honor family memory)
Restitution: Burn It All (safety now, haunting later)
Renunciation: Sign Your Own True Name (gain Anchor boon)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Boons: Family Anchor (once: immunity to identity theft)
Burdens: Future haunting if you burn it all; Ledger - Helped: Sterling Line if you restore
Shard Kit: Family ledger page grants +1d to recognize erased histories later
Links: Reduces Final Persuasion DV by 1 if you honored their memory
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: Sterling Family Line • Helped: [ ] • Unresolved: [ ]

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
The scriptorium's pages shimmer with half-finished names that fade as you look at them. Ancient ledgers show gaps where families once flourished, and the air hums with the whispers of forgotten identities seeking remembrance.

Exit Beat:
The pages stabilize as the family name is spoken. Letters flow into place like returning souls, and the scriptorium finds peace in restored memory.

## 30 — The Last Light

**Memory in One Line:** He chose lichdom to pay for everything.
**Tone Tags:** contrition • study • candles • choice
**Start Position:** Controlled if you showed mercy/restitution on ≥10 floors; Risky otherwise. Any violent approach starts Desperate.

**Extended Lore (For GM Eyes)**

From the Lich's Perspective:
The weight of his sins had become unbearable—a mountain of guilt that crushed every attempt at peace. He told himself that lichdom was penance, that eternal existence would give him infinite time to atone, that by refusing death he was refusing to escape from the consequences of his actions. But the truth was that he was afraid—afraid of judgment, afraid of oblivion, afraid of facing the final accounting of his life. In choosing undeath, he had chosen to postpone rather than confront.

From the Harmed Party's Perspective:
They had wanted many things—justice, acknowledgment, closure, the simple satisfaction of knowing their pain mattered to someone who had caused it. When he chose lichdom, when he opted for eternal self-torment over the possibility of peace, it felt like one final betrayal. Justice would have been courage—facing the consequences, accepting the end that comes to all mortals, understanding that some debts can only be paid with the ultimate sacrifice.

Penance Sought:
To acknowledge that his penance was complete and choose what comes next.

**Environment & Manifestations**

Space: A quiet study of candles. Thirty flames, each the height of a floor you climbed. The lich sits unarmed; the air is bright with names unsaid.
Anchors: Candle study, thirty flames, unarmed lich, name ledger, final choice focus
Senses: The scent of burning wax and old regrets; the warmth of thirty separate memories; the weight of final choice
Adversaries/Agents:** Memory echoes, guilt manifestations, thirty separate betrayals made manifest, the weight of accumulated sin

**Handles & Difficulty**

Approaches (Handles):
• Sway/Presence → Argue (DV varies by prior choices)
• Insight → Name what he fears to lose (DV varies)
• Evidence → Lay the ledger (DV varies)
• Rites → Open a door beyond (DV varies)

Position Drift:
Nonviolent approaches improve Position; violence worsens it dramatically.

When the Floor Clock Fills:
All candles flare simultaneously, forcing a final choice; memory echoes rise to testify; the lich's true form flickers between life and undeath.

**SB Spends (Revelation-Forward)**
• 1 SB: Candles gutter images of those you saved.
• 2 SB: Memory echoes rise to testify about specific betrayals.
• 3 SB: A beloved echo begs you to forbid forgiveness.
• 4+ SB: The lich's form becomes unstable, threatening to collapse entirely.

**Deck of Consequences:** Draw when memory echoes testify or when the lich's form becomes unstable—omens of final judgment, debts of ultimate choice.

**The Name-as-Key**

Key Name: "THE THIRTIETH NAME, THE CHOICE OF UNDEATH"
Why This Name Matters: The final name is the choice itself—the acknowledgment that he defined himself by his refusal to end.

How the Name Is Hidden (choose 1–2):
• Emotional Key: Appears when the party has shown sufficient mercy
• Ledger Lock: Must be written with all thirty previous names acknowledged
• Syllable Scavenger: The choice is spelled out in the first letter of each floor's key name

Clue Ladder:
• Gentle Nudge: The thirtieth candle burns differently from the others
• Actionable Lead: Insight reveals that the final choice is his to make
• Aha! Proof: All previous names must be spoken to unlock the final truth

Extraction Test:
The final test is not mechanical but moral—can the party convince him that his penance is complete?

Verification & Use:
Speak the thirtieth name while making the final choice; mispronunciations cause all candles to extinguish (harm 2) and force a violent resolution.

**Resolution Fork**

Mercy: Continue Penance (The lich seals himself deeper. Grant Fetter's Boon)
Restitution: Find Peace (He passes on; a Soul-Light remains)
Renunciation: Join the Living (He returns in frail flesh; a Mortal Oath binds him)

**Outcomes & Carry-Forward**

Boons: Soul-Light (1/arc: remove a Desperate → Controlled shift for one scene)
Burdens: Fetter's Boon requires the GM to bank +1 SB; Ledger - Helped: All previous if you find peace
Shard Kit: Final candle grants permanent +1d to recognize true contrition
Links: The final choice determines the campaign's legacy and any future encounters
Name Ledger Update: Harmed: All previous • Helped: Those you convinced • Unresolved: Those you couldn't reach

**Boxed Text (Optional)**

Entry Read-Aloud:
Thirty candles burn in perfect stillness, each one representing a floor climbed, a memory faced, a betrayal acknowledged. The lich sits before them, unarmed and waiting, his eyes reflecting the light of every name you have carried this far.

Exit Beat:
The final candle's flame dances as the thirtieth name is spoken. Whether it settles into peaceful darkness, continues its eternal vigil, or kindles anew with mortal hope depends on the choice made in this quiet study where all debts come due.
