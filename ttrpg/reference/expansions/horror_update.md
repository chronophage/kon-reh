TODO — Horror → “Noir-like” Revision

1) Core Clock Overhaul
	•	Introduce Personal Horror Vice Clock (4 segments per character).
	•	Mirrors Noir’s Vice Clock segment size and management: 1 Boon to prevent an increment this scene; 2 Boons to clear 1 filled segment.  ￼
	•	Reframe current Dread as a background pressure clock rather than the sole personal track.
	•	Keep Dread thematically present, but shift personal meltdown into the 4-segment Vice Clock to match Noir pacing/feel. (Noir uses a Case Clock + secondary personal clocks; we’ll mirror that structure.)  ￼
	•	Define Horror Vice categories (e.g., Obsession, Nihilism, Isolation, Forbidden Curiosity) and write 1–2 sentence triggers per vice that “tempt” a segment advance each relevant scene, as Noir does.  ￼

2) Trigger & Cost Alignment
	•	Adopt Noir-style automatic temptation triggers (“+1 segment per scene if vice is in play; spend 1 Boon to resist”).  ￼
	•	Keep Horror’s Breaking Point spikes as rare, high-stakes surges (force immediate advancement unless resisted), but let players counter them with the same currency logic (2 Boons to cancel).  ￼
	•	Normalize Boon economy text so prevention/clearing language matches Noir’s clarity (prevent this scene = 1 Boon; clear 1 segment = 2 Boons).  ￼

3) Penalty Curve (Vice-State Effects)
	•	Swap Dread’s long 10-step severity ladder for a 4-step Vice penalty band (light → crisis), paralleling Noir’s “worse at each filled segment.” Draft a compact penalty table akin to Noir’s Quick Reference (e.g., +SB generation, -dice to resist, crisis lockout at 4).  ￼
	•	Keep the iconic Horror “Broken” state but tie it to stacking crises (e.g., hit 4 on Vice Clock while the global threat clock is high). Dread’s psychological tiers become guidance text and complication prompts, not the primary personal track.  ￼

4) Campaign Clock Structure (Noir Parity)
	•	Retain Horror’s Reality Fracture / Existential Threat clocks, but make them behave like Noir’s external clocks (Pressure/Reputation): they accelerate when Vice is high, and vice versa. Add a “Threat Clock” that acts like Noir’s Case Clock to pace the scenario.  ￼  ￼
	•	Add a short “Clock Interaction” note: high Vice → faster Threat advancement (bad decisions); high Threat → more frequent Vice temptations/breaking points (stress feedback loop).  ￼

5) Procedures & GM Aids
	•	Write a “Vice in Play” box for scene framing (investigation, social, action, moral choice), mirroring Noir’s scene taxonomy, with a one-liner on when to offer a temptation.  ￼
	•	Convert Horror’s Complication Generator tags to flag “vice temptations” explicitly (e.g., “isolation looks safe → Isolation vice tempts +1”).  ￼
	•	Add a one-page Quick Reference: Vice triggers, costs, penalty bands, and how they interact with Reality Fracture/Threat.

6) Rewards & Advancement
	•	Mirror Noir’s XP nudges for vice management (resist at a cost, accept fallout, transform flaw into growth) and blend with Horror’s existing awards for breaking-point engagement.  ￼  ￼
	•	Call out Boon→XP conversion parity so resource sinks feel consistent across expansions.  ￼

7) Player-Facing Materials
	•	Update character sheets with a 4-segment Horror Vice Clock (space for vice name + 2–3 bespoke triggers).
	•	Session 0 prompts to pick a vice, define a personal “tell,” and write 2 temptation beats specific to that character (aligns to Noir’s character-integrated setup).  ￼

8) Text Edits (Where to Patch)
	•	Horror 2.1–3.3: Recast Dread as campaign/background pressure; insert Personal Vice Clock section; rename “Dread advancement” callouts in examples to “Vice temptation (prevent 1 Boon).”  ￼  ￼
	•	Horror 4.3: Keep Breaking Points, but add a sidebar “When to offer a Vice temptation vs. a Breaking Point.”  ￼
	•	Horror 5.1 Quick Launch: Swap the tutorial beats to demonstrate: (1) one Vice temptation, (2) one Breaking Point, (3) Threat Clock tick.  ￼
	•	Add a “Cross-Expansion Compatibility” callout explicitly stating Noir/Horror parity (already gestured at—make it concrete with Vice Clock language).  ￼

9) Playtest Checklist (1–2 sessions)
	•	Do players feel agency via spend-to-prevent and spend-to-clear?
	•	Does 4-segment pacing create the intended “noir-like” urgency?
	•	Are Breaking Points rare and scary (not spammy)?
	•	Do Threat/Fracture clocks react visibly to Vice levels (both directions)?
