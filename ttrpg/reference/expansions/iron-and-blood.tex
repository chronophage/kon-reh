\maketitle

\begin{quote}\footnotesize
\emph{On terms:} some Ecktorian broadsheets and street cant use ``orc'' as a slur for Ykrul communities. In play, treat it as prejudice with consequences. The peoples name themselves \textbf{Ykrul}, with many local kin-names besides.
\end{quote}

\vspace{-0.5em}
\section*{Design Goals}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Reputation and reality:} Ykrul bank on a fierce reputation on the open plain---and then win by routes, supply, and parleys that make blades unnecessary.
  \item \textbf{Plural lives:} herders, pilots, weavers, judges, scouts, factors, captains; warfare is one tool among many.
  \item \textbf{Kon'reh in the marrow:} the board's geometry informs roads, exits, concessions, and seasonal rights.
  \item \textbf{Core-first:} Position/DV/Effect, clocks, and Strings do the work; no new math.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Quickstart (2 minutes)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Choose your lens: \textbf{Road-Clan PCs} • \textbf{Mixed Company} • \textbf{Outsiders Among Ykrul}
  \item Pick a home ground: \textbf{Meadow Commons} • \textbf{Mountain Holds} • \textbf{Salt Coasts} • \textbf{Eastern Steppes}
  \item Mark \textbf{Repute [6]}, \textbf{Standing [6]}, \textbf{Debts [4]} (opt. \textbf{Marks [6]} for toil/weather)
  \item Choose \textbf{2 Kin Gifts} and \textbf{1 Bond} (trade, craft, law, or defense)
  \item Start with \textbf{1 String} (e.g., windbreak right) and \textbf{1 Obligation} (e.g., ford dues)
  \item Map 4--6 \textbf{nodes} and light local clocks: \clock{Market Moot}{4}, \clock{Winter Drive}{6}, \clock{Border Ride}{6} (swap in \clock{Blood-Feud}{4} only if fiction calls for it)
  \item Open with a situation: \textbf{Passage Negotiation} • \textbf{Winter Drive} • \textbf{Harbor Dues} • \textbf{Kon'reh Arbitration}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ykrul — The People of the Violet Steppe}

\subsection*{Kon'reh as sacred geometry, memory of the Wake, and a world seen in lines, weights, and exits}

\begin{quote}
``Through the Wake, Across the Meadow, Into the Stone.''
\end{quote}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{I. The Great Migration (Wake-Law)}

Ykrul memory begins with flight: homesteads abandoned under a wrong sky, flotillas stitched from last ropes, and an ocean learned by star and sound. They call that crossing the \textbf{Great Wake}. Every clan keeps a coil of salt-stiff rope---the \textbf{Salt Line}---uncoiled before serious speech to place all present ``under Wake-law'': plain words, straight debts, no riddles.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{First Meadow.} Landfall was a long, violet grassland. Its color---ironweed, crocus, mallow---named their world: the \emph{Violet Steppe}.
  \item \textbf{Wake Names.} Many wear a second name granted by the sea (\emph{Wave-Left}, \emph{Stern-Watcher}), which can be invoked for one unlooked-for courtesy ``as kin on the crossing.''
  \item \textbf{Rites that stuck.} A handful of salt in a new road's rut; a black river stone atop an elder's cairn; a song that lists exits before listing enemies.
\end{itemize}

\emph{How they think:} the Wake taught them that survival comes from reading \textbf{flow} (what moves), \textbf{weight} (what holds), and \textbf{exit} (what opens). Kon'reh will codify this---but the Wake is the first proof.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{II. Lands After Landfall}

\subsubsection*{The Violet Steppe (Meadow)}
Wind, hooves, and shallow lakes. Herd-bands form \emph{ring-camps} (tents inward, cookfires outward); visitors call at the outer fire and announce themselves. Major decisions take place ``by \textbf{Bowl and Board}'': the \emph{Bowl} to test plain fairness, the \emph{Board} to model routes and concessions.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Strings of the Meadow:} rain-marker rod; herd-tally braid; windbreak right; salt share.
  \item \textbf{Persistent worries:} black gnats; rivers that change their beds overnight; border rides that test how far a ring will bend.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{The Eastern Steppes}
Vaster, colder, older. \emph{Sky cairns} mark wind and weather; riders replace a fallen stone and leave an ember as courtesy to strangers and spirits. Ward-storms roll in sheets; Kon'reh analogies (flow/weight/exit) double as actual storm-reading.

\subsubsection*{Mountain Holds}
Knife ridges and pass-stones. Mountain Ykrul are infamous even among Aeler captains: hard meat, harder hospitality. They swear \textbf{Stone-Oaths} at marked passes and genuinely believe a broken promise wakes the ridge (and avalanches have a long memory). Climbing gear is braided rope and iron wrapped in cloth; iron bares teeth only in war.

\subsubsection*{Salt Coasts}
Sea Ykrul cut sleet-thin wake-cutters and braid hullcraft with Linnic tricks. Harbor politics oscillate between \textbf{Blue Moots} (truce and tariff) and dawn raids. They swear by the \textbf{Three Knots} (helm, mast, rudder) and settle maritime disputes at a beach-board chalked into wet sand.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{III. Kon'reh: Sacred Geometry Lived}

Kon'reh is both a table game and a theology of place: the \emph{Meadow} (pressure and path), the \emph{River} (flow and change), the \emph{Stone} (weight and witness). The \emph{Concordance}---commentary cycles on Kon'reh and cosmology---treats roads, rivers, and ridges as the language of intention. Ykrul do not separate ``strategy'' from ``ethic''---to place well is to behave well: no route you can't defend, no exit you build only to close behind weaker feet.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Bowl \& Board.} Public quarrels are fixed first by fairness (Bowl), then by geometry (Board). A concession on the Board becomes a season-long right at a ford, gate, or pasture.
  \item \textbf{Schools (as temperaments).}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \emph{Meadow School:} control the middle by promising exits you can afford.
      \item \emph{Mountain School:} weld lanes until only one honest path remains.
      \item \emph{Wake School:} trade tempo like wind; arrive before you seem to move.
      \item \emph{Aeler-influenced ledgers:} price the route---make bad paths expensive rather than forbidden.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Devotion without temples.} Shrines are boards carved in stone, lanes picked in cairns, and field-camps marked by ring and windbreak. The sacred is what holds under weight and gives under wisdom.
\end{itemize}

It's not their only game. Ykrul play \emph{river dice} (eddy-based gambling), \emph{knot puzzles} (one-breath releases), \emph{horse-circles} (precision riding), and \emph{salt-bones} (story-sticks cast in patterns). But Kon'reh is how elders teach children to think about promises, borders, and the dignity of ground.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{IV. Law, Diplomacy, War---Seen in Lines}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Guest Right.} A guest cup at the outer fire; theft ``under smoke'' brands your tent marks gray for a season.
  \item \textbf{Two Ledgers.} Said and meant are recorded together; offering both averts face-losing traps.
  \item \textbf{Blood-Price.} Paid in animals, salt, or length of rope; a band that refuses enters \emph{Red Weather} (others treat them as if a storm hangs over their camp).
  \item \textbf{Silence Furlong (with the Lethai-al).} A speechless border strip: no grazing, no felling, no names. Cross in silence, then speak once. Over time this produced mutual isolation and a brittle respect; when the strip is honored, councils run warm---when not, gray-fletched messengers appear at dusk.
  \item \textbf{Pass \& Harbor Doctrine.} In mountains, hold what you must and never promise what stone will not bear. At sea, get there first or sing the storm together; a shared song is worth more than a sharp keel.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{V. People \& Institutions}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Meadow Judges.} A traveling trio who carry a bowl, a board, and a braid; their decision stands one season and one road.
  \item \textbf{Kon'reh Masters.} Teachers who arbitrate by geometry; respected even by rivals. They rarely smile, often bleed for other people's mistakes, and will play anyone who brings a decent board and a decent reason.
  \item \textbf{Stone-Sons \& Rope-Daughters.} Mountain societies that test initiates on night crossings. Their braids anchor Aeler engines and their oaths make Aeler officers polite.
  \item \textbf{Wake-Wrought.} Sea families that list their hulls like saints; name the rivets of a stolen boat and you can claim it back under Wake-law.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{VI. Aesthetics \& Speech}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Colors:} violet (meadow), gray (stone), blue-white (wake).
  \item \textbf{Shapes:} rings, crosses, and stepped lines; carpets and tattoos look like maps.
  \item \textbf{Proverbs:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Leave two exits; take one.
      \item If the river bends, your story should too.
      \item A promise that cannot bear weight is a trap, not a vow.
      \item Never place what you will not defend.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Names:} given + road + deed: \emph{Sera of the Third Road, Who Turned the Herd}. Hand-signs say policy faster than words: palms down = camp law; fingers split = board; knuckles together = witness shut.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{VII. Rivals \& Kindreds}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Lethai-al (wood elves).} Ancient skirmishes shaped strict courtesy. The forest never forgets; the grass never lies. Councils hover between poetry and border drills.
  \item \textbf{Aeler (dwarves).} Mutual admiration where work meets weather. The Rope and the Ring---each holds where the other cannot.
  \item \textbf{Linns (mist \& iron).} Kinship of hull and hunger; borrowed sailcloth and storm-songs; first to the river mouth takes the season unless a Blue Moot is sworn.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{VIII. Festivals \& Omens}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Banner Day.} Spring match between bands: not about victory so much as who sets summer routes.
  \item \textbf{Blue Weather Choir.} Storm season rite where ships and camps sing exit-lists in antiphon with thunder.
  \item \textbf{Gray Hand Month.} When a band has failed blood-price; no mummers dance their fires.
  \item \textbf{Omens that matter:} violets closing at midday; cairn shadows pointing backward; a wind that tastes of copper; horses all looking east at once.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{IX. Adventure Seeds}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{The Bowl at the Ford.} Meadow Judges convene; a toll war brews between Sea Ykrul and Linns. Your party may broker a concession that becomes a season-long ford right.
  \item \textbf{Stone-Oath Winter.} A pass promise broke itself; avalanches argue like lawyers. Reset the oath before a rival Aeler captain ``fixes'' the ridge with iron.
  \item \textbf{Silence Furlong, Broken.} Someone spoke and cut grazing under the roof-trees; restore trust with a geometry both sides can live in.
  \item \textbf{The Stolen Board.} A Kon'reh Master's stones---heirlooms from First Meadow---are missing on the eve of a marriage pact. Recover them or design a substitute set both clans will accept.
  \item \textbf{Blue Weather Choir.} Ward-storms roll from the Eastern Steppes; sing with Sea Ykrul and Linn captains---or watch the harbor tear itself in half.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{X. Portraying the Ykrul}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Let geography talk first: route, exit, weight, witness.
  \item Treat Kon'reh as grammar, not hobby---how they make an argument about roads, borders, and mercy.
  \item Use Bowl then Board to structure any dispute: fairness $\rightarrow$ geometry $\rightarrow$ season-long concessions.
  \item Keep the Wake close: salt and rope as ritual memory; plain words when stakes are high.
  \item With rivals, play courtesy like a blade---sharp, exact, and meant to leave everyone standing if they choose.
\end{itemize}

\emph{For the Ykrul, Kon'reh is not simply a pastime. It is the proof that the world has form---and that people owe each other exits.}

\section{Repute, Standing, Debts}

0–2: distrusted (Position --1 in negotiation) • 3–4: reliable • 5–6: sought-after (Position +1, tempting target).

\textbf{Standing [6]} — weight in councils and moots.\quad
0–2: marginal • 3–4: contributor • 5–6: chair/warden (responsibility clocks light).

\textbf{Debts [4]} — dues, oaths, promises.\quad
At full: dues come due (court, kin, or market).

\section{How Ykrul Win (beyond the blade)}
\subsection*{Banked Fear (Reputation Economy)}
On entering a venue where your fierce name precedes you, mark \textbf{Banked Fear (1)}.\\
\emph{Spend 1:} force \textbf{Parley First} (one roll of talk before a fight can start) \emph{or} shift one enemy action to \textbf{Risky} (they flinch at your name).\\
If you bluff and then fail to deliver, erase all Banked Fear until you win publicly.

\subsection*{Logistics Edge (Strings \textrightarrow\ DV)}
Convert any \textbf{cache String} (fodder lot, water right, hidden wharf) into \textbf{DV --1} on a relevant leg or score. If used to starve an innocent district, flip it: DV --1 becomes a public \textbf{Debts +1}.

\subsection*{Kon'reh Arbitration (Geometry of Mercy)}
Model roads, exits, and lanes in talk. On success, create a \textbf{Seasonal Concession String} at a ford/harbor/pass that either side may call once/season without offense.

\section{The Vilikari Compact (four autumns)}
\subsection*{A ledger written in other hands}
The Ykrul and Vilikari have fought, married, traded, and cheated together across three coasts. The Syndicate likes coin that moves; the Ykrul like routes that hold. Between them grew the \textbf{Compact}: when Ykrul choose \emph{where} and \emph{when}, Vilikari decide \emph{how hard}.

\subsubsection*{The Four Sacks of Ecktoria}
Older Ykrul speak of \textbf{four autumns} when Ecktoria’s pride buckled. The banners were Ykrul. The bulk of the street-fighting were Vilikari crews---bought dear, pointed like a storm, paid on the steps. Quartermasters with Kon'reh boards widened alleys into lanes, closed gates with carts, and fed the fists who did the breaking. The lesson stuck: \emph{win the routes; hire the hands}. It left Ecktoria wary, the Vilikari rich, and the Ykrul rumor larger than their numbers.

\subsubsection*{Table Levers (Compact)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Hire the Hands, Own the Routes:} pay a Vilikari cohort with coin or cut; gain a \textbf{Fists [3]} asset and \textbf{Route Priority (1)} at one gate/ward for the score.
  \item \textbf{Two Ledgers, One Purse:} keep a clean ledger (said/meant) while paying dirty; on a strong hit, convert one \textbf{Crew Heat} into \textbf{Debts +1 (Vilikari)} instead of City Heat.
  \item \textbf{Autumn Memory:} in Ecktoria-only scenes, your name grants \textbf{Banked Fear (1)} even if unknown individually.
\end{itemize}

\section{Strings, Secrets, Nodes}
\textbf{Strings:} windbreak right; pass-stone mark; harbor priority; board-stone concession; wake-rivet list; cairn ember.\\
\textbf{Secrets:} hidden ford; old toll clause; moot-fixing scandal; Syndicate cut; winter cache.\\
\textbf{Nodes (pick 4--6):} Violet Meadow • Market Borough • Border Ford • Stone Hold • Sky Cairn • Coastal Harbor • Island Wharf • Rope-Bridge • Ring-Camp.

\section{Procedures \& Ladders (examples)}
\textbf{Passage Rights} DV 2 posted • 3 surge • 4 contested • 5 embargo.\\
\textbf{Harbor Dues} DV 2 public rate • 3 guild day • 4 faction squeeze • 5 blockade.\\
\textbf{Compact Hire} DV 2 desperate crews • 3 standard • 4 disciplined • 5 elite union.\\
\textbf{Kon'reh Talk} success = \emph{Seasonal Concession String}; miss = \emph{Market Moot [4]} advances.

\section{Regional Notes (quiet variety)}
\subsection*{Mid Ahkaz}
A city that learned to breathe in seasons: fairs that walk, courts that listen before they price, and neighborhoods where Ykrul calendars hang beside local saint-days.

\subsection*{Ecktoria}
Stone streets remember hoofbeats. Some doors open, some spit. Hirelings keep their eyes on the purse and the alley mouth. The Syndicate keeps longer books than it admits.

\subsection*{Vhasian \& Viterran Cities}
River towns price the tide; hill markets price the view. A banner can get you an audience; a good ledger gets you paid.

\section{Adventure Frames}
\subsection*{The Fifth Autumn (Social Heist)}
A Vilikari bloc wants to replay an old triumph in Ecktoria. You intend to \emph{not} sack anything: win a tariff by making the threat obvious and the routes yours. Bank fear, hire hands, feed them well, and leave with a contract.

\subsection*{Moot of Blue Weather (Diplomacy)}
Storm season and a choke at the river mouth. Call a Blue Moot, keep Linn captains in the room, convince Syndicate brokers the rate holds, and make the tide window safe for all without giving away the lane.

\subsection*{Silence Furlong, Mended (Frontier)}
A speechless strip on the border frayed. Walk it clean, pay old dues, set a seasonal concession stone both sides can live with, and escort a caravan through without drawing.

\section{Example of Play}
\textbf{Setup:} Meadow negotiators (Caravan Craft, Route-Planning) and coastal pilots (Harbor Dues) work an Ecktorian tariff crisis. A Vilikari bloc offers fists if the purse is right.

\textbf{Play:} Banked Fear earns \emph{Parley First}. Kon'reh Talk frames a seasonal lane and exit. Compact Hire brings disciplined crews who never need to swing---their presence is enough once the food and coin are sure. Logistics Edge burns a cache String for DV --1 on the night’s movements. By dawn, the city posts a rate. No sack, no siege; a contract and a story.

\textbf{Outcome:} \emph{Market Moot [4]} clears; \emph{Seasonal Concession String: harbor priority} created; \emph{Debts +1 (Vilikari)} noted for the purse that made it all graceful.

\section{Aveh — The Rider Behind the Storm}

\subsection*{Non-binary patron of freedom, edges, and the unclaimed road}

\begin{quote}
``No road owns me. No name cages you. Ride.''
\end{quote}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{I. Names, Faces, Signs}

Aveh rides where borders fray: along stormfronts, river booms, city rooftops, ridgebacks, and the hush between a question and an answer. Neither man nor woman (and not ``both'' so much as \emph{other}), Aveh is called when people refuse a cage or cannot fit the one built for them.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Epithets:} The Unreined; Way-Mercy; Break-Reins; The Door in the Wind; The Rider Without Shadow.
  \item \textbf{Signs:} an inverted bridle; a broken bit-ring; a wind-bell singing with no air; a spiral cloud with an empty eye; footprints that begin mid-path.
  \item \textbf{Shrines:} roof-altars with a single unlit lamp; bridle rings on cairns; chalk spirals at ferry posts; wind-bells hung under eaves.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{II. The Road's Mercy (Doctrine)}

Aveh’s teaching is simple and sharp, like rain on hot stone.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{No coercion.} Do not bind a will without its consent; do not be bound without yours.
  \item \textbf{Leave exits.} Every plan keeps a way out for the least of you.
  \item \textbf{Break bad bindings.} Vows made under harm or lie are weather to be ridden through, not walls to revere.
  \item \textbf{Keep witness gentle.} Names are gifts; use the ones people choose.
\end{itemize}

Among Ykrul, this reads as the conscience inside sacred geometry: a route is only honest if those who must walk it can refuse.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{III. Shrines, Rites, and Everyday Practice}

\textbf{Freehouses} (door-bells, unlatched latches) are Aveh’s favored shrines in towns and on roads. Custom says: \emph{no questions first, names after consent, doors unlatched unless danger presses.}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{The Open Name.} Speak the name you choose; listeners answer, ``Ridden and riding,'' acknowledging your authorship of self.
  \item \textbf{The Unknotted Door.} Loosen one knot a day: a stuck latch, a tangled cord, a bureaucratic snare for a stranger.
  \item \textbf{Storm Cup.} Keep a spare cup by the door; when the unlooked-for arrives, pour first, ask later.
  \item \textbf{Rite of Unnaming.} Ash on the brow, rainwater over the tongue: ``Unname the harm, keep the memory.'' Used to shed imposed labels while preserving history.
  \item \textbf{Break-Reins Feast.} At first storm of the season, bits are hung on a thorn or eave; those who cast off false ties pass beneath wind-bells and are applauded without questions.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{IV. Adherents \& Households}

\textbf{Nameless Riders} are wandering mystics of Aveh: weathered cloaks, a bell, and writs that petition courts or clans to release people from unjust bonds. Some practice \emph{total unnaming} for a season; wiser ones keep one thread (a color, a song) to anchor self.

\textbf{Households of the Open Door} are ordinary faithful: shelter-keepers, caravan hands who smuggle people rather than goods, clerks who ``lose'' bad papers, pilots who wave through the right boat on the wrong day. Chosen families flourish here.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{V. Law, Courtesy, and Crossroads}

Aveh does not despise law; Aveh despises \emph{coerced} law. In Ykrul country, \emph{Bowl before Board} becomes \emph{Open Name before Bowl}: the courtesy of naming precedes fairness, which precedes geometry. Harbor captains hang wind-bells during \emph{Blue Moots} to signal that refugees and misfits pass first. In courts fond of traps, Aveh’s folk keep two ledgers (said/meant) and make both explicit.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{VI. Omens \& Visitations}

A door that will not latch on a still night; a sudden scent of rain indoors; a bridle ring in a gutter; a lantern that refuses to light until a question is asked kindly. Aveh appears as a rider without reins, a voice like wind through reeds—precise, amused, never cruel.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{VII. Tokens \& Strings (in play)}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Wind-Bell (sanctuary).} Signals a place where the unlatched custom holds; once/scene, improve Position when seeking safe audience or exit.
  \item \textbf{Bridle Ring (oath-breaker).} Voids one coercive clause in a negotiation; converts it into a public concession clock.
  \item \textbf{Name-Shard.} Establishes chosen-name etiquette in a scene; disrespect carries social harm.
  \item \textbf{Storm-Scrip.} A small bag of cut cords; cash to soften a blockade or bypass petty gatekeeping without blood or bribe.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Optional table norm:} When a PC protects someone's autonomy at a cost, grant \textbf{Storm’s Favor (1)}; spend to shift Position/DV in escapes, parleys, and boundary crossings that harm no bystander.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{VIII. Cross-Cultural Notes}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Ykrul.} Aveh is the exit written into the board: never place what you will not defend, never close the last way out.
  \item \textbf{Aelinnel.} Two ledgers (said/meant) become sacrament; copper over iron in fraught negotiations.
  \item \textbf{Aelaerem.} Guest-right tilts toward the stray: bread \& salt first, genealogy later.
  \item \textbf{Linns.} Mast-bells ring in storm season; ropes are cut before hulls become prisons.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{IX. Adventure Seeds}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{The Door That Wouldn't Latch.} A latch refuses to hold; behind it, papers forged under duress. Fix the bind, not the door.
  \item \textbf{Break-Reins at First Storm.} A contract hides a coercive clause; ride the festival’s chaos to unmake it without blood.
  \item \textbf{Unbinding Letters.} Three border posts; three different lawful traps; one caravan carrying freedom writs.
  \item \textbf{The Nameless Rider.} A mystic erased so much that their allies forgot the revolution they began. Find the anchor and give the name back.
  \item \textbf{Blue Moot Without Toll.} Harbor captains demand papers from refugees; persuade them to declare a toll-free moot for one night—and hold the line when profiteers push back.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{X. Portraying Aveh}

Lead with courtesy that opens space. Make names holy and doors unlatched unless danger presses. Let storms change the scene \emph{toward mercy}. When in doubt, ask: \emph{Where is the exit, and who needs it most?}
