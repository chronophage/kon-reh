\chapter{To the Seeker of Shadows}

\lettrine[lines=3]{L}{}et me begin, dear reader, with a warning whispered in the dark hours before dawn, when the veil between worlds grows thin as a spider's silk. What you hold in your hands is not mere parchment and ink, but a gathering of truths that the light-bound would burn, the law-bound would imprison, and the truth-bound would deny.

I am Veyla, hedge-witch of the Tulkani, daughter of wandering merchants who taught me that the greatest treasures are those hidden in plain sight. My path led me to the worship of Ikasha, She Who Sleeps Within Shadow, and through her dark blessings, I have learned that power flows not from the sun's harsh light, but from the spaces between the stars.

\shadow{Rukhir tells me you are worthy of these words. He has been watching you, as ravens watch all who walk the paths between. "She moves with the caution of one who knows that shadows have teeth," he caws to me. "Her footsteps make no sound on the stones of secrecy." For a raven to speak of caution is high praise indeed.}

The rituals contained within these pages are not for the faint of heart or the weak of spirit. Each one demands a price, for Ikasha's gifts are never given freely. But for those with the wit to pay and the will to claim, they offer power that kings would kill for and gods would envy.

\section*{The Nature of Shadow-Magic}

Shadow is not darkness, child of light. It is the space between what is and what could be, the pause between heartbeats where truth whispers its name. In my years of walking the twilight paths, I have learned that shadow-magic is not about casting spells in the traditional sense, but about opening doors that others have locked and forgotten.

\shadow{Rukhir nods from his perch upon my shoulder. "The simple think shadow is absence," he says, preening his black feathers. "The wise know it is presence waiting to be acknowledged."}

The Tulkani understand this better than most peoples. We are wanderers, yes, but we are also watchers. In our travels, we have learned that every culture hides its secrets in the spaces between words, and it is in those spaces that true power lies. The shadow-magics I present here are drawn from a dozen traditions, whispered to me by spirits, traded with other seekers, and discovered through my own communion with Ikasha.

\section*{The Price of Power}

Before we begin, you must understand a fundamental truth: there is no such thing as free magic. The Utarans speak of balance, the Aeler of the deep laws, and the Wood-Elves of the cycle of giving and taking. In the tongue of my people, we say that every gift must be paid for in kind, and Ikasha's gifts are the most expensive of all.

\whisper{Listen well to this, for it is the most important lesson I can teach you:}

\begin{verse}
The shadow that you command \\
Will command you in return. \\
The secret that you steal \\
Will steal a piece of you. \\
The truth that you uncover \\
Will uncover truths about yourself \\
That you may not wish to know.
\end{verse}

\shadow{Rukhir caws agreement. "I have seen wizards become slaves to their own spells," he tells me. "I have watched sorceresses consumed by the very shadows they thought to control."}

This is why I have included not just the rituals themselves, but the warnings, the preparations, and the aftermaths. Each ritual in this grimoire comes with three sections: The Weaving (how to perform the ritual), The Price (what you must give), and The Whisper (what Ikasha will whisper to you in return).

\section*{The Tools of the Shadow-Witch}

You will find that shadow-magic requires few material components compared to the flashy spells of the light-wielders. Our power comes from understanding rather than force, from knowing rather than doing. However, there are certain tools that every shadow-witch should possess:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{A black candle} - Not for light, but for focus. The flame should gutter and dance as if in a wind that others cannot feel.
\item \textbf{A mirror of dark glass} - To see what others cannot see, and to guard against what would see you.
\item \textbf{A raven's feather} - For writing in shadow-ink that only the initiated can read.
\item \textbf{A small pouch of shadow-salt} - Gathered at the crossroads when the moon is new, used to mark boundaries and ward off unwanted attention.
\item \textbf{A whisper-stone} - A smooth stone that has been held in the mouth during a silence, used to store and release spoken secrets.
\end{itemize}

\shadow{Rukhir has brought me a bone from a hanged man, which he claims is essential for certain workings. I have not yet had the courage to use it.}

\section*{The Structure of This Work}

This grimoire is divided into four sections, each corresponding to a different aspect of shadow-magic:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Whispers and Secrets} - Rituals for gathering information, speaking across distances, and uncovering hidden truths.
\item \textbf{Shadows and Veils} - Rituals for concealment, transformation, and movement through spaces that should not exist.
\item \textbf{Dreams and Nightmares} - Rituals for entering the dream-realm, influencing sleepers, and drawing power from the unconscious mind.
\item \textbf{Bargains and Bindings} - Rituals for making pacts with spirits, binding servants, and compelling others to your will.
\end{enumerate}

Each ritual is presented in the same format:

\ritualname{Name of the Ritual}
\textbf{Purpose:} What the ritual accomplishes\\
\textbf{Weaving:} Step-by-step instructions for performance\\
\textbf{Price:} What must be sacrificed or risked\\
\textbf{Whisper:} What Ikasha grants in return\\
\textbf{Warning:} Important cautions and potential consequences

\shadow{Rukhir insists I add this final note: "Not all who seek power are worthy of it, and not all who are worthy seek it. Be certain which you are before you turn the next page."}

Now, if you have read this far and still wish to continue, then perhaps you are ready for what lies ahead. Light your black candle, settle into your chair, and prepare to learn the arts that others fear to name.

But remember, dear seeker - once you have seen into the shadows, you can never claim to walk in the light again.

\chapter{Whispers and Secrets}

\section*{The Art of Listening}

In the Tulkani tradition, we say that the greatest magic is not in speaking, but in hearing what others dare not say. The rituals in this chapter will teach you to listen to the whispers that exist in the spaces between words, to read the truth in a person's eyes, and to gather secrets that would make emperors tremble.

\shadow{Rukhir has been very quiet this evening. I think he senses that we are approaching dangerous territory. Even ravens have their secrets, it seems.}

\ritualname{The Listening Shadow}
\textbf{Purpose:} To hear conversations from great distances, particularly those that the speakers believe are private.

\textbf{Weaving:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Light a black candle at the darkest hour of night, when even the moon has set.
\item Take a raven's feather and whisper into it the name of the person whose words you wish to hear.
\item Bury the feather beneath your doorstep, or in the earth beneath a window where your target might pass.
\item For three nights, you must dream of shadows dancing. Do not fight these dreams - embrace them.
\item On the fourth night, the words you seek will come to you on the wind, spoken in a voice like rustling leaves.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Price:} You will hear one conversation that you desperately wish not to hear. This knowledge will burden you until you either act upon it or deliberately forget it.

\textbf{Whisper:} Ikasha will grant you the ability to distinguish truth from lies in any spoken word, but only for as long as you hold your breath.

\textbf{Warning:} Do not use this ritual to spy upon those who are innocent of wrongdoing. Ikasha favors those who seek justice, not those who indulge in cruelty.

\shadow{Rukhir shifts uncomfortably. "I have seen this ritual drive people to madness," he mutters. "The knowledge comes with the weight of responsibility."}

\section*{The Bonding Ceremony}
\textit{A ritual to strengthen connections between companions}

\textbf{Purpose:} Create a permanent bond between party members that provides mechanical and narrative benefits

\textbf{Participants:} All willing party members (3-5 helpers maximum)

\textbf{Channel Phase (Wits + Bonds):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each participant holds an object representing their connection to the group
\item Perform a shared activity (sharing a meal, telling stories, etc.) while focusing on the bond
\item Roll Wits + Bonds skill for each participant
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Weave Phase (Presence + Sway):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Participants speak words of commitment to each other
\item Create a physical symbol of the bond (knotting cords, mixing earth from homelands, etc.)
\item Roll Presence + Sway for the primary caster
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Backlash:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{1-2 CP:} Temporary tension between bonded members (-1 die to cooperative actions for Significant Time)
\item \textbf{3-4 CP:} The bond creates unwanted attention from external forces; party generates 2 CP whenever they act as a group for the next session
\item \textbf{5+ CP:} All existing bonds between party members are temporarily severed; party suffers -2 dice to all social rolls for Significant Time
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effect:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bonded members gain +1 die when aiding each other for one arc
\item Can sense each other's general emotional state across any distance for one arc
\item One "bond-mate" can be called upon for aid once per session (counts as Cap 3 follower for that action)
\end{itemize}

\shadow{Rukhir preens thoughtfully. "I have seen flocks torn apart by too-strong bonds," he caws. "The heart that beats as one can also break as one."}

\textbf{Duration:} One full arc, renewable with simpler weekly reaffirmation

\textbf{Casting Time:} Significant Time (ritual requires shared meal and ceremony)

\section*{The Sanctuary Consecration}
\textit{A ritual to create a safe haven from supernatural threats}

\textbf{Purpose:} Establish a protected area that repels hostile supernatural entities

\textbf{Primary Caster:} Spirit 4+, Lore 3+

\textbf{Helpers:} 2-3 participants with relevant skills (Lore, Faith, Arcana)

\textbf{Channel Phase (Spirit + Faith/Lore):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Gather materials sacred to the caster's beliefs or relevant to the threats faced
\item Consecrate the space through prayer, meditation, or ritual preparation
\item Roll Spirit + relevant skill for each participant
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Weave Phase (Wits + Ritual):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform the consecration ceremony within the designated area
\item Create permanent wards using blessed/sacred materials
\item Roll Wits + Ritual for the primary caster
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Backlash:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{1-2 CP:} The sanctuary attracts the attention of other supernatural entities; 2 CP added to next supernatural encounter
\item \textbf{3-4 CP:} The protection creates a vulnerability elsewhere; choose one party member who becomes more susceptible to supernatural influence for one session
\item \textbf{5+ CP:} The ritual backfires, making the area supernaturally dangerous; the space becomes a beacon for hostile entities
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effect:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Area becomes sanctified ground (Sanctity +2) against specified supernatural threats for one month
\item Hostile entities of the specified type suffer -2 dice to actions within the area
\item Area provides +1 die to resistance rolls against specified supernatural effects for one month
\item Party members resting within the sanctuary recover 1 additional Fatigue per night
\end{itemize}

\shadow{Rukhir circles the perimeter warily. "Sacred spaces are like nests," he observes. "They keep some things out, but they also keep you in."}

\textbf{Duration:} One month, renewable with weekly maintenance (10 minutes of ritual work)

\textbf{Casting Time:} Significant Time (requires preparation and ceremony)

\section*{The Memory Reconstruction}
\textit{A ritual to recover lost or suppressed memories}

\textbf{Purpose:} Retrieve information from a participant's suppressed or forgotten memories

\textbf{Primary Caster:} Wits 4+, Arcana 3+

\textbf{Helpers:} 1-2 participants with Insight or Lore skills

\textbf{Channel Phase (Wits + Arcana):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Participant enters a deep meditative state
\item Primary caster prepares scrying tools or ritual components
\item Roll Wits + Arcana for primary caster, Wits + Insight/Lore for helpers
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Weave Phase (Spirit + Insight):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Guide the participant through their memories using guided visualization
\item Use ritual tools to stabilize recovered memories
\item Roll Spirit + Insight for primary caster
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Backlash:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{1-2 CP:} Recovered memories are fragmented or unreliable; information may be misleading
\item \textbf{3-4 CP:} The ritual triggers traumatic memories causing temporary psychological effects; participant suffers -1 die to social rolls for Significant Time
\item \textbf{5+ CP:} Participant becomes obsessed with recovered memories; must make Spirit + Resolve (DV 2) rolls to act against the memory's implications for one session
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effect:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Recover one specific memory or set of memories from the participant's past (immediate)
\item Memory clarity depends on success margin (partial recall vs. complete recovery)
\item Participant gains +2 dice on related knowledge rolls for this scene
\item GM reveals one piece of information that connects the recovered memory to current events
\end{itemize}

\shadow{Rukhir tilts his head. "The past is a cage made of whispers," he says. "Some birds prefer to forget they were ever caged."}

\textbf{Duration:} Memory effects last for this scene; knowledge benefits last for this session

\textbf{Casting Time:} Some Time (requires deep meditation and guided ritual)

\section*{The Shadow Passage}
\textit{A ritual to travel through the Ways Between}

\textbf{Purpose:} Transport the party across great distances through shadow-realm shortcuts

\textbf{Primary Caster:} Wits 5+, Arcana 4+, Spirit 3+

\textbf{Helpers:} All party members (spiritual support during the journey)

\textbf{Channel Phase (Spirit + Arcana):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a circle of shadow-conductive materials (obsidian, black candles, etc.)
\item Each participant contributes a drop of blood or lock of hair to the circle
\item Roll Spirit + Arcana for primary caster, Spirit + Resolve for helpers
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Weave Phase (Wits + Ritual):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform the opening ceremony to breach the shadow-realm
\item Lead the party through the passage while maintaining the connection
\item Roll Wits + Ritual for primary caster
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Backlash:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{1-2 CP:} The journey takes longer than expected, arriving at an inconvenient time (advance relevant clocks by 1 segment)
\item \textbf{3-4 CP:} The party arrives in a slightly different location than intended; position for first action is Risky instead of Controlled
\item \textbf{5-6 CP:} Something follows the party back from the shadow-realm; introduce a persistent supernatural threat that tracks the party
\item \textbf{7+ CP:} The party finds themselves in the Ways Between.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effect:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Transport party instantly across great distances (anywhere on the same continent) for this scene
\item Arrival position is Controlled for planned destinations, Risky for improvised ones
\item +1 effect on the first action after arrival (momentum from the journey)
\item Party is immune to fatigue from the travel itself
\item Cannot be used more than once per week without increasing backlash severity
\end{itemize}

\shadow{Rukhir fluffs his feathers nervously. "The spaces between spaces have their own hunger," he warns. "They take payment in ways you won't expect until it's too late."}

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous travel with lingering effects for this scene

\textbf{Casting Time:} Significant Time (complex ritual requiring careful preparation)

\section*{The Geas of Binding}
\textit{A ritual to create unbreakable oaths or compulsions}

\textbf{Purpose:} Bind a willing or unwilling target to a specific course of action

\textbf{Primary Caster:} Presence 4+, Spirit 4+, Lore 3+

\textbf{Helpers:} 1-2 participants with relevant cultural or religious knowledge

\textbf{Channel Phase (Spirit + Lore):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prepare the binding materials according to cultural tradition
\item Research the target's nature and vulnerabilities
\item Roll Spirit + Lore for primary caster, relevant skill for helpers
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Weave Phase (Presence + Command):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform the binding ceremony with the target present
\item Speak the terms of the geas in the appropriate ritual language
\item Roll Presence + Command for primary caster
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Backlash:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{1-2 CP:} The geas has unintended loopholes or consequences; target finds creative ways to technically fulfill the geas while undermining its intent
\item \textbf{3-4 CP:} The caster becomes partially bound by the same geas; must also follow a related constraint for Significant Time
\item \textbf{5+ CP:} The binding creates a spiritual debt that attracts unwanted supernatural attention; 3 CP added to next supernatural encounter involving the caster
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effect:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Target is compelled to follow the terms of the geas or suffer spiritual consequences for one arc
\item Breaking the geas requires a successful Spirit + Resolve roll (DV 4+) each time
\item Failure to follow the geas causes 1 CP per day of violation
\item Geas can be complex but must be clearly defined (no "be good" - specify actions)
\item Willing targets suffer reduced backlash; unwilling targets may resist with opposed roll
\end{itemize}

\shadow{Rukhir caws sharply. "Words are chains made of air," he says. "But they bind tighter than iron when spoken with true power."}

\textbf{Duration:} One full arc, permanent unless specifically countered by equal magic

\textbf{Casting Time:} Significant Time (formal ceremony requiring proper ritual components)

\section*{The Communion of the Ancients}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Prepare the ritual space according to cultural traditions for contacting the dead
\item Offer appropriate sacrifices or prayers to the spirits
\item Roll Spirit + Faith for primary caster, Spirit + Lore for helpers
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Weave Phase (Wits + Lore):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the channel to the spirit realm
\item Guide the summoned spirit toward communication
\item Roll Wits + Lore for primary caster
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Backlash:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{1-2 CP:} The contacted spirit is confused or unhelpful; information provided is vague or misleading
\item \textbf{3-4 CP:} Other, less welcome spirits are drawn to the ritual; 2 CP added to next supernatural encounter
\item \textbf{5+ CP:} The ritual creates a permanent spiritual connection that cannot be easily severed; caster suffers -1 die to all social rolls involving living beings for one session
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effect:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Communicate with one specific deceased individual or type of ancestral spirit for Some Time
\item Spirit can provide information, advice, or warnings about specified topics
\item Spirit's knowledge is limited by their mortal understanding and perspective
\item Communication lasts for a number of minutes equal to the success margin
\item Spirit may request a favor or service in return for their cooperation
\end{itemize}

\shadow{Rukhir shivers, feathers ruffling. "The dead remember everything," he whispers. "But they forget what it means to be kind to the living."}

\textbf{Duration:} Some Time (ritual communication period)

\textbf{Casting Time:} Significant Time (preparation and ceremony required)

\section*{The Ward of Protection}
\textit{A ritual to create lasting magical defenses}

\textbf{Purpose:} Establish permanent or semi-permanent protective wards

\textbf{Primary Caster:} Wits 4+, Arcana 3+, relevant cultural skill

\textbf{Helpers:} 2-3 participants with Craft, Engineering, or cultural ritual skills

\textbf{Channel Phase (Wits + Arcana):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Gather materials appropriate to the type of protection desired
\item Prepare the location where wards will be placed
\item Roll Wits + Arcana for primary caster, relevant skills for helpers
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Weave Phase (Wits + Craft/Engineering):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Inscribe, construct, or otherwise create the physical components of the wards
\item Activate the wards through ritual consecration
\item Roll Wits + relevant skill for primary caster
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Backlash:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{1-2 CP:} The wards have a minor vulnerability or require specific activation conditions; wards function at -1 effectiveness until properly calibrated
\item \textbf{3-4 CP:} The wards attract the attention of entities they're designed to repel; 2 CP added to next encounter with specified threat type
\item \textbf{5+ CP:} The wards backfire, creating the opposite effect or affecting unintended targets; wards harm allies instead of protecting them for Significant Time
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effect:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create wards that provide +2 dice to defense against specified threats for one month
\item Wards can cover an area, protect specific individuals, or guard objects
\item Duration: One month, renewable with monthly maintenance rituals
\item Wards can be complex (multiple effects) but each additional effect increases backlash risk
\item Wards can be detected by those with appropriate skills and may reveal the caster's presence
\end{itemize}

\shadow{Rukhir examines the warding materials critically. "Boundaries are promises written in power," he observes. "But promises can be broken, and power can be hungry."}

\textbf{Duration:} One month, renewable with weekly maintenance

\textbf{Casting Time:} Significant Time (complex construction and consecration process)

\section*{The Veil of Misdirection}
\textit{A ritual to conceal the party's true nature and intentions}

\textbf{Purpose:} Create illusions and false impressions that mask the party's activities

\textbf{Primary Caster:} Wits 4+, Arcana 3+, Deception 2+

\textbf{Helpers:} 2-3 participants with Performance, Deception, or cultural masking skills

\textbf{Channel Phase (Wits + Deception):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prepare illusion components (cosmetics, costumes, symbolic objects)
\item Each participant contributes a personal item that represents their true self
\item Roll Wits + Deception for primary caster, relevant skills for helpers
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Weave Phase (Presence + Performance):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform the masquerade ritual, weaving false identities around each participant
\item Create shared illusion patterns that reinforce the group's fabricated story
\item Roll Presence + Performance for primary caster
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Backlash:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{1-2 CP:} The illusions have minor flaws or inconsistencies; -1 die to social rolls when under scrutiny
\item \textbf{3-4 CP:} The false identities begin to influence the participants' behavior; party members must make Wits + Resolve (DV 2) rolls to act against their assumed personas for Significant Time
\item \textbf{5+ CP:} The ritual creates a feedback loop where the false identities become partially real; participants suffer identity confusion and -2 dice to rolls involving their true skills for one session
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effect:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Party assumes completely fabricated identities that are believable to casual observers for one session
\item Each participant gains +2 dice to Deception and Performance rolls related to their assumed identity
\item Social interactions start Controlled when the false identities are relevant
\item Magical detection of true identities suffers -2 dice for Significant Time
\item Party can coordinate complex deceptions as a group action with +1 effect
\end{itemize}

\shadow{Rukhir preens his feathers with satisfaction. "I have worn many faces," he crows. "But I always remember which one is mine."}

\textbf{Duration:} One full session, requiring daily renewal (10 minutes of ritual work)

\textbf{Casting Time:} Significant Time (elaborate preparation and group ceremony)

\chapter{Part II: The Shadow's Embrace}

\section*{On Possession and the Compromised Soul}

\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{}he deepest shadows, dear reader, are not those that fall from candlelight or moonbeam. They are the darkness that grows within, fed by our own fears, our own compromises, our own willingness to trade pieces of ourselves for power. 

\shadow{Rukhir has not spoken much of late. I think he senses the weight of what I must record in these pages. Even ravens, I have learned, can be touched by shadows that should remain buried.}

In all my years walking the twilight paths, I have seen many seekers of power become its prisoners. The line between master and servant is thinner than spider's silk, and it snaps more easily than most would believe. When I speak of possession, I do not merely mean the crude taking of bodies by wandering spirits—though that too has its place in the dark arts. No, the possession I warn you of is subtler, more insidious, and far more dangerous.

\textbf{Player Character Possession:} This is not a condition to be taken lightly, nor one that should ever be inflicted without the player's consent and understanding. Possession represents the ultimate compromise of character agency—the point at which external forces have so thoroughly corrupted or influenced a character that they are no longer fully in control of their actions.

The Compromised condition of possession manifests in stages:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Stage 1 (Influenced):} Character begins to hear whispers, feel urges, or experience compulsions that are not their own. They retain full agency but must resist temptation through appropriate rolls.
\item \textbf{Stage 2 (Controlled):} Character occasionally acts against their will or better judgment. The possessing force can compel specific actions once per session, which the player may resist with a Spirit + Resolve roll.
\item \textbf{Stage 3 (Possessed):} Character becomes a puppet of the possessing entity. The GM takes control of the character for extended periods, though major life-or-death decisions should still involve player consultation.
\end{itemize}

\shadow{"Possession is not defeat," Rukhir finally speaks, his voice unusually grave. "It is transformation. And transformation, my dear Veyla, is always a kind of death."}

\textbf{GM Guidance on Possession:}

Possession should never be used as a punitive measure or to railroad players. It is a narrative tool of last resort, representing the culmination of a character's moral and spiritual decline. Before imposing possession, the GM should:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ensure the player understands and consents to the possibility
\item Provide multiple opportunities for the character to resist or break free
\item Make the descent into possession a gradual process with clear warning signs
\item Offer meaningful ways for other characters to help their companion
\item Respect the player's agency even when the character is compromised
\end{enumerate}

The path to possession should be paved with choices—each one a small surrender, each one making the next compromise easier. A character who deliberately seeks dark power should understand that they are playing with forces that demand payment in ways they may not anticipate.

\section*{The Ritual of Exorcism}

When possession takes root, when the shadow has grown too deep, there remains one path to salvation: the Ritual of Exorcism. But know this—exorcism is not a simple spell cast and forgotten. It is warfare. It is negotiation. It is sometimes surrender.

\textbf{Purpose:} To forcibly remove a possessing entity from a possessed subject

\textbf{Primary Caster:} Spirit 4+, Faith 3+, Lore 2+

\textbf{Helpers:} 2+ participants with Faith, Spirit, or relevant cultural/religious skills

\textbf{The Exorcism Encounter:}

Exorcism functions as a special encounter with its own clock mechanics. The ritual creates a contested space where the caster's will battles the possessing entity for control of the subject's soul.

\textbf{Exorcism Clock:} 2 + Subject's Tier in segments (minimum 4 segments)

Each segment represents a phase of spiritual combat requiring:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Channel Phase (Spirit + Faith):} Primary caster and helpers focus their spiritual energy
\item \textbf{Weave Phase (Presence + Command):} Direct confrontation with the possessing entity
\item \textbf{Response Phase:} The entity fights back—participants are Exhausted and cannot act for One Moment
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Entity Response Actions:}
During each Response Phase, the possessing entity may attempt actions that, if not resisted, advance the Exorcism Clock:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Whispers of Doubt:} Tempt participants with promises or threats
\item \textbf{Physical Manifestation:} Cause harm to participants or the subject
\item \textbf{Spiritual Assault:} Drain spiritual energy from participants
\item \textbf{Reality Distortion:} Create illusions or false visions to confuse the ritual
\end{itemize}

Participants may resist these actions with appropriate rolls, but failure allows the clock to advance by one segment.

\textbf{Defensive Support:}
Non-participating allies may concentrate on defense, providing +1 die to resistance rolls for each defender. However, defenders cannot take other actions during the exorcism.

\textbf{Ritual Failure:}
If the Exorcism Clock fills completely before the ritual succeeds, the exorcism fails with severe consequences:
\begin{itemize}
\item The possessing entity grows stronger (+1 die to all future possession attempts)
\item The subject suffers additional corruption (advance Sanity loss or equivalent)
\item All participants suffer Fatigue 2 from spiritual exhaustion
\item The entity gains knowledge of the participants' weaknesses
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For Player Characters:}
When a PC becomes possessed and exorcism fails, they gain complications based on the possessing entity's Tier:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Tier I-II Entities:} 1 CP banked each session from the entity's influence
\item \textbf{Tier III-IV Entities:} 2 CP banked each session from the entity's influence  
\item \textbf{Tier V+ Entities:} 3+ CP banked each session from the entity's influence
\end{itemize}

These banked CP represent the entity's ongoing influence and may manifest as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Compulsive behaviors or speech patterns
\item Nightmares or visions that provide the entity information
\item Uncontrolled moments where the entity acts through the character
\item Social consequences as others notice the character's changed nature
\end{itemize}

\shadow{Rukhir shivers, and I realize his feathers have gone dull. "Even I," he says quietly, "have felt the touch of things that would wear me like a glove. The difference, Veyla, is that I chose to be worn."}

\textbf{Player Agency Preservation:}
While possessed characters suffer ongoing complications, their players must always retain meaningful agency:
\begin{itemize}
\item Players choose when to resist the entity's influence
\item Major character decisions remain with the player
\item The entity cannot force the character to betray core relationships without resistance
\item Redemption paths should always remain possible, however difficult
\end{itemize}

The Ritual of Exorcism is not merely about casting spells—it is about the fundamental struggle between light and shadow, freedom and control, self and other. Approach it with the gravity it deserves, and remember that sometimes, the greatest mercy is to help a friend find peace, even if that peace requires them to let go of everything they were.

\textbf{Duration:} Variable encounter time, typically 20-30 minutes of game time per segment

\textbf{Casting Time:} Extended ritual requiring continuous focus and participation

\item \textbf{5+ CP:} The compulsion backfires, making the caster appear weak or cowardly; -2 dice to Command rolls for one session
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effect:}
\begin{itemize}
\item All intelligent beings within 200 yards must make Spirit + Resolve (DV 3) to initiate violence for Some Time
\item Successful resistance grants +1 die to subsequent social rolls with that individual
\item Failure to parley first creates 2 CP backlash when violence finally erupts
\item The bell's tone marks a sacred space of temporary sanctuary
\end{itemize}

\shadow{Rukhir preens. "Even warriors must pause to hear beautiful sounds," he observes. "It is in that pause that wisdom often speaks."}

\item \textbf{3-4 CP:} The barrier attracts attention from the wrong crowd; 2 CP added to next social encounter
\item \textbf{5+ CP:} The light becomes blinding rather than guiding; all within 50 yards suffer -1 die to perception rolls
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effect:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Creates a 50-foot barrier of soft, guiding light for Significant Time
\item Crowd movement is directed and calmed; +2 dice to Crowd management rolls
\item Panic effects are reduced by 2 CP for those within the barrier
\item The barrier provides dim illumination equivalent to moonlight
\end{itemize}

\shadow{Rukhir examines the light sources critically. "Light is a gentle master," he says, "but it demands respect from both those who wield it and those who would flee from it."}

\textbf{Duration:} Significant Time (approximately 1 hour)

\textbf{Casting Time:} Some Time (15-20 minutes of arrangement and ritual)

\item \textbf{5+ CP:} The sharing becomes too intimate; participants can sense each other's thoughts and emotions for one session
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Effect:}
\begin{itemize}
\item All willing participants share Fatigue and Harm equally for one session
\item Total Fatigue is divided by number of participants (rounded up)
\item Harm from attacks is distributed among all participants
\item Participants can sense each other's general health and location within 100 yards
\end{itemize}

\shadow{Rukhir tilts his head. "The heart that beats alone," he says, "can stop alone. But hearts that beat together... those are harder to silence."}

\chapter{Rites of the Binding Arts}
\label{chap:outer-rites}

\lettrine[lines=3]{O}{}ut there, beyond the lamplight and the last safe mile of road, the world unfolds into angles that do not ask permission to exist. Some call them the outer spheres; I call them the \emph{places that look back}. If you would traffic with such places and the minds that dwell there, you will not do so by reciting tidy cantrips. You will bargain. You will invite. You will bind yourself as surely as you bind them.

\shadow{Rukhir clicks his beak and tilts one midnight eye at you. ``She thinks she is ready to be \emph{kept},'' he croaks, ``but does she know what it means to be \emph{kept}?''}

These pages gather what the temple fires failed to burn: names that answer when called, diagrams that hum under the skin, rites that bear the weight of attention. Do not mistake them for common spellwork. A rite is a door you open with your own breath and blood, a vow you sign with the hours of your life.

\section*{Two Ways to Hold a Thread}
There are two roads by which a mortal may seat a rite in the bones:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ink and Iron: The Codex.} A book that knows you back. You will oil its hinges, press its leaves, keep its cipher fed with your hours. In return, it remembers the shapes that make the world listen.
  \item \textbf{Flesh and Feather: The Thiasos.} A companion who has \emph{already} heard a name you dare not say aloud. It is a mouth you borrow and a mirror you must feed.
\end{itemize}

Choose one. \textbf{Only one.} Those who try to carry both find their hands too full to grasp the next ledge.

\shadow{``Two cups at once and you drown,'' says Rukhir. ``Pick a vessel; sip with care.''}

If you keep a Codex, you will attend it. A neglected book sulks; a compromised one betrays. If you bind a Thiasos, you will watch its shadows and name its hungers. Either way, you do not walk alone thereafter.

\section*{The Price the Spheres Prefer}
Every calling across the veil is answered with a ledger. You may not hear the scratching of the quill at first, but the ink dries all the same. Each time you Invoke a rite, the one you call \emph{notices}. Their notice is not love and not hate; it is gravity.

\begin{verse}
Power borrowed is power tallied; \\
A boon spent is a bell rung. \\
When the bell is full of echoes, \\
Something comes to listen.
\end{verse}

When your tallies swell, the world arranges a lesson. Perhaps the sea decides it is done being polite. Perhaps a truth hounds you down the alley you thought was yours. Do not panic; do not run. Kneel, count the echoes, pay what must be paid, and move with care.

\whisper{Do not hide your costs from yourself. Hide them from your enemies, perhaps, but never from your own ledger.}

\section*{On Patrons and Their Proper Address}
Call them Witness or Geometry, Sea or Serpent, Fire or Law, Bone or Dream, the Elsewhere or the Red Court—names are handles, not cages. Treat each with the grammar they prefer. Order listens to proofs. Shadows favor vows made without torches. Seas respect the traveler who brings a tide of their own.

\shadow{``Say a thing as if the world already agrees,'' Rukhir advises, ``and half the time the world is too proud to argue.''}

Each rite you will meet below is written with \emph{The Weaving} (how to call), \emph{The Price} (what will be marked), and \emph{The Whisper} (what answer tends to come first). Read all three. Then read them again in a different mood.

\section*{Why You Must Not Serve Two Tables}
You will ask me, as all clever fools do: \emph{``Veyla, what if I keep both book and beast?''} And I will answer you as my aunt answered me: with silence, and a mirror.

A Codex demands \emph{attention}; a Thiasos demands \emph{presence}. Give both and you will split like spilled mercury. The outer spheres delight in halves because halves are easier to push. Choose. If one day you would change your choice, there is a knife for knots and a song for silence.

\section*{The Mercy of Severance}
There are rites to bind, and there is one to \emph{unbind}. I place it at the end of this gathering, under a black thread and a warning bell. We call it \emph{Cut the Knot of Patronage}. It is not a betrayal to sever a cord that is choking you. It is a kind of piety.

\shadow{``Mercy is a sharp thing,'' says Rukhir, preening. ``Only the kind learn to use it.''}

Do not attempt severance in mockery or haste. Bring witnesses who will speak your name without flinching. Bring an emblem of how you first said \emph{yes}. Bring enough quiet to hear the cord go slack.

\section*{How to Use What Follows}
Begin with one thread only. Learn how it pulls when you pull it. When you Invoke, mark; when you are marked, answer. If you carry a Codex, \emph{tend it}. If you walk with a Thiasos, \emph{guard it}. When attention gathers like storm-smell on stone, step under an eave and wait for the first fat drop. Then choose whether to dance, or to shut the door and count your candles.

\whisper{The spheres are not cruel. They are vast. Vastness feels like cruelty to those who will not look up. Look up. Then look back down and mind your footing.}

If you are still reading, you are ready enough to begin. Turn the page, seeker. The doors do not open themselves—but they do not stay closed for those who learn the grammar of keys.

\section{Design Premise}
Warlocks (here: \emph{Runekeepers}) leverage \textbf{Rites}---structured, named bargains with alien patrons and metaphysical forces. A Rite is not a spell; it does not use Channel/Weave. Instead, it runs on \textbf{Boons} and a \textbf{Patron Obligation Clock} that measures attention and debt.

\subsection*{Access Ladder for Rites}
\begin{description}
  \item[Low-Power Rites:] \textbf{Requires:} Thiasos Bond (Familiar — Talent). \textbf{Invoke:} 1 Boon. \textbf{Obligation:} 4-segment Obligation clocks. Familiar may Assist; no upkeep.
  \item[Standard Rites:] \textbf{Requires:} Familiar \emph{and} Codex of the Binding Art (Asset). \textbf{Invoke:} 1 Boon. \textbf{Obligation:} 5–6 segments. During Downtime, a Maintained Codex clears 1 segment on one associated Rite.
  \item[High-Power Rites:] \textbf{Requires:} Familiar \emph{and} Codex, plus \textbf{Tier III}. \textbf{Invoke:} \textbf{2 Boons} \emph{(or 1 Boon and mark +2 segments on Invoke)}. \textbf{Obligation:} 6–7 segments. Once/scene, this Rite may upgrade one result as written.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Shared Limits}
A Rite’s clock may gain at most \textbf{+3 segments} per scene (Invoke + Push It + Backlash). If a single Rite marks \textbf{2+} segments in a scene, the Thiasos is endangered (mark Exposure +1 on the familiar or suffer Harm 1 on it, GM’s choice). Rites are not spells and do not use the Casting loop.

\paragraph{Stacking}
Bonuses from \emph{scene-long} Rites do not stack with other scene-long bonuses from the same Patron. Apply the single best effect.
\textbf{Mutual Exclusivity:} A character can only be bound to one patron at a time. In order to switch patrons, a character must undergo \textbf{Exorcism of Patronage} (\S\ref{subsec:exorcism}).

\section{Core Procedure: Invoking a Rite}
\label{sec:rite-procedure}
\textbf{Invoke:} Spend \textbf{1 Boon} and mark \textbf{+1 segment} on that Rite's Obligation Clock.

While the Rite is in effect this scene, you may mark at most \textbf{two more} segments from the following triggers (each may occur once/scene per Rite):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Push It:} You use the Rite's ``\emph{Push It}'' rider (the bolder, alternative clause). \emph{+1 segment}.
  \item \textbf{Backlash:} A roll \emph{aided by the Rite} results in a \emph{Miss} or \emph{Success \& Cost}. \emph{+1 segment}.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Cap:} A single Rite can add at most \textbf{+3 segments} in a scene (Invoke + Push It + Backlash).

\textbf{Clearing:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item During play, you may spend \textbf{1 Boon} to clear \textbf{1 segment} on that Rite.
  \item During Downtime, a \emph{Maintained} \textbf{Codex of the Binding Art} clears \textbf{1 segment} from one associated Rite (\S\ref{subsec:codex-asset}).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Attention:} When a Rite's Obligation Clock fills, the Patron's attention manifests as a new thread/complication appropriate to that Patron. Start a named thread and escalate per your standard pacing. In horror campaigns, escalating the sanity clock is recommended.

\paragraph{Tags for Each Rite} List on every Rite:
\emph{Duration} (Action/Scene/Extended), \emph{Range} (Self/Near/Zone), \emph{Stacking} (Yes/No; list conflicts), \emph{Push It} (what triggers the extra segment).

\section{Character Options}
\subsection{Talent: Thiasos Bond (Familiar)}
\label{subsec:thiasos-bond}
\textbf{Cost:} 6 XP \hfill \textbf{Type:} General Talent \\
\textbf{Effect:} You bind a \emph{Thiasos}---a supernatural familiar (shadow, homunculus, fae beast, clockwork sprite, etc.) keyed to \emph{one} Patron. It may Assist actions involving that Patron's Rites (respect the +3 total Assist cap). The Thiasos follows Familiar rules for Exposure/Harm and \emph{requires no upkeep}.\\
\textbf{Risk Cue:} If a single Rite marks \textbf{2+} segments in a scene, the Thiasos is endangered: mark \emph{Exposure +1} on the familiar or suffer \emph{Harm 1} on it (GM's choice).
\textbf{To Re-Summon:} Pay 6 XP (original cost) or 2 XP + 1 CP banked during downtime. Re-summoning takes one week but can be done during travel.

\subsection{Asset: Codex of the Binding Art}
\label{subsec:codex-asset}
\textbf{Type:} Asset (Minor 4 XP / Standard 8 XP) \\
\textbf{Scope:} A Codex holds procedures for specific Rites (Minor: 1 Rite; Standard: 2--3 related Rites).\\
\textbf{Upkeep:} The Codex uses the Asset Condition track:
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Maintained} (full), \textbf{Neglected} (−1 die to Invokes tied to this Codex; cannot clear segments in Downtime), \textbf{Compromised} (unavailable).
\end{quote}
In Downtime, you may \emph{Study the Codex} to restore it to \emph{Maintained} and clear \textbf{1 segment} on \emph{one} associated Rite. \emph{On-screen} reshaping via the Codex (e.g., producing the right page or cipher at a dramatic moment) costs \textbf{1 Boon} as a standard Asset activation. \\

\subsection{Rite Costs (Learning)}
\textbf{Learn a Rite:} 6–12 XP. Requires either \emph{Thiasos Bond (Familiar)} \underline{or} an appropriate \emph{Codex}. High-stakes (12–14 XP) are typically Tier-gated at GM discretion.

\section{Rites by Patron}

\section{Ritual of Severance: Exorcism of Patronage}
\label{subsec:exorcism}
\textbf{Name:} \emph{Cut the Knot of Patronage} \quad \textbf{Type:} Ritual (Extended) \\
\textbf{Who:} The warlock, \emph{plus} 1--3 assistants (any Arts; distinct procedures). \\
\textbf{Materials:} A mirror veiled in salt-thread, anointed Codex page or Thiasos token, a personal sacrifice tied to the Patron’s domain. \\
\textbf{Procedure:} Over an extended scene, the circle denies \emph{names, signs, and vectors} that bind the Patron. Each helper offers a distinct symbolic inversion tied to their skill.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cost:} The primary invoker spends \textbf{2 Boons}. Mark \emph{Exposure +1}. Each helper risks 1 Fatigue on a \emph{Miss}.
  \item \textbf{Test:} GM sets DV by entanglement (typ. DV 2–3). On success, \textbf{clear the Rite’s Obligation Clock} to 0 and \textbf{choose one}: (a) \emph{Dismiss} your Thiasos \underline{or} (b) \emph{Seal} your Codex (cannot be used for that Patron until re-consecrated in Downtime).
  \item \textbf{On Success \& Cost:} As above, but the GM immediately starts a fading \emph{Echo} thread keyed to the Patron (2–3 CP over the next scene).
  \item \textbf{On Miss:} The knot tightens. Mark \emph{+2 segments} on the active Patron clock, and the GM introduces a \emph{Geas}-like demand or intrusion.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Aftermath:} You may switch paths (Codex $\leftrightarrow$ Thiasos) once the severance is complete and the inert resource is relinquished or reconsecrated in Downtime.

\chapter{Closing Words}

\section*{The Price of Knowledge}

\lettrine[lines=3]{A}{}s I set down my pen and watch the ink dry on these final pages, I am struck by the weight of what I have recorded. Each ritual, each warning, each whispered secret represents not just power gained, but power that has been tested, measured, and found wanting. For knowledge without wisdom is merely dangerous, and power without purpose is merely destruction.

\shadow{Rukhir has been silent for hours now, his black eyes reflecting the candlelight like twin stars. Even he, ancient as he is, seems wearied by the cataloging of so much darkness.}

In my years of walking the shadow-paths, I have learned that the greatest magic is not in the spells we cast or the rituals we perform, but in the choices we make when the candles burn low and the whispers grow loud. Every ritual in this grimoire has been tested—not just for its efficacy, but for its cost. And make no mistake, dear reader, each one demands a price that would make merchants weep and kings tremble.

The Bonding Ceremony can unite hearts, but it can also chain souls. The Sanctuary Consecration can offer protection, but it can also become a prison. The Memory Reconstruction can reveal truth, but it can also unleash madness. Each path we walk in shadow leads both toward power and toward peril, and the wise witch knows that the difference lies not in avoiding the darkness, but in understanding it.

\section*{A Word to the Keeper}

If you have read this far, then perhaps you are ready for what lies ahead. But readiness is not the same as wisdom, and wisdom is not the same as safety. The rituals I have shared with you are not toys for idle amusement or tools for petty revenge. They are the accumulated knowledge of those who have walked before you, paid their prices, and lived—or died—to tell the tale.

\shadow{"Knowledge is a burden," Rukhir finally speaks, his voice like rustling leaves. "And every burden leaves marks upon the bearer."}

Use these rituals with respect for those who taught me, for those who suffered for this knowledge, and for those who may yet suffer because of it. The shadow-magics are not evil in themselves—they are tools, like any other. But tools in the hands of the unworthy become weapons, and weapons in the hands of the desperate become destruction.

Remember always that Ikasha, She Who Sleeps Within Shadow, is not a goddess of chaos or evil. She is the patron of those who understand that truth often hides in darkness, that power often comes at a cost, and that sometimes the only way to fight the monsters is to become something monstrous yourself.

\section*{The Path Forward}

For those who would continue down the shadow-roads, I offer these final pieces of advice:

First, never trust completely. Even the most faithful familiar has its own agenda, and even the most loyal companion may be swayed by greater power. Trust, but verify. Love, but protect. Hope, but prepare.

Second, always remember that power is a responsibility. The ability to influence others, to bend reality, to peer into hidden places—these are not gifts to be used lightly. With each ritual you perform, with each spell you cast, you write your name deeper into the ledger of consequence.

Third, know when to walk away. There are secrets that should remain buried, powers that should remain unfound, and paths that should remain untrodden. Wisdom is as much in knowing what not to do as in knowing what to do.

\shadow{Rukhir spreads his wings, and in the candlelight, they seem to hold fragments of every shadow I have ever seen. "The end of one path," he says, "is always the beginning of another."}

Finally, remember that you are not alone. The Tulkani have a saying: "No shadow falls without light to cast it." In every darkness, there is the potential for illumination. In every ending, there is the seed of beginning. The rituals in this grimoire are not the end of your journey—they are merely the next step upon a path that has no final destination.

\section*{The Eternal Whisper}

As you close this book and prepare for whatever comes next, remember the fundamental truth that Ikasha taught me in my first communion with her shadow:

\begin{verse}
\textit{The deepest shadows} \\
\textit{Are cast by the brightest flames.} \\
\textit{The greatest powers} \\
\textit{Come from the deepest sacrifices.} \\
\textit{The strongest magics} \\
\textit{Are born from the most profound understandings.} \\
\textit{And the wisest witches} \\
\textit{Know when to let the darkness} \\
\textit{Consume them completely.}
\end{verse}

May your shadows be deep, your flames be bright, and your wisdom be greater than your power.

\shadow{Rukhir caws once, sharp and final, and I know that our work here is done.}

Until we meet again in the spaces between the words, dear reader, may the shadows keep you safe, and may the light never burn too brightly for your eyes.

\begin{center}
\textit{Finis}
\end{center}

\shadow{But in the world of shadows, nothing is ever truly finished. Only... paused.}

\end{document}
