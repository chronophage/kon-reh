# Vice Clock Guidelines

## Core Concept
The Vice Clock represents your character's ongoing struggle with personal demons that threaten to undermine their professional life and moral compass. It's a mechanical representation of the noir protagonist's fatal flaw.

## Vice Clock Structure
- **4-Segment Clock:** Visual tracker that increments during play
- **Increments:** +1 segment per scene (automatic unless prevented)
- **Prevention:** Spend 1 Boon to stop increment in that scene
- **Resolution:** Spend 2 Boons to clear 1 segment

### Escalation (When Full)
**Procedure:**
1. Draw new Vice card (same or different suit)
2. Apply appropriate fallout based on card rank
3. Reset clock based on new card:
   - Jack = 1 segment
   - Queen = 2 segments  
   - King = 3 segments
   - Ace = 4 segments (immediate crisis continues)

## Character Creation Integration

### Starting Vice Clock Values
- **Jack Draw:** 1 segment
- **Queen Draw:** 2 segments
- **King Draw:** 3 segments  
- **Ace Draw:** 4 segments (immediate crisis scene)

### Multiple Vice Management
Characters may have multiple vices but:
- Only one Vice Clock increments per scene (character's choice)
- Other vices generate 1 CP each per scene regardless
- Managing multiple vices requires proportionally more resources

## Campaign Integration

### Mandate Clock Impact
- Each character with Vice Clock at 3+ segments: +1 Mandate
- Represents public sympathy for flawed but effective investigators

### Crisis Clock Impact  
- Each character with Vice Clock at 4 segments: +2 Crisis
- Flawed heroes attract dangerous attention and create complications

### Legacy Conversion
During epilogue, draw 1 Vice card to determine character's long-term fate:
- **Jack/Queen:** Successful management, reduced temptation
- **King:** Ongoing struggle, but learned coping mechanisms
- **Ace:** Complete transformation or tragic end

## Sample Vice Management Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Drinking Detective
**Vice:** King of Spades (Bottle Courage)
**Clock:** 3 segments
**Management:** Player spends 1 Boon per scene to prevent drinking, 2 Boons to attend AA meetings and reduce to 1 segment
**Fallout:** When Boons are unavailable, character shows up drunk to crime scenes, generating CP and professional complications

### Scenario 2: The Obsessive Investigator  
**Vice:** Queen of Hearts (Lover's Betrayal)
**Clock:** 2 segments
**Management:** Player addresses the relationship through roleplay, convincing GM to spend 2 Boons to clear one segment
**Fallout:** Ex-partner becomes informant for antagonists, generating CP through betrayal complications

This system creates ongoing personal tension that drives both mechanical and narrative consequences, perfectly embodying the noir protagonist's eternal struggle with their own darkness.
