A criminal‑campaign module for Fate's Edge: crime families, smugglers, black markets, fences, fixers, and the law that hunts them. Built to sit beside Violets \& Stone (districts), Political Intrigue (faction play), Caravans (smuggling legs), Allies \& Adversaries (crew/org management), Assets \& Patrons, and the core SRD. Uses Position/DV, SB, clocks, Strings, Favor/Leverage/Exposure—no new math.

\section*{What's New in v0.2 (from playtest)}
\begin{itemize}
\item More playbooks: added Fixers and Ward‑Breakers.
\item Heat threshold table: formal Crew/City Heat triggers; Setup SB → Heat/Alarm rule.
\item Overhead tools: Clock Budget (3+1), Heat‑to‑Complication conversion, one‑page Heist Cheat Sheet.
\item Supernatural tie‑ins: Arcane Tier black market, ward crimes, psionic hooks.
\item Long arcs: three campaign frames with milestones.
\item Political mapping: War ↔ Faction clocks, formal Blood‑Silver + Witness settlement.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Quickstart (2 minutes)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a Crew Sheet (§1) and pick a Playbook (Smugglers, Thieves, Enforcers, Grifters, Fixers, Ward‑Breakers). Choose 3 Crew Tags and 2 Strings.
\item Sketch a Turf Map (§2) with 4–6 nodes (districts/venues/routes). Mark 1 Racket you control.
\item Start tracks: Crew Heat [6], City Heat [6], Notoriety [4] (opt.), Law Mandate/Crisis 2/2.
\item Choose an opening Score Type (§6): Heist, Smuggling Run, Protection Play, or Confidence Game.
\item On any 1, GM spends from Shadows \& Steel SB (§9.4). Setup Rule: each SB gained during Setup may either Alarm +1 or Crew Heat +1 (GM picks by fiction).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Crew Sheet (Template)}
\begin{framed}
\noindent \textbf{[CREW NAME]} \\
Type: Smugglers / Thieves / Enforcers / Grifters / Fixers / Ward‑Breakers \\
Tags (choose 3): Riverwise • Locksmiths • Shadow Accounts • Bribe Web • Knives Out • Silver Tongues • Wrecker's Fire • Clean Faces • Ghost Safehouses • Ward Keys • Court Whisper \\
Strings (choose 2): dockmaster favor • tollhouse key • guild fence • customs blind • patrol captain's debt • theater front • lamp‑notary on retainer • ruin‑keeper indulgence \\
Tracks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Crew Heat [6] (recent attention)
\item Notoriety [4] (opt., famous style)
\item Rep [6] (standing underground)
\item Bank (coin abstraction)
\end{itemize}
Allies/Rivals: fixers, fences, patrol captains, rival crews \\
Safehouses/Fronts: names + tags
\end{framed}

\subsection*{Crew Benefits by Type}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Smugglers:} start Riverwise, Customs Blind; once/leg, Smuggle DV –1.
\item \textbf{Thieves:} start Locksmiths, Clean Faces; once/score, Infiltrate Position +1.
\item \textbf{Enforcers:} start Knives Out, Wrecker's Fire; once/score, Intimidate/Break Effect +1.
\item \textbf{Grifters:} start Silver Tongues, Shadow Accounts; once/score, convert Audience: Cool → Warm.
\item \textbf{Fixers (NEW):} start Bribe Web, Court Whisper; once/score, treat Petition/Broker DV –1 in courts/markets.
\item \textbf{Ward‑Breakers (NEW):} start Ward Keys, Ghost Safehouses; once/score, ignore first Desperate from wards/psionic weather.
\end{itemize}

\section{Turf Map \& Territory Control}
Turf Map: Draw 4–6 nodes: Districts (e.g., Dye Yards, Pilots' Quays), Venues (Moon Market, Gambling Row), Pipelines (river cut, sewer run, postern stairs). Connect with arrows that show movement/contraband flow.

\subsection*{Rackets:} gambling den • dice house • ropewalk skims • dock tithe • counterfeit inks • lanternhouses • fighting pits • lockshop chain • locker barge • eel‑channel • ward‑glass salvage (NEW) • oath‑lamp forgery (NEW).

\subsection*{Taking Turf:} create Claim [6] on a node. During scores aimed at this node, strong outcomes tick Claim. When it fills, add the racket and a String (front or bribe web). Mark Crew Heat +1.

\subsection*{Holding Turf:} each session, roll Hold (Wits+Tactics) vs DV 2–4 by pressure. On hit, gain Bank +1 or Audience: Warm in that node. On 1s, advance a Trouble [4] for that turf (rivals, inspectors, unions).

\subsection*{Territory War:} When rivals contest, start War [8]. While War>0, Bandwidth –1 between sessions. Settlement Template: pay Blood‑Silver (2 Bank each) + name a Witness Faction; all parties stake a Lamp‑Oath [4]. Breaking it: Exposure +1, Repute –1 with the witness faction, War resumes at 2/8.

\section{Heat, Law, and Crackdowns}
\subsection*{Crew Heat [6] thresholds}
\begin{itemize}
\item 0–2: background hum.
\item 3: start Patrol Sweep [4].
\item 4–5: random stops; Notoriety +1 when you make a flashy move.
\item 6: trigger Sting [6] and Exposure +1.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{City Heat [6] thresholds}
\begin{itemize}
\item 0–2: routine.
\item 3: curfew murmurs, stop‑and‑search; start Patrol Sweep [4] in hot districts.
\item 6: Crackdown [4] (DV +1 on criminal actions, law starts with Audience: Hostile).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cooling Actions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lay Low:} lose 1 Bandwidth; clear Crew Heat –2; gain Notoriety +1 (opt.).
\item \textbf{Grease Palms:} spend Bank/Favor; clear Crew Heat –1 and one Inspection.
\item \textbf{Hard Pivot:} burn a front (lose one racket) to clear Crew Heat –3 and City Heat –1.
\end{itemize}

Law Tools: Riverine Patrol, City Watch, Tax Assessor, Bridge Guards—each tracks a Sting [6].

\section{Black Markets \& Rare Goods}
Use Market from Caravans.

\subsection*{Tiers \& DV:} Street DV 2–3 • Guild DV 3–4 • Court DV 4–5 • Arcane (NEW) DV 5 (wards, psionic keys, oath‑lamps). \\

\subsection*{Partials:} price spike (Bank –1) • Crew Heat +1 • quality flaw (–1 Effect next use) • seller's Temp String • Inspection [4] starts. \\
\textbf{Miss:} sting springs (Sting [6] +2), counterfeit, or owed favor to a rival fence. \\
\textbf{Laundering:} Broker/Account DV 3–4. On hit, convert Hot → Clean; on 1, City Heat +1.

Use: pay Price for Clue +1, small String, or DV –1 in their sphere. On 1s, Reliability –1. At 0, they flip or vanish; start Burn [4] to recover/replace.

\subsection*{Moves (NEW):}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cross‑Check:} spend 2 informants on same topic → take +1 Effect and only the lowest Reliability –1 applies on a 1.
\item \textbf{Mask a Source:} spend Bank 1 to prevent Reliability –1 once.
\end{itemize}

\section{Score Types \& Heist Planner}

\subsection*{Heist Planner (lightweight)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Objective \& Venue.

\item Threat Clocks: Alarm [4–6], Patrol Routes [4], Inside Man [4].
\item Flashbacks (opt.) at cost (Bank/Favor/Heat).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Kit Tokens (NEW):} start each score with 2; spend to declare plausible gear or a small contact. Each extra beyond 2 adds Crew Heat +1.
