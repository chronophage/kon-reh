    {\LARGE \textbf{Fantasy City Expansion: Violets \& Stone}} \\
    {\large (Fate’s Edge v0.2)} \\
    \vspace{0.5em}
    A plug-and-play urban module for Fate’s Edge campaigns set among bridges, aqueducts, rites, caravans, and crown politics.
\end{center}

\sectionrule

\section*{Design Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item City as character. Districts and institutions carry tags, strings, and clocks that push back.
    \item Plug into core. Use Position/DV, SB, and clocks; no new dice math.
    \item Street to state. Blend casework, capers, and civic settlements.
    \item Low bookkeeping. Track names and tags; let clocks and strings carry weight.
\end{itemize}

\sectionrule

\section*{Quickstart (2 minutes)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pick a City Kit (§7). Set Mandate 2 / Crisis 2 unless fiction says otherwise.
    \item Choose 4 Factions from the kit; copy their Strings; start Influence [6] / Stability [6–8] / Exposure [6].
    \item Mark 2 volatile stakes on the relationship map.
    \item Draw the Urban Deck (§6.2): one Incident (Spade), one Person (Heart), one Complication (Club) to spark the opening dilemma.
    \item Frame the first Situation Clock [4–8] and at least one Counter-Clock [4–6].
    \item Play scenes. All 1s generate SB; spend city-flavored Social SB (§3.4).
\end{enumerate}

\sectionrule
