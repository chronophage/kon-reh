\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section*{Core Concept}
The Lethai are divided by an ancient curse that prevents them from fully accessing both physical and mental gifts. This division creates distinct elven cultures, each excelling in different aspects of existence while yearning for wholeness. They are masters of living law, environmental stewardship, and contextual knowledge.

\section*{Affinity (All Lethai)}
\textbf{Gift of the Body OR Gift of the Mind (Choose One):}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Gift of the Body (Lethai-al/ar):} +1 die to physical actions (Body-based skills). Once per scene, can spend 1 Boon to enhance a physical ability beyond normal limits for one action.
  \item \textbf{Gift of the Mind (Lethai-thora):} +1 die to mental actions (Wits/Spirit-based skills). Once per scene, can spend 1 Boon to recall or deduce information that would normally be beyond immediate knowledge.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Curse of Division:} Lethai cannot take talents that enhance both physical and mental capabilities simultaneously. If a talent would grant bonuses to both, choose one benefit.

\section{Lethai-al — Root, River, and the Roof-Tree}

\subsection*{Woodwise lawkeepers, merchants of light and shade, and stewards of living borders}

\begin{quote}
``Name yourself once, name the river twice, and never name the forest as if it were yours.''
\end{quote}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{I. Ground \& Memory}

The Lethai-al dwell where roof-trees braid the sky and rivers think aloud. Their memory is arboreal: rings and seasons, storms and healings, disputes recorded in coppice and replanting rather than tablets and seals. A Lethai-al oath is \textbf{root-law}: it binds living things—people, paths, waters—and is paid in years. To outsiders they appear quiet; to neighbors they are relentless auditors of footprint and flow.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{II. Forest Commons (Places that Hold)}

\subsubsection*{Valewood}
Tall-canopy forest stitched with rain gardens and stone-steps. Trails shift by season; waystones carry moss-tallies (green for open, gray for mend, black for trespass). Songs mark crossings where words would bruise the undergrowth.

\subsubsection*{Roof-Tree Circles}
Villages built around elders: one monumental tree per circle, scaffolded with walkways and rain-catchers. Roof-Tree sap is consecrated—used to seal pacts and to dismiss them when harms outweigh promises.

\subsubsection*{River Courts}
Every significant stream keeps a court: a shingle bank, a willow-bench, a book of pebbles. Trade, ferry rights, and flood work are judged where the water can overhear.

\subsubsection*{Edge-Wards}
Where wood meets field or steppe, boundary groves are tended as treaties: thorn, ash, and fruit interplanted. The sharp feeds the soft—hedge law that stops hooves and nourishes neighbors.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{III. Courtesy \& Everyday Law}

\textbf{Shade Etiquette} is the grammar of Lethai-al life. Observing it grants hospitality and hearing; ignoring it turns the forest against your plans.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Iron Covered.} Bare iron offends ward-lines; wrap it in leather or cloth. (Mechanic: on first entry, covered iron grants \emph{Position +1} in any parley or request to pass.)
  \item \textbf{Name Once.} Speak your name and intent at the edge; do not name the forest as property.
  \item \textbf{Step on Stone.} Where stones are laid, use them; every crushed sprout is a debt.
  \item \textbf{Water First.} Pour a first cup to the river or cistern before you drink.
  \item \textbf{Leave the Light.} Replace the shade you take: plant, mend, or pay. (Use \emph{Light-Due Strings} below.)
\end{itemize}

\textit{Clocks for breaches:} \textbf{Under-Root Grudge [4]}, \textbf{Stream-Clouding [4]}. When a clock fills, expect formal censure, raised tariffs, or wardens on the path.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{IV. Courts \& Factions (Not One Voice)}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Wardens of the Roof-Tree.} Rangers and surveyors who measure canopy health, poacher pressure, and firebreaks. They carry leaf-badges and thorn-writs.
  \item \textbf{Merchant Foresters (Syndics of Light).} Manage sustainable fellings, resin trade, boat-timber quotas, and lantern-wood auctions. They argue that trade funds stewardship.
  \item \textbf{Songkeepers.} Priests of repair rites and remembrance festivals. They arbitrate forgiveness by counting regrowth, not coin.
  \item \textbf{Ferrymen of the Rain.} River pilots and dam-tenders; their votes swing courts in flood years.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Tension lines:} quota vs. canopy; export timbers vs. local craft; river straightening for mills vs. flood meadows for salmon.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{V. Borders \& Neighbors}

\subsubsection*{Silence Furlong (with the Ykrul)}
A speechless border strip: no grazing, no felling, no names. Cross in silence, then speak once. Honored, it keeps peace warm; broken, gray-fletched messengers appear at dusk. Joint patrols mend hedges and lift stones; concessions are marked as seasonal strings on both boards.

\subsubsection*{Ridge Courtesy (with the Aeler)}
Root-law and stone-law trade proofs. Aeler build keystone stairs where Lethai-al choose the line; Lethai-al plant edge-wards that keep roads alive. Disputes end with bread in oven courts and sap at roof-trees.

\subsubsection*{Moots at the Mouth (with the Linns)}
Ship-timber quotas bind with replanting moots and harbor dues. When storm seasons bite, both sides sing the river clear.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{VI. Economy of Light (Strings \& Ledgers)}

Light and shade are currencies. Every fell, ferry, and fire has a \textbf{light-due}—a balance to be repaid in replanting, canal-clearing, or trade at kinder rates.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Strings (examples):} \emph{light-due receipt}; \emph{shade-credit}; \emph{ferry right}; \emph{resin share}; \emph{canoe-lane priority}; \emph{seed tithe}.
  \item \textbf{Use:} Cash a light-due to gain \emph{DV --1} on any operation framed as repair, replanting, or flood work. Abuse it and start \emph{Under-Root Grudge [1]}.
  \item \textbf{Quotas as Clocks:} \emph{Boat-Timber Quota [6]}, \emph{Lanternwood Allotment [4]}. Fill the clock to unlock export; overfill and trigger \emph{Canopy Censure}.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{VII. Threats \& Remedies}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Bark Blight.} A fungal rot spread by careless carts and damp blades. Remedy: ash-wash stations, tool quarantine, fire-lines by moon.
  \item \textbf{Poacher Pressure.} Syndicates take ripe resin and seedwood without dues. Remedy: undercover ferries; tariff traps at market; public shaming rites.
  \item \textbf{River Clouding.} Silt from mills and bad embankments chokes fish beds. Remedy: settle-ponds, scheduled sluices, mill-weirs redesigned with Aeler math.
  \item \textbf{Old Fire.} Lightning scars that wake in drought years. Remedy: fuel mosaics, controlled burns, ember patrols.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Fronts (example):} \textbf{Bark Blight [6]} → \textbf{Canopy Hunger [4]} → \textbf{Famine Tariff [4]}.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{VIII. Tools \& Tokens (at the table)}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Leaf-Badge (Warden).} Once/scene, upgrade Position by +1 when enforcing forest law or rescue.
  \item \textbf{Seed-Tithe Seal.} Convert a sanction into a \emph{Repair Project [4]} instead of a fine or exile.
  \item \textbf{Ferry-Knot.} Skip the first \emph{River Hazard} consequence on a leg or chase; on use, pay a \emph{light-due}.
  \item \textbf{Moss-Tally.} Reveal one hidden quota clock in a market or lumberyard scene.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{IX. Aesthetics \& Speech}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Materials:} bark-laminate armor, willow-bone frames, resin-glass panes, river-iron sheathed in leather.
  \item \textbf{Colors:} rain green, bark gray, amber, sky-through-leaf.
  \item \textbf{Proverbs:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item ``Leave the forest no thinner than your shadow.''
      \item ``The river remembers who spoke over it and what they promised.''
      \item ``Cut where it wants to fall or do not cut at all.''
      \item ``If the hedge is hungry, the treaty is thin.''
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Names:} given + grove + season/deed: \emph{Talan of Reedfall, Who Unknotted the Flood}.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{X. Integration Hooks}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Political Intrigue:} Forest syndics lobby city councils for lanternwood allotments; bribes look like “donations” to flood work.
  \item \textbf{Caravans:} Resin and seed routes require \emph{shade-credit}; escorts must mind iron covers and Silence Furlongs.
  \item \textbf{Wilderness:} Use \emph{Hinterlands} procedures with \emph{fuel mosaics} and \emph{blight quarantine} as special orders.
  \item \textbf{Violets \& Stone:} Dock courts host River Days; Lethai-al ferries grant \emph{canoe-lane priority} to crews who mend ladders and steps.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{XI. Adventure Seeds}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{The Hedge That Ate a Road.} An edge-ward grew too well and swallowed a toll lane. Broker a cut and a replanting that keeps both law and trade.
  \item \textbf{Blight Under Boots.} Bark Blight rides a caravan’s wheel hubs. Build ash-wash stations without sparking a tariff war.
  \item \textbf{Silence Furlong, Twice Broken.} Two violations in one season risk a border feud. Walk the strip, plant the apology, and write a geometry both sides can live in.
  \item \textbf{River Court at Flood.} Mills want straighter banks; fishers want flood meadows; Aeler offer weirs. Choose a design, then stand in the water and defend it.
  \item \textbf{Lanternwood Ledger.} A stenographer vanished with the quota book before an export moot. Find them, or reconstruct the truth from moss tallies and ferry knots.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{XII. Portraying the Lethai-al}

Let \emph{policy} speak before mystique: quotas, ferries, hedges, and the cost of light. Make courtesy concrete (stones, coverings, cups) and consequences seasonal, not theatrical. Honor the forest as a \emph{party to the treaty}, not scenery. When in doubt, ask: \emph{What did this footstep cost, and who will we pay?}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{XIII. Language \& Time (Context is King)}

Lethai speech is \textbf{context-saturated}. Syntax legible to grandparents will baffle grandchildren unless framed by the right place, season, and kinship. Meaning travels with \emph{context keys}—gesture, setting, shared story. A sentence lifted from its grove can die on the road.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Context Keys.} Place-name, season-mark, kinship-hand, and roof-tree sign. Absent any two, assume misreadings.
  \item \textbf{Old Texts.} Manuscripts older than two generations require \emph{gloss-trees} (marginal twig glyphs) or a \emph{songkeeper} to render.
  \item \textbf{In play.} When reading or pleading in older registers, increase DV by +1 unless the party holds a \emph{Context String} (gloss-tree, witness, song). Cashing a Context String reduces DV by --1 and creates a \emph{Shared Frame} for the scene (Position +1 on first exchange).
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{XIV. Peoples \& Lineages (Not One Grove)}

\paragraph{Lethai-al — \emph{The People of the Body}} 
The woodwise many. Found in most great forests, they are the elves most humans meet and the most willing to integrate in mixed cities. \textbf{Embodied and present}: heightened senses, quick strength, an ease with weather and work. Most \emph{half-elves} trace lineage here.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Everyday.} Ferry crews, hedge-wardens, resin syndics, ward dancers.
  \item \textbf{Gifts (examples).} \emph{Canopy Spring} (Position +1 on leaps/climbs once/scene); \emph{Scent of Rain} (clue on approaching weather/rot); \emph{Root-Balance} (resist shove/knockdown).
  \item \textbf{Strings.} ferry knot; resin share; roof-tree blessing.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Lethai-ar — \emph{The Oathbound (Dark Elves)}} 
Wood elves who swear to \textbf{Inae} (the Weaver, Angel of Spiders) or \textbf{Isoka} (the Serpent Queen, Angel of Snakes). Rare in the upper Amaranthine, growing along shaded trade arteries and cavernous underways. Their vows shape craft and law: webs of obligation, clean strikes, poison as \emph{medicine with teeth}.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Everyday.} Understory judges, silk engineers, antidote keepers, night pilots.
  \item \textbf{Gifts (examples).} \emph{Weaver’s Reading} (trace networks: DV --1 on uncovering plots/paths); \emph{Stillness} (be unnoticed in dim light until you move to act); \emph{Venin Lore} (convert Harm 1 from toxins to Fatigue once/scene).
  \item \textbf{Strings.} spider-vow token; serpent oath; silk-tithe.
  \item \textbf{Courtesy.} Oath-signs worn openly; breaking web-law costs \emph{Mask Rights} for a season.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Lethai-thora — \emph{The People of the Mind}} 
Urban circles, chiefly in \textbf{Thepyrgos}. Scholars, civil engineers, translators of other peoples’ law. \textbf{Long memories, sharp minds}; ironically, many are experts on human and Aeler culture. Their courts weigh arguments like bridges.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Everyday.} Archivists, canal designers, mint auditors, diplomatic tutors.
  \item \textbf{Gifts (examples).} \emph{Memory Canticle} (recall a text with line-accurate detail); \emph{Number Music} (DV --1 on design/repair/logistics projects framed aloud); \emph{Cold Reading} (Position +1 on first parley when you had time to observe).
  \item \textbf{Strings.} gloss-tree charter; canal seal; ledger witness.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Sundered Elves (Itinerant Thora)} 
Lethai-thora who reject the bench for the road. They carry portable gloss-trees and teach \emph{context literacy} in market towns. Neither fully grove nor fully court, they translate between.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Gifts (examples).} \emph{Bridge-Tongue} (treat cross-cultural etiquette DV as if in shared frame once/scene); \emph{Pocket Gloss} (create a one-use Context String on the fly).
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{XV. The Two Gifts (Body \& Mind) \& Mixed Blood}

Lethai tradition holds: \textbf{no one may bear both gifts} at once. A person chooses (or is chosen by) \emph{Body} (Lethai-al, Lethai-ar) \emph{or} \emph{Mind} (Lethai-thora). Training and rites reinforce the choice; law and courtesy expect it.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Rule of the Two Gifts.} A Lethai PC selects either \emph{Body} or \emph{Mind} at character creation; pick Gifts only from that list. Swapping lists requires a season-long project and comes with social costs (lose one String tied to the former gift).
  \item \textbf{Half-Elf Exception.} A half-elf whose heritage is \emph{quartered} (one quarter Lethai-al or -ar; one quarter Lethai-thora; remainder human or other) may take \emph{one} Body Gift and \emph{one} Mind Gift. This \textbf{Bridge-Born Clause} is rare and often controversial.
  \item \textbf{Most Half-Elves.} Most half-elves in mixed cities descend from Lethai-al lines; they default to Body Gifts unless the Bridge-Born Clause applies.
\end{itemize}

\textit{In play.} The Two Gifts are \emph{narrative permissions}: Body Gifts tend to grant Position shifts and physical resistances; Mind Gifts lean toward DV reduction in planning, repair, and rhetoric. Do not add new math—use core ladders.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{XVI. Hooks \& Complications}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{The Gloss That Wouldn’t Read.} A treaty text from three generations back refuses to make sense. Find the missing context keys or watch a border go hot.
  \item \textbf{Web-Law, River-Law.} Lethai-ar silk syndics claim a bridge-toll by Inae’s charter; Lethai-thora auditors counter with canal clauses. Bowl, then Board, then \emph{Shade Etiquette}.
  \item \textbf{Bridge-Born in Question.} A half-elf prodigy manifests both gifts; a circle moves to forbid the rite. Protect or persuade before the masks come down.
  \item \textbf{Mask Rights Forfeit.} A serpent oath-bearer allegedly broke web-law in human courts; can a seed-tithe seal commute sanction to a repair project?
  \item \textbf{The Sundered’s Lesson.} A Sundered gloss-carrier teaches a market to read Lethai context—someone powerful profits from the confusion and wants them gone.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{XVII. Rivals \& Distance: Aeler and Ykrul}

\subsubsection*{With the Aeler (Stone-Law, Root-Law)}
The quarrel is old and mostly quiet: \textbf{stone-law} tallies weight and span; \textbf{root-law} tallies shade and years. Each doubts the other’s ledgers. Aeler keystone stairs bite deep; Lethai-al prefer lines that bend with slope and sap. They trade proofs—bridges that do not drown salmon, hedges that do not choke roads—and keep their councils separate when tempers rise. The Aeler call elves the "Aelaef"

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Treaties in Practice.} \emph{Keystone-in-Bark} accords mark where a road enters a grove: the Aeler choose the tread, the Lethai choose the line. Breaking either creates fines paid as \emph{repair years}.
  \item \textbf{Isolation Habits.} Pass-keeps that only ring bells to one side; roof-tree circles that refuse iron even when wrapped. Delegations meet at \emph{split courts}—half oven, half river bank—and adjourn before dusk.
  \item \textbf{Strings.} keystone courtesy; shade-credit; river-weir writ; seed-tithe seal.
  \item \textbf{Clocks.} \textbf{Ridge–Root Stalemate [4]} (project stalls until a mixed design is signed); \textbf{Sluice vs. Salmon [4]} (silt, tariffs, tempers).
  \item \textbf{Levers at the Table.} If a scene honors both \emph{iron-covered} and \emph{step-on-stone}, begin in a \emph{Shared Frame} (Position +1 on the first exchange). If either party arrives with bare iron or cuts outside plan, advance \emph{Ridge–Root Stalemate} by +1.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{With the Ykrul (Grass-Law, Shade-Law)}
Respect edged into distance. The \textbf{Silence Furlong} keeps hooves from roots and axes from borders: cross wordless, name yourself once, and keep to the stones. When honored, councils run warm; when broken twice in a season, gray-fletched messengers appear at dusk and rings draw tight.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Customs.} \emph{Bowl, Board, and Shade}—fairness, then geometry, then courtesy; a concession on the Ykrul board becomes a seasonal \emph{light-due} at the forest edge.
  \item \textbf{Isolation Habits.} Markets on the margin (hedge fairs) rather than deep exchange; joint patrols that mend hedges together but camp apart; songs traded by echo, not chorus.
  \item \textbf{Strings.} light-due receipt; ferry knot; windbreak right; border-song.
  \item \textbf{Clocks.} \textbf{Furlong Breach [4]} (speech, grazing, or felling in the strip); \textbf{Banner at the Hedge [3]} (Meadow banners crowd the edge; tempers tighten).
  \item \textbf{Levers at the Table.} When both sides keep the Furlong and the \emph{iron-covered} rule, reduce DV by --1 on any parley for passage or pasture. On a breach, increase DV by +1 and tick \emph{Furlong Breach}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Notes for Portrayal}
Keep rivalry \emph{policy-first}: quotas, stairs, hedges, ferries, and the cost of light—rather than eternal enmity. Isolation is a choice with reasons: fewer misunderstandings, slower trade, less shared risk. Let dissenters exist on both sides (Aeler reform lodges; Lethai merchant foresters) who argue for \emph{mixed councils} where ovens, weirs, and hedges share one ledger.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{XVIII. War by Shade — Deterrence \& Asymmetry}

The Lethai-al and Lethai-ar do not meet banners in open fields. They make \emph{routes expensive}, fragment columns, and end campaigns by ledger long before the first arrow. This doctrine—called \textbf{war by shade}—is why most peoples simply leave the forests alone.

\paragraph{Principles}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Fight the route, not the regiment.} Break ferries, confuse lanes, erase way-marks, and make supply walk twice.
  \item \textbf{One strike, five repairs.} Every cut obligates replanting or flood-work; war ends when the ledger of repair is signed.
  \item \textbf{Night, rain, understory.} Engage when wind and water cover sound; withdraw where canopy eats pursuit.
  \item \textbf{Courtesy as weapon.} An iron uncovered or a crushed sprout is grounds to raise tariffs, close ferries, or call wardens without drawing a blade.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Plays of the Shade}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Hedge War.} Edge-wards are cut and reknit to channel intruders into \emph{dead ground} pockets watched by wardens. (Invader \emph{Move/Scout} DV +1 while \emph{Hedge Mosaic} stands.)
  \item \textbf{River Denial.} Ferries vanish upstream; weirs open at dusk; mills idle to clear silt where pursuers need footing. (Start \emph{Supply Strangle [4]} on any hostile force dependent on crossings.)
  \item \textbf{Night Lanes.} Lethai-ar \emph{web-law} lays silk trip-lines and warning strings; Inae’s oath-bearers strike once and vanish; Isoka’s keepers use venin as medicine with teeth. (First ambush in dim light begins at \emph{Dominant} for defenders; on hit, intruders mark \emph{Fatigue} instead of direct Harm unless they stand and escalate.)
  \item \textbf{Canopy Runners.} Lethai-al move above sight-lines; arrows fall where footfalls never were. (Once/scene, defenders convert a \emph{pursuit} into a \emph{parley or retreat} with \emph{Position +1}.)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Deterrence, in Practice}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Fearsome Reputation.} Before any faction chooses a forest campaign, start \textbf{“Leave Them Alone” [2]}. On fill, leaders choose tariff, treaty, or route-around over invasion.
  \item \textbf{Intruder Exhaustion [6].} Ticks for lost hours, wet powder, spoiled grain, and wrong turns. On fill, morale folds without a decisive battle.
  \item \textbf{Arrow Ethics [3].} Songkeepers oversee. If intruders withdraw and sign repairs, arrows go quiet. If they burn, the mask rights come down and ambushes escalate.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Terrain Tags (at the table)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Hedge Mosaic.} Invaders suffer DV +1 on Navigate/Scout; first defender action gains \emph{Position +1}.
  \item \textbf{Resin Smoke.} On ignition, obscure vision and sting eyes; convert first Ranged Harm 1 against defenders to \emph{Fatigue}.
  \item \textbf{Stone Steps.} If invaders \emph{step on stone} and keep iron covered, begin in a \emph{Shared Frame} (DV --1 to request safe passage). Breaches tick \emph{Under-Root Grudge}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Why Most Leave Them Alone}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Campaigns end in tariffs and repair years, not trophies—no glory to sell at court.
  \item Columns starve by inches while ledgers fatten with fines and ferry dues.
  \item Past nights have names (\emph{Two Bridges Gone, The River That Walked}); generals remember.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Hooks}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Five Cuts, One Bridge.} A hedge war strands a foreign regiment. Negotiate the repair ledger before someone lights the resin stores.
  \item \textbf{Web \& Weir.} Lethai-ar silk lines are blamed for a drowned patrol; River Denial saved three villages. Untangle oath from accident before \emph{Leave Them Alone} collapses to \emph{Banner at the Hedge}.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\textbf{Context-Saturated Speech:} Lethai language evolves rapidly. Reading texts older than two generations requires successful Lore + Notice (DV 4-5) or a Context String. Speaking in older registers without proper context keys increases DV by +1.

\begin{center}
  {\LARGE Lethai-ar — The Vowed in Silk and Scale}
  
  \bigskip
  {\large ``Speak truth twice, whisper once; tie what you mean.''}
  \end{center}
  
  The Lethai-ar are not a separate bloodline so much as a vow. They are Lethai-al (the People of the Body, ``wood-elves'') who have sworn themselves to one of two ancient powers of the threshold: Inae, the Weaver (threads, mercy, binding context) or Isoka, the Serpent Queen (shedding, cunning, the price of cure). In some ages they are scarce, in others—like the present—their numbers grow wherever borders fray and oaths need teeth.
  
  They are the elves most other peoples prefer not to cross at night.
  
  \bigskip
  
  \textbf{Where They Live}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Edge-Forests \& Gloam Holds.} Rope-bridged canopy towns with silk wind-screens, scent-coded paths, and night gardens. On the valley floor: stone ``molt courts'' where the old is shed and sealed.
  \item \textbf{Under-Vales \& Rootways.} Knot-mapped tunnels, mirror-trick chambers, and pool-shrines where whispers travel farther than footsteps.
  \item \textbf{Port Enclaves.} Lantern-draped alleys near customs houses: contract brokers, poison-cure apothecaries, and ``mask-right'' parlors where parley is held under silk.
  \end{itemize}
  
  They're rare north of the Upper Amaranthine, but cells are appearing along caravan routes and siege lines—wherever a binding needs mercy or a lie needs a price.
  
  \bigskip
  
  \textbf{The Vows (Two Courts, One Edge)}
  
  \textbf{The Silk Courts of Inae (Weaver)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Temper:} mercy with memory; the knot that mends rather than strangles.
  \item \textbf{Work:} draft and enforce multi-party compacts; rebuild frayed custom; hide the vulnerable in plain sight.
  \item \textbf{Signs:} three-strand cords, ledger-ribbons, masks with tear-slits.
  \item \textbf{Law:} Two ledgers, Said \& Meant, tied together with a visible clause.
  \item \textbf{Sin:} binding without consent; mending that erases the harmed.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{The Coil Courts of Isoka (Serpent)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Temper:} cunning without needless cruelty; harm that carries its own cure.
  \item \textbf{Work:} expose weak seams; stage molts (identity exits) for those trapped; weaponize patience.
  \item \textbf{Signs:} shed-skin sashes, cup-and-vial pairs, scalpels wrapped in green thread.
  \item \textbf{Law:} every poison must be paired with a cure somewhere the oath-holder can reach.
  \item \textbf{Sin:} a wound with no offered remedy; a molt forced by shame.
  \end{itemize}
  
  Together: Inae binds the room to meaning; Isoka frees the person from traps. Lethai-ar make both moves feel like one motion.
  
  \bigskip
  
  \textbf{Language, Marks, and Memory}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Context-Locked Speech.} Elven is so contextual that two generations can't read each other cleanly. Lethai-ar solve this with marks (tattoo/ink/scar/silk beadwork) that carry context—names of witnesses, seasons, and prices—on the body.
  \item \textbf{Marks → Curses.} A mark without its living story curdles: a ``Hunter's Night'' becomes sleeplessness; a ``Mercy Knot'' becomes compulsion. The Lethai-ar curate and retire marks like hazardous heirlooms.
  \item \textbf{Artifact Burdens.} Many sacred tools (masks, cords, vials) store cultural knowledge. Lethai-ar treat them like ledgers: if the story breaks, so does the tool's kindness.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \bigskip
  
  \textbf{Body and Mind (The Unmixed Gifts)}
  
  Lethai tradition holds that no Lethai can carry the full ``Gift of Body'' and ``Gift of Mind'' together; the Lethai-ar, sworn from the body-gifted Lethai-al, emphasize embodied presence, heightened senses, and discipline, wielding mind by way of context (marks, contracts, etiquette), not raw cognition.
  
  Rare mixed-heritage kin (a ``quarter of each'') can bridge the gifts—objects of both hope and unease in Lethai-ar courts.
  
  \bigskip
  
  \textbf{Etiquette \& Rites (How to Survive Their Parlors)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mask-Right.} Serious parley is held under silk; roles and intentions are declared, then the mask goes on. Break mask-right and you will not be heard again that season.
  \item \textbf{Speak Twice, Whisper Once.} State the truth two ways; then the price as a whisper to the witness. If you can't name the price, you don't understand your own request.
  \item \textbf{Thread Before Blade.} Offer a binding solution first. If steel must speak, it speaks where a thread was refused.
  \item \textbf{Vial Courtesy.} In Isoka's houses, a dose sits beside its antidote. Taking one without the other marks you as untrustworthy.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \bigskip
  
  \textbf{War Without Battle (Doctrine)}
  
  The Lethai-ar are the textbook on asymmetric warfare:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Silence Corridors.} Silence furlongs across borders: no grazing, no felling, no names. Violations turn your scout signs against you.
  \item \textbf{Ambush as Audit.} They treat logistics like law—cut one keystone (a ferry, a ridge path) and make you pay repair years under witness.
  \item \textbf{Fear Economy.} Their reputation buys exits before arrows. Most armies learn to avoid ``black ribbon nights,'' when coils and webs both shift.
  \item \textbf{Night Doctrine.} Lamp placements create ``honor lanes'' where even pursuers must slow. They kill lights, not people—unless you force the price.
  \end{itemize}
  
  Most peoples leave them alone; those who don't tend to meet a contract they wish had been a skirmish.
  
  \bigskip
  
  \textbf{Neighbors \& Borders}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ykrul:} Mutual distance, ritual respect. Border treaties often include a speechless strip and a joint ``Bowl \& Board'' at season's end. Ykrul price routes; Lethai-ar price behavior.
  \item \textbf{Aeler:} Underway adjacency breeds friction. Aeler bring breath-time and beams; Lethai-ar bring mask-right and mercy-knots. Both enforce oaths; they disagree about who writes the receipt.
  \item \textbf{Lethai-al / Lethai-thora:} The Lethai-ar recruit from the al; they contest with the thora over who defines ``context.'' Sundered thora wanderers sometimes find refuge under coil or web.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \bigskip
  
  \textbf{Economy \& Everyday}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Web-Law Brokerage.} Multi-party deals that hold even across language drift.
  \item \textbf{Poison-Cure Houses.} Venoms for cutting cruelty short; antidotes for those who choose return.
  \item \textbf{Night Markets.} Silk-screened stalls that sell contexts: a role, a mask, a witness-for-hire who'll remember what you meant.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \bigskip
  
  \textbf{What They Believe They're For}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item To bind harm so it cannot spread.
  \item To cut traps that call themselves tradition.
  \item To carry context so tomorrow's children won't inherit our mistakes as their curses.
  \end{itemize}
  
  They will tell you, if you ask in the right room: ``We are the price you pay to keep meaning.''
  
  \bigskip
  
  \textbf{Frictions \& Story Heat}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Marks Going Bad.} A famous mark has lost its last living witness; now it behaves like a curse. Do you retire it—or repair the story it needs?
  \item \textbf{Mask-Right vs. Under-Beam.} Aeler want a dispute under a single lamp (witness law). Lethai-ar demand silk (role law). Which threshold rules?
  \item \textbf{Snake's Mercy.} A tyrant's guard captain begs a molt (new life) after unspeakable work. The cure exists—who pays for it?
  \item \textbf{Thread in the Steppe.} A silence furlong through Ykrul pasture is broken; wolves and politics arrive together. Re-stitch the corridor or accept a border that now bites.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \bigskip
  
  \textbf{How to Portray Them (at the table)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Embodied calm.} Even at war, they stand like dancers waiting for the beat.
  \item \textbf{Context first.} Every request has a price, every truth needs a witness, every blade wants a thread it can't cut.
  \item \textbf{Mercy with edge.} They save people by binding situations—and they do it with the precision of surgeons, not saints.
  \end{itemize}
  
  The Lethai-ar are the elves you negotiate with if you're wise—and fight only if you enjoy losing to rules you didn't bother to learn.
  
\subsection{XIX. Marks — Burden, Blessing, and Lost Context}

Many Lethai artifacts carry \textbf{inherited knowing}. Leafblades etched with moss-tallies, resin-glass panels that hold songs, riverstones scored by ferrymen—these do not merely \emph{remember}; they \emph{obligate}. Among the Lethai—especially the woodwise Lethai-al—\textbf{past knowledge is a burden on the present}. What you inherit, you must carry carefully or set down with witness.

\paragraph{Passing-Knowledge Artifacts}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Leafblade (moss-tallied).} A knife whose edge carries hedge-law. \emph{Invoke:} gain a \emph{Context String} for border disputes; \emph{Cost:} tick \textbf{Burden Ledger [1]} (you owe repair work this season).
  \item \textbf{Resin-Glass Pane.} Sun-cured panels that hold a chorus. \emph{Invoke:} reduce DV by --1 on rites requiring the old wording; \emph{Cost:} \emph{Under-Root Grudge} +1 if used to excuse harm without replanting.
  \item \textbf{Riverstone Book.} Pebbles in corded order record ferry rights. \emph{Invoke:} create a temporary \emph{Ferry Knot String}; \emph{Cost:} pay \emph{light-due} before you drink.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Marks of the Body (Animist Rites)}
Lethai \textbf{Marks} (ink, scar, resin-inlay) amplify embodied gifts by binding person to pattern. Every Mark has \emph{Context Keys}—place, season, witness. \textbf{Out of context, a Mark drifts toward curse.}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Barkskin Mark.} Skin takes the grain of oak. \emph{Gift:} once/scene, downgrade a Physical Harm by one step (\emph{Position +1} when braced). \emph{Context Keys:} shaded work, sap rite, roof-tree witness. \emph{Curse (lost context):} brittleness—cold converts first Fatigue to Harm.
  \item \textbf{River-Ears.} Cartilage braided with silver reed. \emph{Gift:} sense current/voices across water (Clue +1 on rivers). \emph{Keys:} pour water first, ferryman’s knot. \emph{Curse:} flood-whispers—compelled toward lowest ground (SB: \emph{Downhill Pull}).
  \item \textbf{Spider’s Patience} (Inae oath). \emph{Gift:} hold still beyond breath; ambush begins at \emph{Dominant} in dim light. \emph{Keys:} web-tithe, oath-sign shown. \emph{Curse:} fixation—DV +1 to abandon a plan once set.
  \item \textbf{Serpent’s Breath} (Isoka oath). \emph{Gift:} once/scene convert Toxin Harm 1 to Fatigue; read heat like color. \emph{Keys:} antivenin rite, shed-skin offering. \emph{Curse:} cold-blooded—action slows in chill (Position --1 unless warmed).
  \item \textbf{Storm-Shadow.} Ink of ash and rain. \emph{Gift:} vanish in downpour; ranged attacks vs. you suffer --1 Effect in rain. \emph{Keys:} storm cup, gutter song. \emph{Curse:} thunder-call—loud noises pull attention (start \emph{Noticed [1]} on loud scenes).
  \item \textbf{Lanternbone.} Resin set in a healed break. \emph{Gift:} glow faintly to mark safe steps; \emph{once/scene} grant ally \emph{Position +1} on footing checks. \emph{Keys:} night watch, seed-tithe. \emph{Curse:} beacon—predators test the light (GM may spend SB to start \emph{Hungry Eyes [2]}).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Curses as Lost Context}
A Mark becomes a \textbf{Curse} when used without its Keys or against its ethic.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Context Drift [4].} Ticks when a Mark is invoked off-season, off-place, or without witness. On fill, the Mark expresses its \emph{Curse} until \emph{Context is Restored}.
  \item \textbf{Context Restored (project [4]).} Recover Keys: return to place, invite songkeeper, repay light-due. Aelinnel \emph{Sumwright gloss-trees} can substitute for witness once.
  \item \textbf{Burden Ledger [6].} Tracks obligation from inherited knowledge. On fill, pay with repair years, seed-tithes, or forfeit a String tied to the artifact.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{At the Table (simple levers)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Strings:} \emph{mark-right}, \emph{context key}, \emph{songkeeper witness}, \emph{gloss-tree charter}. Spend to reduce DV by --1 on rites/negotiations tied to that Mark or artifact.
  \item \textbf{Position/Effect:} Most Marks grant \emph{Position +1} or \emph{Effect +1} \emph{once/scene} when used with Keys; without Keys, instead tick \emph{Context Drift}.
  \item \textbf{Mitigation:} Aeler \emph{null-bells} can mute a Mark’s \emph{Curse} for a scene at the cost of \emph{lamp-time} or \emph{Public Outrage [1]} if used in a Lethai court.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Custodians \& Dissent}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Songkeepers} steward Keys and judge when burdens may be set down.
  \item \textbf{Lethai-ar Oathbinders} police oath-Marks; mask rights fall for abusers.
  \item \textbf{Lethai-thora Archivists} map Marks to contexts in \emph{gloss-trees}; Sundered Elves carry these into markets and mistakes.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Hooks}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{The Bark That Broke.} A famed Barkskin bearer shattered in frost—find the missing roof-tree witness before winter claims more.
  \item \textbf{River-Ears in a Dry City.} A collector misuses a Riverstone Book; canals riot. Restore Keys or rewrite dues with a bowl at the fountain.
  \item \textbf{Spider’s Ledger.} Inae’s Mark is called curse after a web-judge froze a harvest lane. Untangle oath from context drift before masks come down.
\end{itemize}

\section{Valewood — Empire Under Leaves}

\subsection*{Living courts, phasing ruins, and the law of guest and host}

\begin{quote}
“Name yourself once, pour water first, and step on the stones. In the Valewood, truth grows wild and the paths remember your feet.”
\end{quote}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{I. What the Valewood Is}
A vast, old-growth forest whose memory runs deeper than city annals. Phasing ruins (\emph{star-roads, living stone, breathing streets}) surface and sink with moon and season; oaths are measured in years of repair. Power moves through \textbf{hospitality}, \textbf{knowledge of ways}, and \textbf{careful speech}. The Lethai-al keep edge-wards and ferry rights; the Lethai-ar hold \emph{web-law} and shaded corridors; fae courts barter in \emph{truth told right now}; beast-kin patrol cairns none can map twice the same way.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{II. Courtesy \& Entry (Shade Etiquette)}
Observe these to avoid waking the wood’s ledgers.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Iron Covered.} Wrap iron in leather or cloth. \emph{(Position +1 on first parley at a hedge or ferry.)}
  \item \textbf{Name Once.} Speak your name and intent at the edge; do not name the forest as property.
  \item \textbf{Step on Stone.} Use set stones and boardwalks; crushed sprouts become \emph{Light-Due}.
  \item \textbf{Water First.} Pour the first cup to the cistern or stream; then drink.
  \item \textbf{Leave the Light.} Replace what you take: plant, mend, or pay \emph{seed-tithe}.
\end{itemize}
\textit{Clocks for breaches:} \textbf{Under-Root Grudge [4]} (tariffs, closed ferries), \textbf{Stream-Clouding [4]} (mill shutdowns, fish wardens).

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{III. Routes \& Taboos (Using the Travel Seed)}
\paragraph{Shadow Corridor (Thin Shore).} The misted coastal lane north–south toward Zakov. Draw \emph{Spade} from Valewood, \emph{Heart} from Mistlands (or Valewood), \emph{Club} from Mistlands (wraiths, bell-line failures), \emph{Diamond} from either Mistlands (\emph{Ward-salt, Lantern Writ}) or Valewood (\emph{Way-Cord, Truce-Bough}) depending on which law you invoke.

\paragraph{Rule of 9s (Valewood \& Theona).} Whenever a 9 appears in a travel seed touching Valewood or the isle moots, add an \textbf{omission}: a missing step, an unsaid name, an unseen guest. If the 9 is a \emph{Diamond}, you may break the taboo once—someone will come to collect. Treat the omission as a one-scene \emph{Shared Complication} the table must name.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{IV. Places That Hold (Spade Prompts)}
Use as scenes, sets, or advantages:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Star-Road Shard.} Pale flagstones hum when trod in order; a gate stirs if you match the cadence.
  \item \textbf{Rooted Amphitheatre.} Moss seats remember speeches not yet given; debate here shapes routes.
  \item \textbf{Glyphed Bridge.} Lies make glyphs glow; truth pays the toll.
  \item \textbf{Calendar Grove.} Solstice-aligned trunks; one tree is stone—time tallies are read here.
  \item \textbf{Unfound Arcade.} Arches appear at dusk, vanish at dawn; reality keeps hours.
  \item \textbf{Breathing City.} Vine-choked streets shift on the hour; the ruin is alive and listening.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{V. Pressures of the Wood (Club Prompts)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Ward-Trap.} Ancient mechanisms treat you like yesterday’s invader; tools and talk jam.
  \item \textbf{Oath-Magnet.} Words stick; a careless promise rewrites your plan (\emph{start a Task Clock you named aloud}).
  \item \textbf{Geas Catch.} A phrase turns into a job that names itself; the wood expects it done.
  \item \textbf{Name-Theft.} Edges of your true name are sampled; masks come down unless paid in courtesy.
  \item \textbf{Muster of Boughs.} Green banners rise—travel becomes trespass until a \emph{Truce-Bough} is raised.
  \item \textbf{Mirror Rain.} Leaf-drips replay choices you didn’t make; doubt taxes Position until resolved.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{VI. Charms, Rights, \& Papers (Diamond Prompts)}
Treat these as \emph{Strings} that spend like documents or single-use boons:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Way-Cord.} Knot that points to the true next turn once. \emph{Spend:} DV --1 on Navigate/Scout; negates one \emph{Sweet Wind} lie.
  \item \textbf{Dew-Mirror.} Shows a thing as it is, not as sung, for one scene. \emph{Spend:} reveal a concealed intent or hazard; ignore one glamour.
  \item \textbf{Hazel Token.} Lawful crossing of a warded hedge without snag. \emph{Spend:} Position +1 to pass an edge-ward.
  \item \textbf{Honey-Right.} Eat and speak under bee-stone protection. \emph{Spend:} immunity to first social SB this parley.
  \item \textbf{Name-Bead.} Kept promise warms, broken one chills and glows. \emph{Spend:} convert one consequence into \emph{Repair Work [4]}.
  \item \textbf{Truce-Bough.} Cut, hunt, or camp in a named copse without offense. \emph{Spend:} suppress \emph{Muster of Boughs} for a scene.
  \item \textbf{City-Shard.} Wake one gate or stair in a phasing ruin. \emph{Spend:} create an exit where none is seen.
  \item \textbf{Oathsap.} Seal a pact that even echoes respect. \emph{Spend:} turn a verbal concession into a season-long right.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{VII. People \& Practice}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Pathweavers.} Guides who knot safe routes into cord; their cords double as minutes of what was promised on the way.
  \item \textbf{Wardens of the Roof-Tree.} Canopy surveyors and hedge-keepers; they measure damage in \emph{repair years}.
  \item \textbf{Silk Engineers (Lethai-ar).} Keep night lanes and warning webs; \emph{mask rights} fall for oath abuse.
  \item \textbf{Songkeepers.} Render gloss and context for old speech; without them, even yesterday’s syntax can betray.
  \item \textbf{Beast-Kin.} Border guardians tied to cairns and seasons; they bargain in food, paths, and respect.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{VIII. War by Shade (Deterrence in the Valewood)}
The wood teaches \emph{route warfare}: make supply walk twice; end campaigns by ledger. Ambushes begin at \emph{Dominant} under rain or understory; invaders who \emph{step on stone} and keep iron covered may parley for escorted withdrawal instead of bleed for it. Before anyone plans a forest campaign, start \textbf{“Leave Them Alone” [2]}; on fill, command chooses tariff, treaty, or route-around.

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{IX. Integration Hooks}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Political Intrigue.} \emph{Bowl, Board, and Shade}: fairness, then geometry, then courtesy. Convert a concession into a \emph{season-long right} at a ford, gate, or pasture.
  \item \textbf{Caravans.} Shadow Corridor runs require \emph{Way-Cord} or \emph{Lantern Writ}. Mistland law (ward-salt) vs. Valewood law (truce-bough) determines your final judgment.
  \item \textbf{Wilderness.} Treat edge-wards and fuel mosaics as special orders during camp phases; blight quarantine uses \emph{ash-wash stations}.
  \item \textbf{Aeler Roads.} \emph{Keystone-in-Bark} accords: Aeler choose tread, Lethai choose line. Breaking either creates fines paid as \emph{repair years}.
  \item \textbf{Ykrul Borders.} \emph{Silence Furlong}: cross wordless, then speak once. Keep it and reduce DV --1 on pasture passage; break it and tick \emph{Furlong Breach}.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{X. Omens \& Seeds}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Sweet Wind.} A breeze that lies kindly; \emph{Wind-Veil} mutes it for a walk.
  \item \textbf{Missing Ninth.} Somewhere a ninth step or name is absent; pay in favors or get lost kindly.
  \item \textbf{Bell-Line Failure.} Mistland lantern law flickers; wraith indemnities come due.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Adventure Seeds}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{The Bowl at the Bridge.} A \emph{Glyphed Bridge} lights at every lie; arbitrate a toll war using \emph{Bowl, Board, and Shade}.
  \item \textbf{Way-Cord for a Price.} A pathweaver demands a \emph{Name-Bead} to knot your route; who pays when it chills?
  \item \textbf{Empire Wakes.} A \emph{Breathing City} aligns at dusk; open a \emph{City-Shard} gate or be counted as yesterday’s invader.
  \item \textbf{Silk and Sluice.} Lethai-ar web-law snared a patrol; river pilots claim the weir saved three villages. Balance oath and repair.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip\hrule\medskip

\subsection{XI. At the Table (Simple Levers)}
Keep to core ladders—use these as narrative permissions:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Context Strings} (\emph{gloss-tree, songkeeper witness}) reduce DV --1 when reading/pleading in older registers.
  \item \textbf{Light-Due \& Seed-Tithe} convert fines into \emph{Repair Projects [4]} instead of exile or coin.
  \item \textbf{Way-Cord / Truce-Bough / Dew-Mirror} spend for single-scene Position/DV shifts as listed; abusing them starts \emph{Under-Root Grudge}.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Portrayal note:} Let policy speak before mystique—ferries, hedges, quotas, and the cost of light—then add the wonder: paths that hum, rain that remembers, courts that sit where the river can overhear.

      \item Immune to The Curse of Division
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Cultural Mechanics}

\subsection*{Shade Etiquette}
Lethai-al courtesy that grants hospitality and hearing:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Iron Covered:} Bare iron offends ward-lines; wrap it in leather or cloth. (On first entry, covered iron grants Position +1 in parley)
  \item \textbf{Name Once:} Speak your name and intent at the edge; do not name the forest as property
  \item \textbf{Step on Stone:} Where stones are laid, use them; every crushed sprout is a debt
  \item \textbf{Water First:} Pour a first cup to the river or cistern before you drink
  \item \textbf{Leave the Light:} Replace the shade you take: plant, mend, or pay
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Light-Due System}
Light and shade are currencies. Every fell, ferry, and fire has a light-due—balance to be repaid in replanting, canal-clearing, or trade at kinder rates.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cash a light-due to gain DV -1 on operations framed as repair, replanting, or flood work
  \item Abuse it and start Under-Root Grudge [1]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Context Keys}
Lethai speech requires context keys:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Place-name, season-mark, kinship-hand, and roof-tree sign
  \item Absent any two, assume misreadings
  \item When reading or pleading in older registers, increase DV by +1 unless holding a Context String
  \item Cashing a Context String reduces DV by -1 and creates a Shared Frame (Position +1 on first exchange)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Strings (Lethai Cultural Influence)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \stringtype{Light-Due Receipt:} Balance to be repaid in environmental work
  \item \stringtype{Shade-Credit:} Favor with forest communities
  \item \stringtype{Ferry Right:} Priority passage on waterways
  \item \stringtype{Resin Share:} Access to valuable forest products
  \item \stringtype{Canoe-Lane Priority:} Preferred river routes
  \item \stringtype{Seed Tithe:} Right to harvest forest reproduction
  \item \stringtype{Spider-Vow Token:} Oathbound commitment marker
  \item \stringtype{Serpent Oath:} Isoka-bound promise
  \item \stringtype{Silk-Tithe:} Payment for web-based services
  \item \stringtype{Gloss-Tree Charter:} Authority to interpret ancient texts
  \item \stringtype{Canal Seal:} Waterway management rights
  \item \stringtype{Ledger Witness:} Authority in scholarly disputes
  \item \stringtype{Keystone Courtesy:} Aeler-Lethai cooperation agreements
  \item \stringtype{River-Weir Writ:} Dam and water control permissions
  \item \stringtype{Windbreak Right:} Ykrul-Lethai border accommodations
  \item \stringtype{Border-Song:} Cross-cultural musical agreements
\end{itemize}

\section*{Patron Relationships}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Lethai-al:} Often bond with nature-related Patrons (Old Man of the Black Forest, Carrion King, Nidhoggr)
  \item \textbf{Lethai-thora:} Prefer knowledge-related Patrons (The Witness, Sacred Geometry, Clockwork Monad)
  \item \textbf{Lethai-ar:} Bond with Inae (spiders) or Isoka (serpents) - dark, transformative Patrons
  \item \textbf{Half-elves:} Can bond with any Patron but often struggle with divided loyalties
\end{itemize}

\section*{Complications}
\complicationtype{The Curse of Division:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item When attempting to use talents from both paths, suffer -1 die to all rolls until scene ends
  \item Can only advance in one path per tier without the Bridge of Gifts talent
\end{itemize}

\complicationtype{Contextual Communication:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cannot effectively communicate with other Lethai without proper context keys
  \item Modern elven speech confuses outsiders (-1 die to social rolls with non-elves)
  \item Reading old texts requires special effort or assistance
\end{itemize}

\complicationtype{Cultural Tension:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lethai-al and Lethai-thora communities often distrust each other
  \item Half-elves face prejudice from both communities
  \item Lethai-ar are feared and often ostracized
\end{itemize}

\complicationtype{Environmental Responsibility:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Every action in natural environments has consequences
  \item Breaking Shade Etiquette triggers social and environmental backlash
  \item Light-dues accumulate and must be repaid
\end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Web-Law, River-Law:} Lethai-ar silk syndics claim a bridge-toll by Inae's charter; Lethai-thora auditors counter with canal clauses. Bowl, then Board, then Shade Etiquette.
  \item \textbf{Bridge-Born in Question:} A half-elf prodigy manifests both gifts; a circle moves to forbid the rite. Protect or persuade before the masks come down.

\section*{Integration with Core Rules}

\subsection*{The Curse Mechanic}
The Curse of Division works as a persistent condition:
\begin{itemize}
  \item When a Lethai attempts to use talents from both paths in the same scene, mark 1 segment on a Curse Clock [4]
  \item When the clock fills, suffer -1 die to all rolls until the next dawn
  \item The Bridge-Born Clause talent negates this effect
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{War by Shade}
Lethai defensive warfare principles:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Hedge War:} Edge-wards channel intruders into dead ground pockets (Invader Move/Scout DV +1)
  \item \textbf{River Denial:} Ferries vanish, weirs open, mills idle (Start Supply Strangle [4] on hostile forces)
  \item \textbf{Night Lanes:} Web-law trip lines, single strikes, venom as medicine (First ambush in dim light begins at Dominant)
  \item \textbf{Canopy Runners:} Movement above sight-lines, arrows from impossible angles (Once/scene, convert pursuit to parley/retreat with Position +1)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Terrain Tags}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Hedge Mosaic:} Invaders suffer DV +1 on Navigate/Scout; first defender action gains Position +1
  \item \textbf{Resin Smoke:} On ignition, obscure vision and sting eyes; convert first Ranged Harm 1 against defenders to Fatigue
  \item \textbf{Stone Steps:} If invaders step on stone and keep iron covered, begin in Shared Frame (DV -1 to request safe passage)
\end{itemize}

  {\LARGE Ge'hai — Those Who Carry the Edge}
  
  \bigskip
  {\large Lethai elite cadres in body and in mind}
  \end{center}
  
  Among the Lethai, ge'hai is not a rank so much as a charge: to carry the edge where the people meet the world. The title is awarded in moot by three witnesses—one of body, one of mind, and one of place (a grove, a hall, a lamp under beam). From that day a ge'hai belongs to the work more than to themselves.
  
  Two great traditions shape them:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Lethai-al ge'hai (``People of the Body'')} — canopy commandos and keystone saboteurs, feared for asymmetric warfare and the calm speed with which they unmake an enemy's plan.
  \item \textbf{Lethai-thora ge'hai (``People of the Mind'')} — court tacticians and context-binders, infamous for turning rooms with etiquette, syntax, and the careful placement of witnesses.
  \end{itemize}
  
  Both hold the same maxim: \textbf{thread before blade}. Bind the harm; if binding fails, cut cleanly.
  
  \bigskip
  
  \section*{I. Lethai-al Ge'hai — Bark \& Sinew}
  
  \textbf{Doctrine:} Silence, keystone, vanish. Lethai-al ge'hai do not ``win battles''; they remove the pieces battles would need—ferries, fodder, bridges, nerve.
  
  \textbf{Training:} Night-sight drills, breath discipline, canopy movement, keystone reading (how a structure stands), mark-keeping (context tattoos that store orders and prices), and silence furlong protocol (no names, no smoke, no steel until witness).
  
  \textbf{Typical cadre (6–12):}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Path-Cutter} (route denial; hedge \& rope),
  \item \textbf{Keystone-Reader} (ferries, arches, dam lips),
  \item \textbf{Lantern-Thief} (light management; moon-mirrors),
  \item \textbf{Molt-Keeper} (field medic; poison/antidote pairing),
  \item \textbf{Whisper-Sergeant} (hand-sign command),
  \item \textbf{Sable-Bow} (harassment, lure, pursuit break).
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{Field rites \& etiquette}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mask-Right (field):} canvas veils with inked roles; parley can be held anywhere the masks are donned.
  \item \textbf{Vial Courtesy:} dose and cure travel together; to harm without an offered remedy is a ge'hai sin.
  \item \textbf{Speak Twice:} the order is given in common speech and then once in sign; if they diverge, the sign holds.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{Operations menu (what they actually do):}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Keystone Audit:} Mark the one stone, beam, or rope that bears a route. Remove or mend as needed; leave a repair year ledger if you break it.
  \item \textbf{Lamp Game:} Extinguish all but one light to create an honor lane. Pursuers must slow or lose face.
  \item \textbf{Gardened Ambush:} Shape a killing ground with vines, wire, and scent; fire once, then disappear into the furlong.
  \item \textbf{Ferry Night:} Hold a river crossing with bell-tokens and chalked prices; turn a rout into an orderly retreat.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{Strings / Diamonds they carry:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Context Key} (treat a warded path as neutral once),
  \item \textbf{Mask-Right Seal} (declare parley under silk in the open),
  \item \textbf{Bell Token} (ring Bell Dawn to convert lethal fallout into payable cost),
  \item \textbf{Repair Beads} (pre-pledged seasons of mending).
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{At the table (mechanical hooks):}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In forest, under canopy, or along a marked furlong: Position +1 once per scene when acting unseen or disengaging.
  \item When a keystone is correctly identified in fiction, treat sabotage or shoring as DV −1.
  \item Spending a Bell Token in a retreat converts one lethal consequence to a named price or clock.
  \item Breaking Vial Courtesy or Mask-Right gives adversaries Position +1 against the cadre until amends are made.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{Three Lethai-al ge'hai ``builds'' (PC or cohort templates):}
  
  \textbf{1. Lantern-Thief — light control \& exits}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Edges:} Athletics, Stealth, Notice; Tags: Moon-Mirror, Smoke Net, Night Cord
  \item \textbf{Moves:} Steal the Lamp (shift a scene into dim—your terrain), Draw the Eye (create a false exit), Honor Lane (force pursuers to slow or suffer DV +1)
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{2. Keystone-Reader — bridges, ferries, gates}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Edges:} Engineering/Lore (structures), Survival (water), Tinkering
  \item \textbf{Moves:} Name the Stone (spot the load point), Mend or Break (choose repair-year or collapse), Toll-Binder (chalk a temporary tariff that even foes hesitate to cross)
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{3. Molt-Keeper — poison/antidote doctrine}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Edges:} Medicine, Alchemy, Insight
  \item \textbf{Moves:} Paired Vials (harm with an offered cure; secures parley), Clean Cut (field amputation as exit), Venom Truce (threat of escalation traded for withdrawal)
  \end{itemize}
  
  \newpage
  
  \section*{II. Lethai-thora Ge'hai — Vowel \& Veil}
  
  \textbf{Doctrine:} Name the room, bind the hour, tilt the future. They win by re-contexting: changing who counts as host/guest, who speaks under lamp, which ledger (Said/Meant) the court will honor, and what it would cost to ignore either.
  
  \textbf{Training:} Living grammar (syntax drift law), mask etiquette, ledger craft (recording Said \& Meant together), witness choreography (who stands under the lamp and when), memory palaces, and mark curation (retiring inherited marks before they turn to curses).
  
  \textbf{Court kit:} travel masks with role-ink, ribbon ledgers, name-beads for witness, bell-cord for single-lamp rites, antidote rings, and context knives (ritual blades that cut bonds after prices are named).
  
  \textbf{Operations menu:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Two-Ledger Trial:} Force both letter and spirit on the table; the losing party must pay in repair years or reputation.
  \item \textbf{Mask Moot:} Declare roles, then seal parley under silk; shunts a lethal standoff into posture, concessions, and clocks.
  \item \textbf{Context Turn:} Move a meeting under a single lamp; what was rumor becomes witness. Truths spoken thereafter stick.
  \item \textbf{Molt Design:} Free a trapped official into a new name and role; avoid civil blood by changing the piece, not the board.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{Strings / Diamonds they carry:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Clause-Bead} (insert a contingency into a live deal),
  \item \textbf{Name-Bead} (elevate witness under lamp; testimony counts),
  \item \textbf{Weaver's Writ} (bind a multi-party compact across language drift),
  \item \textbf{Shed-Skin Letter} (sanctioned exit from a coercive identity—price named, future favor owed).
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{At the table (mechanical hooks):}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When Mask-Right is established, treat first parley as Risky→Controlled (Position +1).
  \item Presenting Said \& Meant together gives DV −1 to negotiate clauses; hiding one allows GM to spend SB for False Context complications.
  \item A declared under-beam witness turns a soft truth into a binding statement; refusing to stand under lamp shifts Effect −1 for your side until you do.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{Three Lethai-thora ge'hai ``builds'':}
  
  \textbf{1. Ribbon-Reader — contract surgeon}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Edges:} Diplomacy, Law/Customs, Insight
  \item \textbf{Moves:} Read the Stitch (spot hidden clause), Mercy-Knot (turn harm into a payable price), Seal of Seasons (make a concession last one season only)
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{2. Mask-Herald — room control}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Edges:} Performance, Command, Etiquette
  \item \textbf{Moves:} Call the Roles (fix who is host/guest), Veil the Blade (threats become symbols; tempers cool), Seat the Witness (choose who stands under lamp)
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{3. Shed-Singer — identity exits}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Edges:} Deception, Medicine/Lore (rites), Sway
  \item \textbf{Moves:} Design the Molt (legal/social escape plan with debt), Cure in the Cup (always carry a public antidote), Word-Cut (ritual severance after price named)
  \end{itemize}
  
  \newpage
  
  \section*{III. Friction, Rivalry, Integration}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{With Ykrul:} Silence furlongs and Bowl \& Board share a border. Ge'hai respect Ykrul placement, but price behavior, not routes. Joint treaties tend to work; joint insults tend to last.
  \item \textbf{With Aeler:} Under-beam witness versus mask-right parley creates jurisdictional puzzles. Aeler Spirit Shields prefer lamps; Lethai-thora prefer silk. Ge'hai learn both.
  \item \textbf{With Lethai-ar:} Many ge'hai are also vowed (Weaver/Serpent). Coil and web add sharp edges: cure-paired poisons, mercy-knots, and the taboo against binding without consent.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \section*{IV. Story Heat (drop-in complications)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mark Gone Sour.} A cherished ge'hai mark has lost its last living context. It behaves like a curse (insomnia, compulsions). Repair the story or retire the mark.
  \item \textbf{Lamp vs. Veil.} A frontier court demands under-beam witness; the ge'hai require mask-right for safety. Can both thresholds be honored?
  \item \textbf{The Price of Cure.} A tyrant's enforcer begs a molt. The cure exists; naming its price may break a city.
  \item \textbf{Silence Broken.} A silence furlong is violated by foreign scouts; Lethai-al ge'hai must re-stitch the corridor before a war learns to speak there.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \section*{V. Playing Ge'hai (tone \& presence)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Lethai-al:} move like a solved puzzle; every gesture pre-answers a chase. They speak with hands first. Their mercy is letting you leave by the exit they already cut.
  \item \textbf{Lethai-thora:} attend to breath, posture, and lamp distance. They do not ``win arguments''—they decide which truths exist in this room for this season.
  \end{itemize}
  
  Ge'hai do not seek glory. They seek rooms that stop killing people and roads that keep their promises. If you meet them at night, listen: the solution is already hanging from the next branch or folded in the next word; your only choice is whether you can live with its price.
