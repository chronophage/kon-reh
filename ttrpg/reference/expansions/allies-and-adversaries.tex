\section*{Design Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Companions with teeth:} Followers act on-screen and off-screen with clear risks, clocks, and costs.
  \item \textbf{Social fabric as engine:} Loyalty, morale, bonds, and rivalries generate scenes and consequences.
  \item \textbf{Organizations as levers:} Cohorts and institutions move through clocks, strings, and orders without spreadsheets.
  \item \textbf{Plug into core:} Uses Position/DV, SB, clocks, Favor/Leverage/Exposure, Reputation, and Strings. No new dice math.
\end{itemize}
\emph{Principle:} Add procedures and tracks that tell you when to roll, what to tick, and how to escalate.

\section*{Quickstart (2 minutes)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Make 1--3 \textbf{Follower Sheets}; mark \textbf{Loyalty [6]} and \textbf{Morale [6]} on each.
  \item Attach \textbf{Strings} the follower controls (permits, keys, oaths). These matter more than stats.
  \item Pick an \textbf{Organization} (if any) and fill \textbf{Cohesion [6--8]}, \textbf{Exposure [6]}, and \textbf{Bandwidth} (orders/phase) = 1--3.
  \item At scene start, choose for each follower: \textbf{Assist}, \textbf{Cover}, or \textbf{Delegate}.
  \item Between sessions, run \textbf{Orders \& Entanglements} for organizations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Follower Sheets \& Templates}
\subsection{Follower Sheet (Template)}
\begin{verbatim}
[NAME & ROLE]
Tier: Green / Trained / Veteran / Elite
Playbook: Combat Ally / Specialist / Magical Assistant
Capabilities (2–3): short phrases like "shield wall", "ledger-eye", "silent step"
Edges (1–2): what they do exceptionally well
Liabilities (1–2): what gets them in trouble
Strings (1–3): permits, keys, rites, access, local reputation
Costs: wages / shares / favor / oath / taboo
Tracks:
- Loyalty [6]: long-term commitment to the PCs' cause
- Morale [6]: short-term willingness to risk; wavers in hard scenes
- Harm [3]: minor / serious / broken (or corrupted, if mystical)
Tags: (2–3 personal or social tags that matter on-screen)
Notes: relationships, debts, secret, ambition
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Tier (quality) guidance}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Green:} When acting alone, start one step worse Position.
  \item \textbf{Trained:} Baseline Position.
  \item \textbf{Veteran:} Treat DV --1 when acting on their Capabilities.
  \item \textbf{Elite:} Position +1 when acting on their Edges.
\end{itemize}
\emph{No new dice.} Followers don't have separate pools; their tier nudges Position/DV and their tracks/tags determine fallout.

\subsection{Templates}
\subsubsection*{Combat Ally (guard, scout, duelist)}
Capabilities: formation fighting; hold a doorway; skirmish in alleys\\
Edges: fearless under missile fire; shield others\\
Liabilities: pride; feud; easily baited\\
Strings: watch rotation; barracks armory key\\
Costs: shares; honor code taboo

\subsubsection*{Specialist (scribe, pilot, barrister, spy, apothecary)}
Capabilities: crack ledgers; navigate fog; writs \& filings; ghost a meeting; treat wounds\\
Edges: unobtrusive; encyclopedic gossip\\
Liabilities: temper; debts; guild loyalty first\\
Strings: archive desk; ferry passbooks; guild seals\\
Costs: wages; bribe budget; guild tithes

\subsubsection*{Magical Assistant (rite-acolyte, hedge-mage, psion acolyte)}
Capabilities: ward a room; amplify rites; anchor a vision; soothe a crowd\\
Edges: ritual precision; calm presence\\
Liabilities: taboo; frail; omen-prone\\
Strings: sanctuary access; oath-tablet registry; reliquary key\\
Costs: offerings; rest days; ritual purity

\subsection{Onboarding a Follower}
Name two non-overlapping Capabilities and one Liability; the table adds one Tag. Tie them to the map with one \textbf{String} that matters this arc. Mark \textbf{Loyalty 2/6}, \textbf{Morale 3/6}, Harm none.

\section{Followers On-Scene}
At the start of a scene, declare the role for each present follower.

\subsection{Assist}
They bolster a PC's action on their Capability.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Effect:} Improve \textbf{Position +1} \emph{or} treat \textbf{DV --1} (once/scene per follower).
  \item \textbf{SB Hook:} On any 1 in the roll, the GM may tick follower \textbf{Morale +1} (shaken) or \textbf{Harm (minor)} instead of a PC-facing complication.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cover}
They absorb heat or run interference.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Effect:} Once this scene, reduce a GM \textbf{Social SB} spend by 1 or cancel a single \textbf{tag flip} against the party in their venue.
  \item \textbf{Cost:} Tick follower \textbf{Exposure +1} (if tracked) or \textbf{Morale +1} (took the blame).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Delegate}
They take an independent scene action (legwork, duel, petition, infiltration). Resolve with the \textbf{PC's roll} that commands, enables, or coordinates (e.g., Presence+Command, Wits+Tactics, Wits+Investigation).
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Effect:} On a hit, fill the target Situation Clock by effect or create a useful tag; on a partial, do it but suffer \textbf{Harm (minor)} or \textbf{Morale +1}; on a miss, GM banks SB and may apply a temporary Liability tag (e.g., \emph{Compromised}).
  \item \textbf{Tier Nudge:} Apply the Tier bonus/penalty when setting Position/DV.
\end{itemize}
\emph{Alone vs with PCs:} Acting alone in hostile ground starts one Position worse; with a PC on-screen, use the higher Position among the pair.

\subsection{Harm \& Recovery}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Harm [3]:} minor (--) / serious (can't Assist/Delegate) / broken (removed until healed). Treat mystic overloads similarly.
  \item \textbf{Heal:} \emph{Shield} or \emph{Biofeedback} scenes may reduce Harm; otherwise Significant Time + coin/favor reduces one level.
\end{itemize}

\section{Loyalty \& Morale}
\subsection{Loyalty [6] (long-term)}
Tick up when promises are kept, credit/coin shared, public protection given, or their Ambition advances. Tick down for oath-breaking, humiliation, skipped payment, or betrayal of values.\\
At 0: they leave or flip neutral (rescue resets to 1). At 6: trigger a \textbf{Loyalty Event}---they offer an oath or ask a Price; choose for a lasting Tag (e.g., \emph{Oath-Bound}) or a new String.

\subsection{Morale [6] (short-term)}
Mark Morale for fear, hunger, injury, or public shame.
\begin{itemize}
  \item 4+: bold; may Assist/Delegate freely.
  \item 2--3: hesitant; Delegate starts one Position worse.
  \item 0--1: balk; require \emph{Reassure} (Presence+Sway) or \emph{Command} at DV 3--4 to act; on miss, they withdraw.
  \item \textbf{Reset:} Rest, food, respect scene, or public praise clears 1--2 Morale.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Paying the Costs}
Each follower lists Costs (wages, shares, favor, taboo). When skipped two sessions in a row, tick Loyalty --1 and start \textbf{Debt [4]}. Clearing the clock cancels the penalty.

\section{Follower Advancement (Long-Term)}
At arc end or every 2--3 sessions, if the follower was central, choose one:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Capability +1:} add a new Capability or sharpen an Edge; gain that Edge's Tier nudge for one more context.
  \item \textbf{String Gained:} seize/cut a String via play; write it on their sheet.
  \item \textbf{Harm Tolerance:} add \emph{Armor (1)} tag once per session when acting on their Capabilities.
  \item \textbf{Bond Deepens:} start \textbf{Bond [4]} with a PC; acting for that PC's ideal grants Position +1 once/scene.
  \item \textbf{Reputation:} convert three favors from one institution into \textbf{Standing (Tag)} tied to the follower.
\end{itemize}
If a follower becomes plot-defining, promote them to a \textbf{Lieutenant}: they can carry an \textbf{Off-Screen Order} without PC oversight.

\section{Organizations (Guilds, Armies, Syndicates)}
\subsection{Organization Sheet (Template)}
\begin{verbatim}
[ORG NAME]
Tier: street / guild / city / crown / synod
Aim (this season): what this org wants now
Leaders & Lieutenants: names + one-line intent
Cohorts (2–4): "dockside crew", "auditors", "pickets" …
Strings (3): permits, routes, seals, charters
Tracks:
- Cohesion [6–8]: unity/discipline; fill → schism/strike/coup
- Exposure [6]: heat/visibility; fill → audit/raid/purge
- Resources [6]: operational slack; empty → shortages & concessions
Bandwidth: 1–3 orders per cycle
Entanglements: debts, rivals, promises
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Using Cohorts}
A cohort is a follower group. When a cohort acts on-screen, apply Tier nudges like a Veteran/Elite follower. Wounds/fear usually tick \textbf{Cohesion +1} rather than individual Harm.

\subsection{Orders \& Entanglements (Between Sessions)}
Once per session or when Significant Time passes:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Allocate Bandwidth:} choose up to Bandwidth orders: Audit, Guard, Smuggle, Petition, Strike-bust/Strike, Patrol, Build, Research, Evangelize, Bribe, Expose.
  \item \textbf{Resolve Each Order:} one roll by the directing PC (or a Lieutenant). Set Position/DV from fiction; apply Org Tier as DV --1 within its wheelhouse.
  \item \textbf{On Hit:} fill a related Project Clock (4--8) or create a lasting Tag. On 1s, GM banks SB and may tick Exposure +1 or Cohesion +1.
  \item \textbf{Upkeep:} if Resources drops to 0, choose: accept Crisis +1, lose Bandwidth --1, or start \textbf{Shortages [6]}.
  \item \textbf{Entanglement Roll:} for each banked SB this cycle, trigger a minor entanglement (rival, debt call-in, inspector visit). Convert into clocks, not binary losses.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Relationship Dynamics}
\subsection{Bonds \& Frictions}
Start a \textbf{Bond [4]} between a PC and a follower who has shared scenes. When the PC publicly protects/praises the follower, fill 1; when they shame or endanger them, clear 1. When full, add a permanent tag (\emph{Devoted}, \emph{Trusted Confidant}); once per scene, acting in line with that bond grants Position +1.\\
\textbf{Frictions [4]} capture triangles, rival mentors, or ideology splits. On fill, start a \textbf{Follower Conflict} or add the tag \emph{Soured}.

\subsection{Romance \& Family (optional)}
Treat as Bonds with consent. A full romance Bond may convert to a \textbf{String} (access to a house/court) or a \textbf{cost} (taboos, obligations).

\subsection{Reputation \& Standing}
Followers can hold \textbf{Standing} with institutions. In that venue, Standing acts like a once/scene Position +1 or DV --1, and counts toward party reputation checks.

\section{Follower Conflicts}
\subsection{When Allies Disagree}
Frame the splitting question. Start a \textbf{Dilemma Clock [4--6]}. Each side argues via Petition/Broker/Expose; use Assist/Cover from their allies. On 1s, spend Social SB to escalate: \emph{Ultimatum}, \emph{Walk-out}, \emph{Leverage Leak}, \emph{Public Scene}, \emph{Split the Crew}.\\
\textbf{Resolution:} on fill choose one---\textbf{Concession} (one side wins; other Loyalty --1), \textbf{Compromise} (create a new String you must honor), or \textbf{Break} (follower departs; start \textbf{Recruit/Repair [6]}).

\subsection{Competing Agendas (Long-Term)}
Give key followers a private \textbf{Agenda [4]} tied to a String or ideal. Tick when off-screen orders favor them; clear when you publicly choose against it. On fill, they demand a scene to cash it in---or flip a String against you.

\section{Generators \& Tables}
\subsection{Follower Seeds (d66)}
11--12: penitent enforcer; 13--14: debt-sold pilot; 15--16: oath-keep scribe; 21--22: relic courier; 23--24: disgraced auditor; 25--26: crowd-reader mummer; 31--32: hedge-rite acolyte; 33--34: picket captain; 35--36: ash-lantern warden; 41--42: smugglers' quartermaster; 43--44: bridge-lord's nephew; 45--46: psion novice; 51--52: syndicate fixer; 53--54: canal pilot; 55--56: inquisitor's clerk; 61--62: ex-legion drill; 63--64: dye house chemist; 65--66: caravan law clerk.

\subsection{Costs \& Ambitions}
\textbf{Costs:} wages; shares; favor; bribes; offerings; rest days; ritual purity; family duty.\\
\textbf{Ambitions:} vindication; mastery; homecoming; reform; riches; reputation; faith; revenge; discovery.

\subsection{Entanglements (roll 1--2 between sessions)}
Rival poaches a cohort; Auditor audits your Strings; a family claim interrupts a mission; Debtor calls; old oath resurfaces; festival duel challenge; informant flips; patrol biased; riot brewing in their home ward.

\section{Example of Play (short)}
\textbf{Scene:} The party needs a sealed ledger from the Archivolt. Their \emph{Specialist} (ledger-eye) \textbf{Delegates} to pull it during a playhouse feast. Position: \textbf{Dominant} (venue tags + String); Tier: \textbf{Veteran} (DV --1). Roll \emph{Wits+Investigation} to coordinate. Partial: ledger secured but \textbf{Morale +1}. A 1 shows $\to$ GM spends Social SB to start \textbf{Rumor [4]} about bribery.\\
Between sessions, the party's \textbf{Guild} runs two \textbf{Orders}: \emph{Audit} (to validate the ledger) and \emph{Bribe} (to cushion exposure). One hit, one partial: a \textbf{Project [6]} advances; \textbf{Exposure +1} ticks on the Guild. Next arc, the Specialist's \textbf{Agenda [4]} (protect guild loyalties) fills and they demand edits before release.
