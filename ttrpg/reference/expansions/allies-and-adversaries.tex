\section*{Design Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Companions with teeth:} Followers act on-screen and off-screen with clear risks, clocks, and costs.
  \item \textbf{Social fabric as engine:} Loyalty, morale, bonds, and rivalries generate scenes and consequences.
  \item \textbf{Organizations as levers:} Cohorts and institutions move through clocks, strings, and orders without spreadsheets.
  \item \textbf{Plug into core:} Uses Position/DV, SB, clocks, Favor/Leverage/Exposure, Reputation, and Strings. No new dice math.
\end{itemize}
\emph{Principle:} Add procedures and tracks that tell you when to roll, what to tick, and how to escalate.

\section*{Quickstart (2 minutes)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Make 1--3 \textbf{Follower Sheets}; mark \textbf{Loyalty [6]} and \textbf{Morale [6]} on each.
  \item Attach \textbf{Strings} the follower controls (permits, keys, oaths). These matter more than stats.
  \item Pick an \textbf{Organization} (if any) and fill \textbf{Cohesion [6--8]}, \textbf{Exposure [6]}, and \textbf{Bandwidth} (orders/phase) = 1--3.
  \item At scene start, choose for each follower: \textbf{Assist}, \textbf{Cover}, or \textbf{Delegate}.
  \item Between sessions, run \textbf{Orders \& Entanglements} for organizations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Follower Sheets \& Templates}
\subsection{Follower Sheet (Template)}
\begin{verbatim}
[NAME & ROLE]
Tier: Green / Trained / Veteran / Elite
Playbook: Combat Ally / Specialist / Magical Assistant
Capabilities (2–3): short phrases like "shield wall", "ledger-eye", "silent step"
Edges (1–2): what they do exceptionally well
Liabilities (1–2): what gets them in trouble
Strings (1–3): permits, keys, rites, access, local reputation
Costs: wages / shares / favor / oath / taboo
Tracks:
- Loyalty [6]: long-term commitment to the PCs' cause
- Morale [6]: short-term willingness to risk; wavers in hard scenes
- Harm [3]: minor / serious / broken (or corrupted, if mystical)
Tags: (2–3 personal or social tags that matter on-screen)
Notes: relationships, debts, secret, ambition
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Tier (quality) guidance}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Green:} When acting alone, start one step worse Position.
  \item \textbf{Trained:} Baseline Position.
  \item \textbf{Veteran:} Treat DV --1 when acting on their Capabilities.
  \item \textbf{Elite:} Position +1 when acting on their Edges.
\end{itemize}
\emph{No new dice.} Followers don't have separate pools; their tier nudges Position/DV and their tracks/tags determine fallout.

\subsection{Templates}
\subsubsection*{Combat Ally (guard, scout, duelist)}
Capabilities: formation fighting; hold a doorway; skirmish in alleys\\
Edges: fearless under missile fire; shield others\\
Liabilities: pride; feud; easily baited\\
Strings: watch rotation; barracks armory key\\
Costs: shares; honor code taboo

\subsubsection*{Specialist (scribe, pilot, barrister, spy, apothecary)}
Capabilities: crack ledgers; navigate fog; writs \& filings; ghost a meeting; treat wounds\\
Edges: unobtrusive; encyclopedic gossip\\
Liabilities: temper; debts; guild loyalty first\\
Strings: archive desk; ferry passbooks; guild seals\\
Costs: wages; bribe budget; guild tithes

\subsubsection*{Magical Assistant (rite-acolyte, hedge-mage, psion acolyte)}
Capabilities: ward a room; amplify rites; anchor a vision; soothe a crowd\\
Edges: ritual precision; calm presence\\
Liabilities: taboo; frail; omen-prone\\
Strings: sanctuary access; oath-tablet registry; reliquary key\\
Costs: offerings; rest days; ritual purity

\subsection{Onboarding a Follower}
Name two non-overlapping Capabilities and one Liability; the table adds one Tag. Tie them to the map with one \textbf{String} that matters this arc. Mark \textbf{Loyalty 2/6}, \textbf{Morale 3/6}, Harm none.

\section{Followers On-Scene}
At the start of a scene, declare the role for each present follower.

\subsection{Assist}
They bolster a PC's action on their Capability.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Effect:} Improve \textbf{Position +1} \emph{or} treat \textbf{DV --1} (once/scene per follower).
  \item \textbf{SB Hook:} On any 1 in the roll, the GM may tick follower \textbf{Morale +1} (shaken) or \textbf{Harm (minor)} instead of a PC-facing complication.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cover}
They absorb heat or run interference.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Effect:} Once this scene, reduce a GM \textbf{Social SB} spend by 1 or cancel a single \textbf{tag flip} against the party in their venue.
  \item \textbf{Cost:} Tick follower \textbf{Exposure +1} (if tracked) or \textbf{Morale +1} (took the blame).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Delegate}
They take an independent scene action (legwork, duel, petition, infiltration). Resolve with the \textbf{PC's roll} that commands, enables, or coordinates (e.g., Presence+Command, Wits+Tactics, Wits+Investigation).
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Effect:} On a hit, fill the target Situation Clock by effect or create a useful tag; on a partial, do it but suffer \textbf{Harm (minor)} or \textbf{Morale +1}; on a miss, GM banks SB and may apply a temporary Liability tag (e.g., \emph{Compromised}).
  \item \textbf{Tier Nudge:} Apply the Tier bonus/penalty when setting Position/DV.
\end{itemize}
\emph{Alone vs with PCs:} Acting alone in hostile ground starts one Position worse; with a PC on-screen, use the higher Position among the pair.

\subsection{Harm \& Recovery}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Harm [3]:} minor (--) / serious (can't Assist/Delegate) / broken (removed until healed). Treat mystic overloads similarly.
  \item \textbf{Heal:} \emph{Shield} or \emph{Biofeedback} scenes may reduce Harm; otherwise Significant Time + coin/favor reduces one level.
\end{itemize}

\section{Loyalty \& Morale}
\subsection{Loyalty [6] (long-term)}
Tick up when promises are kept, credit/coin shared, public protection given, or their Ambition advances. Tick down for oath-breaking, humiliation, skipped payment, or betrayal of values.\\
At 0: they leave or flip neutral (rescue resets to 1). At 6: trigger a \textbf{Loyalty Event}---they offer an oath or ask a Price; choose for a lasting Tag (e.g., \emph{Oath-Bound}) or a new String.

\subsection{Morale [6] (short-term)}
Mark Morale for fear, hunger, injury, or public shame.
\begin{itemize}
  \item 4+: bold; may Assist/Delegate freely.
  \item 2--3: hesitant; Delegate starts one Position worse.
  \item 0--1: balk; require \emph{Reassure} (Presence+Sway) or \emph{Command} at DV 3--4 to act; on miss, they withdraw.
  \item \textbf{Reset:} Rest, food, respect scene, or public praise clears 1--2 Morale.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Paying the Costs}
Each follower lists Costs (wages, shares, favor, taboo). When skipped two sessions in a row, tick Loyalty --1 and start \textbf{Debt [4]}. Clearing the clock cancels the penalty.

\section{Follower Advancement (Long-Term)}
At arc end or every 2--3 sessions, if the follower was central, choose one:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Capability +1:} add a new Capability or sharpen an Edge; gain that Edge's Tier nudge for one more context.
  \item \textbf{String Gained:} seize/cut a String via play; write it on their sheet.
  \item \textbf{Harm Tolerance:} add \emph{Armor (1)} tag once per session when acting on their Capabilities.
  \item \textbf{Bond Deepens:} start \textbf{Bond [4]} with a PC; acting for that PC's ideal grants Position +1 once/scene.
  \item \textbf{Reputation:} convert three favors from one institution into \textbf{Standing (Tag)} tied to the follower.
\end{itemize}
If a follower becomes plot-defining, promote them to a \textbf{Lieutenant}: they can carry an \textbf{Off-Screen Order} without PC oversight.

\section{Organizations (Guilds, Armies, Syndicates)}
\subsection{Organization Sheet (Template)}
\begin{verbatim}
[ORG NAME]
Tier: street / guild / city / crown / synod
Aim (this season): what this org wants now
Leaders & Lieutenants: names + one-line intent
Cohorts (2–4): "dockside crew", "auditors", "pickets" …
Strings (3): permits, routes, seals, charters
Tracks:
- Cohesion [6–8]: unity/discipline; fill → schism/strike/coup
- Exposure [6]: heat/visibility; fill → audit/raid/purge
- Resources [6]: operational slack; empty → shortages & concessions
Bandwidth: 1–3 orders per cycle
Entanglements: debts, rivals, promises
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Using Cohorts}
A cohort is a follower group. When a cohort acts on-screen, apply Tier nudges like a Veteran/Elite follower. Wounds/fear usually tick \textbf{Cohesion +1} rather than individual Harm.

\subsection{Orders \& Entanglements (Between Sessions)}
Once per session or when Significant Time passes:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Allocate Bandwidth:} choose up to Bandwidth orders: Audit, Guard, Smuggle, Petition, Strike-bust/Strike, Patrol, Build, Research, Evangelize, Bribe, Expose.
  \item \textbf{Resolve Each Order:} one roll by the directing PC (or a Lieutenant). Set Position/DV from fiction; apply Org Tier as DV --1 within its wheelhouse.
  \item \textbf{On Hit:} fill a related Project Clock (4--8) or create a lasting Tag. On 1s, GM banks SB and may tick Exposure +1 or Cohesion +1.
  \item \textbf{Upkeep:} if Resources drops to 0, choose: accept Crisis +1, lose Bandwidth --1, or start \textbf{Shortages [6]}.
  \item \textbf{Entanglement Roll:} for each banked SB this cycle, trigger a minor entanglement (rival, debt call-in, inspector visit). Convert into clocks, not binary losses.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Relationship Dynamics}
\subsection{Bonds \& Frictions}
Start a \textbf{Bond [4]} between a PC and a follower who has shared scenes. When the PC publicly protects/praises the follower, fill 1; when they shame or endanger them, clear 1. When full, add a permanent tag (\emph{Devoted}, \emph{Trusted Confidant}); once per scene, acting in line with that bond grants Position +1.\\
\textbf{Frictions [4]} capture triangles, rival mentors, or ideology splits. On fill, start a \textbf{Follower Conflict} or add the tag \emph{Soured}.

\subsection{Romance \& Family (optional)}
Treat as Bonds with consent. A full romance Bond may convert to a \textbf{String} (access to a house/court) or a \textbf{cost} (taboos, obligations).

\subsection{Reputation \& Standing}
Followers can hold \textbf{Standing} with institutions. In that venue, Standing acts like a once/scene Position +1 or DV --1, and counts toward party reputation checks.

\section{Follower Conflicts}
\subsection{When Allies Disagree}
Frame the splitting question. Start a \textbf{Dilemma Clock [4--6]}. Each side argues via Petition/Broker/Expose; use Assist/Cover from their allies. On 1s, spend Social SB to escalate: \emph{Ultimatum}, \emph{Walk-out}, \emph{Leverage Leak}, \emph{Public Scene}, \emph{Split the Crew}.\\
\textbf{Resolution:} on fill choose one---\textbf{Concession} (one side wins; other Loyalty --1), \textbf{Compromise} (create a new String you must honor), or \textbf{Break} (follower departs; start \textbf{Recruit/Repair [6]}).

\subsection{Competing Agendas (Long-Term)}
Give key followers a private \textbf{Agenda [4]} tied to a String or ideal. Tick when off-screen orders favor them; clear when you publicly choose against it. On fill, they demand a scene to cash it in---or flip a String against you.

\section{Generators \& Tables}
\subsection{Follower Seeds (d66)}
11--12: penitent enforcer; 13--14: debt-sold pilot; 15--16: oath-keep scribe; 21--22: relic courier; 23--24: disgraced auditor; 25--26: crowd-reader mummer; 31--32: hedge-rite acolyte; 33--34: picket captain; 35--36: ash-lantern warden; 41--42: smugglers' quartermaster; 43--44: bridge-lord's nephew; 45--46: psion novice; 51--52: syndicate fixer; 53--54: canal pilot; 55--56: inquisitor's clerk; 61--62: ex-legion drill; 63--64: dye house chemist; 65--66: caravan law clerk.

\subsection{Costs \& Ambitions}
\textbf{Costs:} wages; shares; favor; bribes; offerings; rest days; ritual purity; family duty.\\
\textbf{Ambitions:} vindication; mastery; homecoming; reform; riches; reputation; faith; revenge; discovery.

\subsection{Entanglements (roll 1--2 between sessions)}
Rival poaches a cohort; Auditor audits your Strings; a family claim interrupts a mission; Debtor calls; old oath resurfaces; festival duel challenge; informant flips; patrol biased; riot brewing in their home ward.

\section{Example of Play (short)}
\textbf{Scene:} The party needs a sealed ledger from the Archivolt. Their \emph{Specialist} (ledger-eye) \textbf{Delegates} to pull it during a playhouse feast. Position: \textbf{Dominant} (venue tags + String); Tier: \textbf{Veteran} (DV --1). Roll \emph{Wits+Investigation} to coordinate. Partial: ledger secured but \textbf{Morale +1}. A 1 shows $\to$ GM spends Social SB to start \textbf{Rumor [4]} about bribery.\\
Between sessions, the party's \textbf{Guild} runs two \textbf{Orders}: \emph{Audit} (to validate the ledger) and \emph{Bribe} (to cushion exposure). One hit, one partial: a \textbf{Project [6]} advances; \textbf{Exposure +1} ticks on the Guild. Next arc, the Specialist's \textbf{Agenda [4]} (protect guild loyalties) fills and they demand edits before release.

    \item \textbf{Licensed} (writ, seal) --- \emph{Broker/Petition} \textbf{DV --1} in scope of license.
    \item \textbf{Secret} (concealed use) --- first \emph{Expose} against you here starts \textbf{Desperate} for the attacker.
    \item \textbf{Crowd-Facing} (shop, theater) --- \emph{Audience tags} created here persist an extra scene.
    \item \textbf{Hazardous} (kilns, reagents) --- on 1s, GM may start \textbf{Accident [4]} instead of other SB spend.
    \item \textbf{Mobile} (barge/caravan) --- can act in adjacent districts without penalty.
    \item \textbf{Prestige} (old name, art) --- \emph{Petition} here \textbf{DV --1} with patricians; \emph{Blackmail} \textbf{+1 SB} against you if scandal hits.

    \item \textbf{Archive} --- \emph{Research/Expose} \textbf{DV --1} with proof assembled here.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{Integrity \& Resources}
  \begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Resources [6]} drop from upkeep, shocks, strikes; refill via Orders, scenes, or Projects. If Resources = 0, future Upkeep requires \textbf{Favor} or a concession clock.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \section{Asset Play}
  \subsection{Acting Through an Asset (On-Scene)}
  Stage a scene at or with an asset; apply its Tags and Strings to Position/DV like any venue. A named staffer may act as a \emph{Follower} or as a cohort (tick \textbf{Integrity} instead of Harm on failures).
  
  \subsection{Upkeep \& Yield (Each Cycle)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Upkeep:} Pay 1--2 of coin/favor/rite. If skipped: tick \textbf{Resources --1} and start \textbf{Creditor [4]} or \textbf{Inspection [4]}.
    \item \textbf{Yield:} If \textbf{Resources $\geq$ 3} and no active \textbf{Accident/Inspection}, gain one: coin, \textbf{Favor (narrow)}, \textbf{Clue}, or \textbf{Leverage (1)} themed to the asset.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{Asset Orders (Between Sessions)}
  Choose up to \textbf{2 orders} per session per asset (1 if Resources $\leq$ 2):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Operate:} generate Yield with risk (on 1s, tick \textbf{Heat +1} or \textbf{Integrity +1}).
    \item \textbf{Improve:} advance a \textbf{Project} [4--8].
    \item \textbf{Secure:} reduce \textbf{Heat --1} or add a \textbf{Security} tag for one scene.
    \item \textbf{Expand:} start a new Project to add a String (route, permit, office).
    \item \textbf{Audit:} convert one unspent Favor at this venue into \textbf{Standing (Tag)} after proof.
    \item \textbf{Exploit:} trade 1 \textbf{Integrity} for immediate coin + Favor; mark \textbf{Exposure +1} to someone.
  \end{itemize}
  \paragraph{Resolution} The directing PC rolls once per order (appropriate action). Tier/Tags adjust Position/DV. On hits, apply the order effect; on 1s, GM banks SB and hits Heat/Integrity/Exposure.
  
  \section{Campaign Continuity}
  \subsection{Asset Legacy System}
  Assets evolve and leave marks across campaigns through their \textbf{Legacy Notes}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reputation Effects:} Notorious (feared), Respected (trusted), Infamous (recognized), Legendary (historical significance)
    \item \textbf{Historical Events:} Siege Survived, Scandal Weathered, Expansion Completed, Crisis Averted
    \item \textbf{Relationship Changes:} Patron Gained/Lost, Rival Created/Resolved, Community Bond/Feud
    \item \textbf{Physical Evolution:} Renovated, Damaged, Expanded, Relocated
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{Legacy Benefits:} Assets with positive legacy gain +1 Resources or +1 Integrity at start of new campaigns.\\
  \textbf{Legacy Burdens:} Assets with negative legacy start with Heat +2 or Sanction +1 with relevant patrons.
  
  \subsection{Patron Relationship Continuity}
  Worldly Patron relationships persist with modified standing:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Active Patrons:} Reduce Tier by 1 but retain 1 Standing tag
    \item \textbf{Dormant Patrons:} Convert Tier to Favor Ledger entries; can be reactivated
    \item \textbf{Former Patrons:} Become Rivals [4] or Contacts [4] based on ending relationship
    \item \textbf{Legacy Patrons:} Historical figures whose mandates still influence current politics
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{Campaign Transition Events}
  At campaign end/beginning, roll for transition events:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Economic Shift (d6):} 1-2 Resources +1, 3-4 No change, 5-6 Resources -1
    \item \textbf{Political Change (d6):} 1-2 Gain new patron opportunity, 3-4 Status quo, 5-6 Lose a patron string
    \item \textbf{Physical Event (d6):} 1-2 Asset improves, 3-4 No change, 5-6 Asset takes Integrity -1
  \end{itemize}
  
  \section{Worldly Patrons}
  \subsection{Patron Sheet (Template)}

  \textbf{Stance toward PCs:} Allied / Wary / Hostile\\
  \textbf{Strings (3):} writs, permits, routes, rites, audiences\\
  \textbf{Boons:} what they can grant (seals, escorts, stipends, protection)\\

  \textbf{Mandate/Crisis Effects:} how their public wins/losses alter your Position/Exposure in their venues\\
  \textbf{Legacy Status:} Historical role, ongoing influence, campaign connections
  \end{framed}
  
  \subsection{Patron Tiers \& Benefits}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tier 0 --- Contact:} 1 \textbf{Audience}/session; one minor seal once.
    \item \textbf{Tier 1 --- Sponsor:} \textbf{+1 Position} once/scene in their venues; 1 \textbf{Stipend}/session (coin or permit access).
    \item \textbf{Tier 2 --- Patron:} cancel \textbf{one Social SB} per session in public; \textbf{DV --1} on \emph{Petition} to their offices; claim \textbf{Escort} once.
    \item \textbf{Tier 3 --- Protector:} start public scenes \textbf{Dominant} in their venues; \textbf{Endorsement} creates a 4-clock \emph{Bandwagon} on targets.
  \end{itemize}
  \paragraph{Advance a Tier} Hold \textbf{Standing} with them or convert \textbf{3 favors} into Standing and complete a \textbf{Patron Task [4--6]} on-screen.
  
  \subsection{Obligations \& Sanctions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Obligations:} tithe; keep scandal quiet; show at rites; take contracts; avoid rivals; uphold a doctrine. Skipping two cycles: tick \textbf{Sanction +1}.

    \item \textbf{Patron Exposure [6]:} Your public failures can tick this; at fill they \emph{distance} (Tier --1) or \emph{flip} to Hostile.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{Bargaining Procedure (Negotiation Scene)}
  \textbf{Frame:} what boon you want and what obligations you accept.\\
  \textbf{Set:} venue tags; your Reputation/Standing apply; use \emph{Petition/Broker/Expose}.\\
  \textbf{On hit:} gain the boon; write the Obligation and tick Favor Ledger $\pm$ as appropriate.\\
  \textbf{On 1s:} GM may add a secret clause, leak leverage, or start \textbf{Rival Patron [4]}.
  
  \subsection{Multiple Patrons}
  You may keep two active patrons without penalty. A third creates \textbf{Split Loyalty [4]}; on fill, one patron issues an ultimatum: choose, public denunciation, or give up a String.
  
  \section{Events, Audits, \& Market Shocks}
  Roll or draw 1--2 between sessions per active asset/patronage.

    \item \textbf{Favor Called:} a patron demands service; refuse $\to$ \textbf{Sanction +1}.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \section{Blueprints (Projects \& Upgrades)}

  \textbf{Scene --- Petition:} They seek a \emph{Tariff Exemption} for a festival barge. Position \textbf{Dominant} (Prestige + patron venue). DV 3. Strong hit: gain the boon; Favor Ledger +1; GM banks SB from a rolled 1 $\to$ \textbf{Rumor Run} starts.\\
  \textbf{Orders:} \emph{Operate} (yield coin; a 1 ticks Heat +1). \emph{Improve} (Archive Annex [6] +1 segment).\\
  \textbf{Event:} \textbf{Inspection [4]} begins. PCs \emph{Secure} next cycle; on a hit reduce Heat --1. A satirical Playhouse offers help for a cut---risking \textbf{Patron Exposure} if mocked.\\
  \textbf{Dilemma:} A rival \textbf{Patron} (Playhouse Guild) offers Tier 2 if they host a scandalous masque; \textbf{Split Loyalty [4]} begins. On fill, Bridge-Lords demand: cancel the masque or surrender \emph{Night Keys (String)}.\\
