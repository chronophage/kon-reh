\end{center}

\section*{Horror Campaign Design Philosophy}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=horrorbg]
\textbf{Horror in Fate's Edge should}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Create a sense of helplessness and mounting dread
\item Make players feel their characters are out of their depth
\item Use psychological tension as much as physical threat
\item Reward careful investigation and preparation
\item Punish reckless actions with lasting consequences
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Horror Elements}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Isolation}: Characters are cut off from help
\item \textbf{Unknown Threats}: The enemy cannot be easily understood or fought
\item \textbf{Psychological Decay}: Mental stability becomes as important as physical health
\item \textbf{Escalating Tension}: Fear builds throughout the campaign
\item \textbf{Moral Ambiguity}: Survival may require compromising principles
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\section*{The Sanity System}

\subsection*{Boon-Based Sanity Management}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=sanitybg]
\textbf{Sanity as Resource Management}: Instead of traditional sanity points, players must spend Boons to prevent the \textbf{Dread Clock} from advancing. This creates a resource management challenge where players must choose between immediate tactical advantages and long-term psychological stability.

\textbf{How It Works}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Each time a character witnesses something horrific or experiences genuine terror, the GM may advance the Dread Clock
\item Players can spend 1 Boon to prevent 1 segment of Dread Clock advancement
\item If the Dread Clock advances, the character suffers escalating psychological effects
\item Boons spent for sanity cannot be used for other purposes (rerolls, asset activation, XP conversion)
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\subsection*{The Dread Clock}

\begin{center}
\textbf{Dread Clock} (10 segments)\\
\fbox{\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment} 0/10\\
\textit{Psychological deterioration and mounting horror}
\end{center}

\textbf{Advancement Triggers} (GM spends Boons to prevent):
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Witnessing death or violence: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item Encountering the unknown: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item Personal failure leading to harm: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item Direct threat to sanity/morality: +2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\item Major revelation about the horror: +2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\item Companion/friend harmed or lost: +3 segments (prevent with 3 Boons)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Psychological Effects by Dread Level}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=*]
\item[0-2 Segments - Unease] Characters feel on edge, -1 die to social rolls involving trust, minor sleep disturbances
\item[3-4 Segments - Fear] -1 die to all rolls when alone, startle easily, avoid dark spaces, nightmares
\item[5-6 Segments - Terror] -2 dice to rolls involving courage or rational thought, may flee from non-threatening situations
\item[7-8 Segments - Madness] -2 dice to most rolls, may act against own interests, hallucinations, unreliable perception
\item[9-10 Segments - Broken] Out of control, may become hostile to allies, permanent psychological damage, requires major intervention to recover
\end{description}

\section*{Sample Horror Campaign: "The Whispering Dark"}

\subsection*{Campaign Hook}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=horrorbg]
\textbf{The Premise}: The PCs are investigators (scholars, agents, or simply curious individuals) who have been drawn to the remote mining town of Black Hollow in the Aelerian mountains. Miners have been disappearing, and those who return speak of whispers in the dark tunnels and shadows that move against the light. The local priest has fled, and the few remaining townspeople are on the verge of abandoning the settlement entirely.

\textbf{Real Hook}: The disappearances are connected to an ancient entity that was imprisoned beneath the mountain centuries ago. As the mining operations have deepened, they've disturbed the seals that keep it bound. Now it's beginning to awaken, and its influence is spreading through the town like a psychic contagion.
\end{mdframed}

\subsection*{Campaign Clocks}

\begin{center}
\textbf{Entity's Awakening Clock} (12 segments)\\
\fbox{\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment} 0/12\\
\textit{Progress toward the ancient entity's full manifestation}
\end{center}

\textbf{Advancement Triggers}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Mining operations continue: +1 segment per day
\item Seals investigated but not properly secured: +2 segments
\item PCs experience direct contact with entity: +3 segments
\item Townspeople driven to madness: +1 segment per person
\item Ancient rituals discovered but not understood: +2 segments
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\textbf{Town Collapse Clock} (8 segments)\\
\fbox{\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment} 0/8\\
\textit{How quickly the community breaks down under supernatural pressure}
\end{center}

\textbf{Advancement Triggers}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Dread Clock advances: +1 segment
\item Townspeople disappear or go mad: +1 segment each
\item PCs fail to provide leadership: +1 segment
\item Supernatural events witnessed by townsfolk: +2 segments
\item Essential services fail (doctor, supplies, communication): +1 segment
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\textbf{Dread Clock} (10 segments)\\
\fbox{\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment\clocksegment} 0/10\\
\textit{Psychological deterioration of investigators}
\end{center}

\textbf{Advancement Triggers} (Players can spend Boons to prevent):
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Discovering miners' fate: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item Hearing whispers in the dark: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item Seeing shadows move unnaturally: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item Finding evidence of entity's influence: +2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\item Companion shows signs of corruption: +2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\item Direct psychic attack from entity: +3 segments (prevent with 3 Boons)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Key NPCs}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=*]
\item[Marshal Elena Vasquez] The town's last law enforcement officer. Pragmatic but increasingly desperate. Knows something is wrong but can't admit the truth even to herself. Will sacrifice herself to protect the PCs if it means their escape.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Motivation}: Protect the innocent, maintain order
\item \textbf{Secret}: Found her deputy's remains with symbols carved into the bones
\item \textbf{Fate}: Becomes increasingly erratic, may need to be stopped
\end{itemize}

\item[Dr. Samuel Crowell] The town physician, arrived three months ago. Intellectual and curious, but his medical training is useless against supernatural threats. Has been documenting the psychological symptoms but doesn't understand their cause.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Motivation}: Understand and cure the "epidemic"
\item \textbf{Research}: Has compiled notes on psychological effects that could help PCs
\item \textbf{Weakness}: Becomes obsessed, may be corrupted by forbidden knowledge
\end{itemize}

\item[The Entity (Ancient in the Dark)] A being of pure malice that was imprisoned beneath the mountain by dwarven geomancers centuries ago. Cannot fully manifest but can influence minds and corrupt matter. Speaks through whispers and appears in peripheral vision.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Motivation}: Freedom and expansion of influence
\item \textbf{Method}: Corrupt individuals to do its bidding
\item \textbf{Weakness}: Bound by ancient seals, vulnerable to dwarven warding techniques
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsection*{Custom Horror Mechanics}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=sanitybg]
\textbf{Whispering Mechanic}: When in dark or enclosed spaces, PCs must make Wits + Perception rolls (DV 2) to resist hearing the entity's whispers. Each failure:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Generates 1 CP that the GM can spend for psychological effects
\item Advances Dread Clock by 1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item May reveal useful but disturbing information
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Shadow Sight}: When PCs are at 5+ Dread segments, they begin to see things that aren't there or notice details others miss:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item +1 die to Investigation rolls in familiar areas
\item But also see disturbing visions that generate 1 CP
\item May become unreliable narrators
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Corruption Spread}: PCs who reach 7+ Dread segments begin to show physical signs of the entity's influence:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Eyes that reflect unusual colors in darkness
\item Speaking in whispers without realizing it
\item Attraction to dark, enclosed spaces
\item May be able to communicate with the entity
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Group Sanity}: The party's collective Dread affects their ability to work together:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Average Dread level determines group cohesion
\item High average = paranoia, infighting, poor coordination
\item Low average = effective teamwork, shared resilience
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\subsection*{Sample Sessions}

\subsubsection*{Session 1: Arrival in Black Hollow}

\textbf{Opening Scene}: The PCs arrive to find the town eerily quiet. Most businesses are shuttered, and the few people they encounter are jumpy and unhelpful. The mine entrance is guarded by Marshal Vasquez, who warns them to leave.

\textbf{Key Encounters}:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Investigation of abandoned miner's cabin (Wits + Investigation)
\item Conversation with increasingly paranoid shopkeeper (Presence + Sway)
\item First encounter with whispers in the dark (Wits + Perception, DV 2)
\item Discovery of strange symbols carved near mine entrance
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Dread Clock Advancement}: 
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item First whisper encounter: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item Seeing abandoned, obviously terrified miner: +2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\item Discovering symbols that shouldn't exist: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Campaign Clock Advancement}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Entity's Awakening: +1 (mining operations continue unchecked)
\item Town Collapse: +1 (more townspeople decide to flee)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Session 2: Descent into Darkness}

\textbf{Key Encounters}:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Exploration of mine tunnels (Wits + Survival)
\item Encounter with corrupted miner (combat + social)
\item Discovery of ritual chamber deep underground (Wits + Lore)
\item First direct contact with entity's influence (Spirit + Resolve, DV 4)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Dread Clock Advancement}: 
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Seeing first corrupted miner: +2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\item Being touched by entity's influence: +3 segments (prevent with 3 Boons)
\item Discovering extent of corruption: +2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Campaign Clock Advancement}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Entity's Awakening: +2 (seals disturbed)
\item Town Collapse: +1 (miners don't return)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Session 3: The Truth Revealed}

\textbf{Key Encounters}:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Research in Dr. Crowell's notes (Wits + Lore)
\item Confrontation with Marshal Vasquez as she becomes erratic (Presence + Command)
\item Discovery of dwarven warding techniques (Wits + Arcana)
\item Choice: Attempt to reinforce seals or flee while there's still time
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Dread Clock Advancement}: 
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Learning the true nature of the entity: +3 segments (prevent with 3 Boons)
\item Witnessing Marshal's breakdown: +2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\item Realizing the scope of the threat: +2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Campaign Clock Advancement}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Entity's Awakening: +3 (major seal damaged)
\item Town Collapse: +2 (Marshal's authority breaks down)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Resolution Paths}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=*]
\item[The Sacrifice] Permanently seal the entity using dwarven techniques, but it requires one PC to remain behind as a living anchor. Success means the entity is contained, but at great personal cost. Award 15-18 XP.
\item[The Escape] Flee with evidence of the threat, warning other settlements. The entity remains but is contained for now. Award 10-12 XP, but create ongoing campaign thread. 
\item[The Corruption] Allow the entity to partially manifest, gaining its power but becoming its servants. Transform PCs into agents of horror. Award 8-10 XP but fundamentally change character nature.
\item[The Investigation] Fully understand the entity and find a way to banish it without sacrifice. Requires significant research and resources. Award 18-20 XP if successful, but very difficult.
\end{description}

\section*{Alternative Horror Mechanics}

\subsection*{Fear Tokens System}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=sanitybg]
\textbf{Fear Tokens}: Instead of spending Boons, players collect Fear Tokens when exposed to horror. These represent psychological trauma that can be spent for mechanical benefits but come with narrative costs.

\textbf{Gaining Fear Tokens}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Witnessing death or violence: 1 token
\item Direct threat to sanity: 2 tokens
\item Personal failure with consequences: 1 token
\item Major revelation: 2 tokens
\item Companion lost: 3 tokens
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Spending Fear Tokens}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item +1 die to rolls involving fear or intimidation: 1 token
\item Reroll a failed roll when acting recklessly: 2 tokens
\item Gain temporary immunity to a specific fear: 3 tokens
\item But each token spent increases Dread Clock by 1 segment
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Fear Manifestations}: As tokens accumulate, characters develop phobias and compulsions:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item 3+ tokens: -1 die in dark environments
\item 5+ tokens: Must make Wits + Resolve (DV 2) to enter confined spaces
\item 7+ tokens: Hallucinations that generate 1 CP per scene
\item 10+ tokens: Permanent psychological scar (narrative consequence)
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\subsection*{Breaking Point Mechanics}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=sanitybg]
\textbf{Breaking Points}: Specific triggers that force immediate Dread Clock advancement unless resisted.

\textbf{Common Breaking Points}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Witnessing Corruption}: Seeing a friend or ally become corrupted advances Dread by 2
\item \textbf{Personal Loss}: Losing something precious advances Dread by 3
\item \textbf{Moral Compromise}: Acting against core beliefs advances Dread by 2
\item \textbf{Hopelessness}: When all seems lost, advance Dread by 1 automatically
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Resistance}: Players can resist Breaking Points by:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Spending 2 Boons to prevent advancement
\item Making Spirit + Resolve roll (DV 3) with narrative justification
\item Having relevant Talents or Backgrounds that provide resistance
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Consequences of Breaking}: When a Breaking Point occurs:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Character gains a permanent personality shift
\item May temporarily become unreliable or hostile
\item Creates new complications for the party
\item May unlock new information about the horror
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\section*{Horror Campaign Templates}

\end{mdframed}

\subsection*{Cosmic Horror Campaign: "The Infinite Spiral"}

\subsubsection*{Campaign Hook}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=horrorbg]
\textbf{The Premise}: The PCs are scholars, researchers, or investigators who have been drawn to the remote Aelerian Observatory at Khaz-Vurim, where astronomers have detected impossible stellar phenomena. Stars are moving in patterns that violate every known law of physics, and observers report seeing geometric shapes in the void that hurt to perceive directly.

\textbf{Real Hook}: The stellar anomalies are caused by a rift in the fabric of reality itself, created by ancient Aeler experiments into dimensional mathematics. Something from beyond the normal dimensions is seeping through, and its alien geometry is slowly rewriting the fundamental laws of existence in this region of space.
\end{mdframed}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Key NPCs}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=*]
\item[Master Astronomer Thane Ironwright] The dwarven head of the observatory. Brilliant but increasingly paranoid as stellar phenomena defy explanation. Knows more about the Aeler experiments than he admits.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Motivation}: Preserve the integrity of astronomical knowledge
\item \textbf{Secret}: Discovered the Aeler connection but fears the consequences of revelation
\item \textbf{Fate}: May become a conduit for cosmic influence or the key to sealing the rift
\end{itemize}

\item[Scholar Elena Vasquez] A human mathematician studying the impossible equations. Young and ambitious, but her research is driving her toward madness.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Motivation}: Solve the greatest mathematical mystery in history
\item \textbf{Research}: Has calculated patterns that predict reality fractures
\item \textbf{Weakness}: Becoming obsessed, may willingly open dimensional gates
\end{itemize}

\item[The Entity (Beyond the Void)] An alien intelligence from outside normal space-time. Cannot fully manifest but can influence reality through mathematical resonance. Speaks through impossible equations and appears as geometric impossibilities.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Motivation}: Understand and reshape reality according to alien logic
\item \textbf{Method}: Corrupt mathematical understanding to break dimensional barriers
\item \textbf{Weakness}: Bound by logical consistency, vulnerable to paradox and contradiction
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsection*{Custom Horror Mechanics}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=sanitybg]
\textbf{Geometric Perception}: When PCs observe alien geometry or impossible stellar patterns, they must make Wits + Lore rolls (DV 3) to avoid comprehension effects. Each failure:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Generates 2 CP that the GM can spend for reality distortions
\item Advances Dread Clock by 2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\item May grant forbidden knowledge at great psychological cost
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Temporal Distortion}: As reality fractures, time becomes unreliable:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item +1 die to Investigation rolls for finding temporal anomalies
\item But also experience time loops that generate 2 CP
\item May become unstuck in time, unreliable narrators
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dimensional Bleed}: PCs who reach 7+ Dread segments begin to exist partially outside normal space:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Can perceive multiple dimensional layers simultaneously
\item Speaking in mathematical equations without realizing it
\item Attraction to impossible geometric patterns
\item May be able to perceive the entity directly
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Collective Insanity}: The party's collective Dread affects their perception of reality:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Average Dread level determines reality stability
\item High average = shared hallucinations, impossible events become real
\item Low average = grounding effect, some resistance to cosmic influence
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\subsection*{Sample Sessions}

\subsubsection*{Session 1: Arrival at Khaz-Vurim}

\textbf{Opening Scene}: The PCs arrive at the dwarven observatory to find the astronomers in a state of controlled panic. Stars are moving in impossible patterns, and some have simply vanished from the sky. The Master Astronomer is holding emergency sessions to discuss the phenomena.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Reality Fracture: +3 (major dimensional barrier weakened)
\item Collective Sanity: +3 (observatory staff affected)
\item Existential Threat: +2 (entity closer to manifestation)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Resolution Paths}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=*]
\item[The Paradox Seal] Use contradictory mathematical principles to create a logical paradox that forces the entity back beyond dimensional barriers. Success seals the rift but leaves the PCs with fragmented understanding of reality. Award 15-18 XP.
\item[The Sacrificial Equation] Permanently bind oneself to the dimensional rift as an anchor to keep it stable. The PC becomes a living mathematical constant, existing partially outside normal reality but preventing the entity's full manifestation. Award 18-20 XP but fundamentally change character nature.
\item[The Embrace of Infinity] Accept the entity's influence and allow it to rewrite reality according to alien logic. The PCs become heralds of a new cosmic order, gaining vast power but losing their humanity and connection to normal existence. Award 8-10 XP but transform PCs into agents of cosmic horror.
\item[The Fractal Escape] Use the entity's own geometric principles against it, creating a recursive pattern that traps it in an infinite loop of self-reference. Requires significant mathematical understanding and risks fractal contamination. Award 20-22 XP if successful, but very difficult.

\subsection*{Cosmic Horror Mechanics}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=sanitybg]
\textbf{Reality Distortion Points}: Instead of spending Boons, players can accumulate Reality Distortion Points when exposed to cosmic horror. These represent fundamental changes to their perception of reality that can be spent for mechanical benefits but come with narrative costs.

\textbf{Gaining Reality Distortion Points}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Witnessing stellar impossibilities: 1 point
\item Direct contact with alien geometry: 2 points
\item Comprehending higher-dimensional mathematics: 2 points
\item Experiencing temporal distortions: 1 point
\item Partial manifestation of cosmic entity: 3 points
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Spending Reality Distortion Points}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item +1 die to rolls involving mathematical or geometric understanding: 1 point
\item Perceive hidden dimensional layers: 2 points
\item Gain temporary immunity to reality distortions: 3 points
\item But each point spent increases Dread Clock by 1 segment
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cosmic Manifestations}: As points accumulate, characters develop alien perceptions and abilities:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item 3+ points: -1 die in normal three-dimensional environments
\item 5+ points: Must make Wits + Resolve (DV 2) to interact with normal reality
\item 7+ points: Can perceive multiple timeline branches, but generates 2 CP per scene
\item 10+ points: Permanent reality distortion (narrative consequence)
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\subsection*{Cosmic Breaking Points}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=sanitybg]
\textbf{Cosmic Breaking Points}: Specific triggers that force immediate Dread Clock advancement unless resisted through cosmic understanding.

\textbf{Common Cosmic Breaking Points}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Incomprehensible Truth}: Understanding a fact that fundamentally challenges reality advances Dread by 3
\item \textbf{Dimensional Witness}: Seeing the entity directly advances Dread by 4
\item \textbf{Mathematical Corruption}: Having one's core understanding of mathematics altered advances Dread by 3
\item \textbf{Temporal Fracture}: Experiencing personal timeline disruption advances Dread by 2
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Resistance}: Players can resist Cosmic Breaking Points by:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Spending 3 Boons to prevent advancement
\item Making Spirit + Lore roll (DV 4) with narrative justification involving mathematical or cosmic understanding
\item Having relevant Talents or Backgrounds that provide resistance to reality distortion
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Consequences of Cosmic Breaking}: When a Cosmic Breaking Point occurs:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Character gains a permanent alien perception
\item May temporarily become unreliable or exist partially outside normal time
\item Creates new complications for the party through reality distortions
\item May unlock forbidden cosmic knowledge
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\end{mdframed}

\subsection*{The Investigation}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=sanitybg]
\textbf{Whispering Investigation}: When investigating areas where whispers have been heard, PCs must make Wits + Investigation rolls (DV 2) to avoid being overwhelmed by the entity's influence. Each failure:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Generates 1 CP that can be spent for entity manifestations
\item Advances Dread Clock by 1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item May reveal crucial but disturbing clues
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Forbidden Knowledge}: Researching the entity through ancient tomes or speaking with knowledgeable NPCs carries risks:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Each research attempt requires Spirit + Lore (DV 3)
\item Success grants valuable information but advances Dread Clock by 1
\item Failure generates 2 CP and advances Dread Clock by 2
\item Critical failure may result in direct entity contact
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\section*{GM Tips for Running Horror Campaigns}

\subsection*{Atmosphere and Tension}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=horrorbg]
\textbf{Building Dread}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Use lighting, sound, and physical environment to create unease
\item Describe sensations and feelings, not just visual details
\item Let silences and pauses carry weight
\item Make the familiar seem alien and threatening
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pacing the Horror}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Start subtle and build gradually
\item Vary the intensity - allow moments of false security
\item Use foreshadowing and ominous signs
\item Save the biggest revelations for climactic moments
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Player Agency}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Give players meaningful choices, even when options seem limited
\item Let their decisions have real consequences
\item Provide multiple approaches to problems
\item Respect their courage to face the horror head-on
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\subsection*{Managing Fear and Sanity}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=sanitybg]
\textbf{Fear as a Resource}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Fear should be a narrative driver, not a punishment
\item Let players feel powerful even when afraid
\item Provide opportunities to confront and overcome fears
\item Balance terror with moments of triumph
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sanity Management}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Make sanity loss feel meaningful and personal
\item Let it change how characters perceive and interact with the world
\item Provide ways to recover or adapt to mental trauma
\item Avoid making characters useless when sanity is low
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\subsection*{Narrative Techniques}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=horrorbg]
\textbf{Unreliable Information}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Not all sources are trustworthy
\item Clues may be misleading or incomplete
\item NPCs might be lying, mistaken, or hiding crucial information
\item Let players discover the truth through investigation and deduction
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Unknown vs. The Known}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item The unknown should be terrifying because of what it might be
\item Revelations should be both satisfying and horrifying
\item Partial knowledge can be more unsettling than complete ignorance
\item Let mystery be part of the horror
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\section*{Sample Horror Items and Relics}

\subsection*{Cursed Artifacts}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=*]
\item[Whispering Blade] A dagger that hums with voices inaudible to most. Wielder gains +1 die to stealth and investigation rolls but must make Spirit + Resolve (DV 2) each session or advance Dread Clock by 1.
\item[Mirror of the Forgotten] Shows glimpses of possible futures and past events. Provides valuable insights (Wits + Lore, DV 2) but each use advances Dread Clock by 1 and generates 1 CP.
\item[Shroud of Whispers] A burial cloth that grants immunity to fear effects but causes the wearer to hear the entity's whispers constantly. Must make Wits + Perception (DV 3) or advance Dread Clock by 2 each day worn.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Protective Items}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=*]
\item[Blessed Warding Stone] Provides +2 dice to resist supernatural influence and reduces Dread Clock advancement by 1 (minimum 1). Crumbles to dust if Dread Clock fills completely.
\item[Sanctified Salt] Can be used to create protective circles or barriers. One use per session to prevent Dread Clock advancement or gain start Controlled vs. supernatural threats.
\item[Prayer Book of the Steadfast] Once per session, allows reroll of failed Spirit + Resolve roll and prevents 1 segment of Dread Clock advancement.
\end{description}

\section*{Conclusion}

Horror in Fate's Edge is about creating a sense of vulnerability and mounting dread while still allowing players to feel their characters are capable of meaningful action. The sanity system provides mechanical weight to psychological horror, while the campaign clocks ensure that tension builds naturally throughout the story.

Remember that the best horror comes from what is left unsaid and unseen. Let the players' imaginations fill in the gaps, and trust in the power of implication over explicit description. The fear of what might be lurking in the shadows is often more effective than showing every monster in detail.

Most importantly, maintain communication with your players about comfort levels and boundaries. Horror can be deeply personal, and what one player finds thrilling, another might find genuinely distressing. A good horror game is one where everyone at the table is having fun and feeling appropriately challenged, not traumatized.

The mechanics provided here are tools to enhance the horror experience, not replace good storytelling and atmosphere. Use them to support your narrative goals and create memorable, chilling experiences for your players.

\item If any Ace appears, add a fundamental law of reality that becomes unreliable (time flows backward, gravity weakens, etc.)
\item Face cards represent cosmic entities or phenomena beyond normal comprehension
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Using the Cosmic Horror Generator}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=horrorbg]
\textbf{Standalone Campaign Use}:
When using the Cosmic Horror generator on its own, focus on reality-breaking threats that challenge the fundamental nature of existence. The generator provides a complete framework for campaigns where the PCs face threats beyond normal comprehension.

\textbf{Key Considerations}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Scale}: Cosmic horror operates on a universal or existential scale rather than personal threats
\item \textbf{Comprehension}: Understanding the threat may be as dangerous as ignoring it
\item \textbf{Permanence}: Changes to reality may be irreversible
\item \textbf{Isolation}: The PCs may be among the few who perceive the true threat
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Standalone Setup}:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Draw the full seed (Spade, Heart, Club, Diamond) to establish the cosmic threat
\item Note any Aces for fundamental reality changes
\item Use Face cards to identify cosmic entities involved
\item Set primary clock based on highest rank
\item Establish 2-3 supporting clocks (Reality Fracture, Collective Sanity, Existential Threat)
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=sanitybg]
\textbf{Mixed Generator Use}:
The Cosmic Horror generator excels at adding existential weight to other campaign types. Mix it with regional generators to create campaigns where local threats have cosmic implications.

\textbf{Common Mixing Strategies}:

\textbf{With Mistlands}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Use Mistlands Spades/Clubs for atmospheric horror
\item Use Cosmic Hearts/Diamonds for the underlying threat
\item Result: Ancient entities sleeping beneath the mist, awakened by reality fractures
\end{itemize}

\textbf{With Acasia}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Use Acasia Spades/Clubs for cursed locations and social pressure
\item Use Cosmic Hearts/Diamonds for the true threat behind local disturbances
\item Result: Merchant houses unknowingly trafficking in reality-distorting artifacts
\end{itemize}

\textbf{With Aeler}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Use Aeler Spades/Clubs for underground locations and ancient dangers
\item Use Cosmic Hearts/Diamonds for the vault-dwelling entities
\item Result: Dwarven experiments that opened doors to impossible dimensions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{With Valewood}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Use Valewood Spades/Clubs for phasing ruins and imperial residue
\item Use Cosmic Hearts/Diamonds for the entities behind the empire's fall
\item Result: The empire fell not to war, but to reality-altering influence
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mixing Procedure}:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Draw 2-3 cards from base generator (location, local actor, local pressure)
\item Draw 1-2 cards from Cosmic Horror generator (cosmic entity, reality threat)
\item Blend elements to create a threat that feels both local and universal
\item Use base generator's clock size, modified by cosmic elements
\item Add 1-2 cosmic-themed supporting clocks to base campaign clocks
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=horrorbg]
\textbf{Campaign Integration Tips}:

\textbf{Gradual Revelation}:
Start with local/normal threats, gradually revealing cosmic implications. Players are more invested when they discover their small problem is part of a universal threat.

\textbf{Personal Stakes}:
Even cosmic threats need personal connections. Tie the existential danger to characters' backgrounds, goals, or loved ones.

\textbf{Escalation Patterns}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Sessions 1-2: Local anomalies, minor reality distortions
\item Sessions 3-4: Pattern recognition, first contact with cosmic entities
\item Sessions 5-6: Full revelation, existential stakes become clear
\item Final Session: Resolution with universal consequences
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reality as Character}:
Treat the laws of physics and fundamental reality as active elements that can shift, change, and react to player actions. When players solve problems, let reality itself respond.

\textbf{Knowledge Management}:
Forbidden knowledge should be both valuable and dangerous. Create systems where learning the truth advances both understanding and threat levels.
\end{mdframed}

\subsection*{Mixed Deck Campaign: "The Whispering Depths" (Mistlands + Cosmic Horror)}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=horrorbg]
\textbf{Campaign Setup}:
Mixing the Mistlands generator with Cosmic Horror creates a campaign where ancient entities sleeping beneath the fog have begun to awaken as reality barriers weaken.

\textbf{Drawn Elements}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Mistlands Spade (7 - Pall Watch-tower on piles above the mire)
\item Cosmic Horror Heart (Q - Cosmic entity that communicates through stellar movements)
\item Mistlands Club (9 - Bell-line failure on the levee; a wraith steps across like it owns the road)
\item Cosmic Horror Diamond (8 - Instrument that can detect fluctuations in the fundamental constants)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Clock Size}: 9 (Queen) = 8-segment primary clock

\textbf{Campaign Hook}:
The Pall Watch-tower, a key defensive position in the Mistlands, has begun experiencing temporal anomalies. Guards report that the bell-line failures don't follow normal patterns—instead, the bells ring in mathematical sequences that correspond to stellar movements visible only through the tower's ancient spyglass. Something from beyond normal space is using the weakened barriers between dimensions to influence the physical world, and the bell-code system that once kept the Mistlands safe is now serving as a communication channel for entities that predate human civilization.

\textbf{Key NPCs}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Bell-Warden Thorne: Paranoid keeper who first noticed the anomalous bell patterns
\item Astronomer-Liaison Mara: Assigned to interpret the stellar correlations, slowly losing sanity
\item The Deep Listener: Cosmic entity that exists partially in our dimension, communicating through bell harmonics
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Campaign Clocks}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Bell-Line Corruption (8): How much the communication system has been compromised
\item Reality Fracture (10): Local weakening of dimensional barriers
\item Collective Sanity (8): Mental stability of the watch-tower garrison
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Resolution Paths}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Seal the dimensional breach using the stellar-aligned bell-code in reverse
\item Negotiate with the entity to establish a controlled communication channel
\item Destroy the watch-tower to sever the connection, sacrificing the region's defense
\item Allow the entity full access to our reality in exchange for protection from other cosmic threats
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Horror Elements}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item The bells ring in patterns that hurt to hear directly
\item Guards begin aging rapidly during their watches
\item Shadows cast by the tower show events from impossible futures
\item The entity's influence causes time to loop in 8-hour cycles
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}
