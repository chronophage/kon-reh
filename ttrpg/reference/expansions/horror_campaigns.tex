\section{Horror Campaigns Expansion Overview}

\subsection{Core Concept}

Horror in Fate's Edge should create vulnerability and mounting dread while maintaining player agency and meaningful action. The unknown is more terrifying than the known.

\subsection{Key Innovations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Boon-based sanity management system
\item Multi-layered campaign clocks for escalating tension
\item Breaking point mechanics for critical psychological moments
\item Atmospheric investigation tools engaging all five senses
\item Modular subgenre templates for quick campaign setup
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Target Themes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Isolation and vulnerability
\item Unknown threats beyond comprehension
\item Psychological decay and mental deterioration
\item Escalating tension throughout campaigns
\item Moral ambiguity and difficult choices
\item Cosmic insignificance and existential dread
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mechanical Focus}

\begin{itemize}
\item Resource management through Boon economy
\item Investigative procedures with sanity costs
\item Environmental hazards and reality distortions
\item Collective psychological effects
\item Multi-clock tension building systems
\end{itemize}

\section{Core Mechanical Framework}

\subsection{Dread Clock - Sanity as Resource Management}

The signature system replaces traditional sanity points with a Boon-based approach where players must spend resources to prevent psychological deterioration.

\begin{mechanic}{Purpose and Integration}
This system connects to the existing Boon economy while adding horror-specific tension through the multi-clock system. Players choose when to spend Boons to prevent Dread advancement, creating meaningful decisions about risk versus stability.
\end{mechanic}

\textbf{Sample Uses:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Witnessing a Mist Wraith causes +1 segment advancement - player spends 1 Boon to prevent it
\item Learning cosmic truth about reality triggers +3 segments - player must spend 3 Boons or face severe psychological effects
\item Entity observation advances Dread by 2 segments - party must collectively decide how to manage limited Boon resources
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Resource Management - Boons as Sanity Currency}

\textbf{Acquisition Methods:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Failing rolls (standard Boon economy)
\item Bond-driven actions with intricate descriptions
\item GM discretion for thematic play
\item Session participation and milestone achievements
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Spending Options:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Preventing Dread Clock advancement
\item Rerolling dice for critical actions
\item Activating protective assets and items
\item Converting to XP (max 2 per session)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Narrative Weight:} Players must choose between immediate tactical advantages and long-term psychological stability.

\subsection{Risk/Reward Balance}

\textbf{Safe Choices:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Surface-level investigation with minimal horror exposure
\item Conservative approach with reduced Boon economy (-1 die penalties)
\item Avoiding direct confrontation with unknown threats
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Risky Choices:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Deep investigation with significant horror exposure
\item Direct engagement with incomprehensible entities
\item Pursuing forbidden knowledge at personal cost
\item +1-3 Dread segments, potential breaking points
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Failure States:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Dread Clock fills completely
\item Character becomes Broken - out of control, hostile to allies
\item Permanent psychological damage requiring intervention
\item Transformation into agent of horror
\end{itemize}

\section{Campaign Clock Framework}

\subsection{Primary Clock: Dread Clock (10 segments)}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tableheader}
\textbf{Dread Clock} & \textbf{Psychological deterioration and mounting horror} \\
\hline
Segments & \textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet 0/10 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Advancement Triggers:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Witnessing death or violence: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item Encountering the unknown: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item Personal failure leading to harm: +1 segment (prevent with 1 Boon)
\item Direct threat to sanity/morality: +2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\item Major revelation about the horror: +2 segments (prevent with 2 Boons)
\item Companion/friend harmed or lost: +3 segments (prevent with 3 Boons)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Consequences when filled:} Character becomes Broken - out of control, may become hostile to allies, permanent psychological damage, requires major intervention to recover.

\subsection{Secondary Clocks}

\subsubsection{Reality Fracture Clock (12 segments)}

How much fundamental laws of reality have been altered by cosmic influence.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tableheader}
\textbf{Reality Fracture Clock} & \textbf{Fundamental laws of reality becoming unreliable} \\
\hline
Segments & \textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet 0/12 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Advancement Triggers:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Impossible phenomena observed: +1 segment per day
\item Dimensional mathematics researched: +2 segments
\item PCs directly perceive alien geometry: +3 segments
\item Local reality becomes unstable: +2 segments per incident
\item Ancient experiments disturbed: +3 segments
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Consequences when filled:} Barriers between dimensions collapse completely; entity manifests fully in normal space.

\subsubsection{Collective Sanity Clock (8 segments)}

How much the party and observers are affected by cosmic horror.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tableheader}
\textbf{Collective Sanity Clock} & \textbf{Group psychological effects and shared hallucinations} \\
\hline
Segments & \textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet 0/8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Advancement Triggers:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reality Fracture Clock advances: +1 segment
\item Direct observation of alien entities: +2 segments each
\item Comprehension of higher-dimensional concepts: +2 segments
\item Witnessing impossible geometric shapes: +1 segment each
\item Temporal anomalies experienced: +1 segment per hour
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Consequences when filled:} Shared hallucinations become reality; party exists partially outside normal space.

\subsubsection{Existential Threat Clock (15 segments)}

How close cosmic entity is to full manifestation in our reality.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tableheader}
\textbf{Existential Threat Clock} & \textbf{Cosmic entity approaching full manifestation} \\
\hline
Segments & \textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet 0/15 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Advancement Triggers:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reality Fracture reaches 6 segments: +2 segments
\item Collective Sanity reaches 6 segments: +3 segments
\item PCs attempt to communicate with alien intelligence: +3 segments
\item Dimensional barriers weakened further: +2 segments
\item Ancient safeguards fail: +4 segments
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Consequences when filled:} Entity begins reshaping local reality according to alien logic.

\subsection{Clock Interaction}

Reality Fracture drives other clocks; as it advances, Collective Sanity and Existential Threat accelerate. High Collective Sanity makes Reality Fracture advance faster as perception warps reality.

\subsection*{Quick Use Notes}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage
\item Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10)
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (knowledge/tools) that change position rather than call for a roll
\item If any Ace appears, add a fundamental law of reality that becomes unreliable (time flows backward, gravity weakens, etc.)
\item Face cards represent cosmic entities or phenomena beyond normal comprehension
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Using the Cosmic Horror Generator}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=shadecolor]
\textbf{Standalone Campaign Use}:
When using the Cosmic Horror generator on its own, focus on reality-breaking threats that challenge the fundamental nature of existence. The generator provides a complete framework for campaigns where the PCs face threats beyond normal comprehension.

\textbf{Key Considerations}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Scale}: Cosmic horror operates on a universal or existential scale rather than personal threats
\item \textbf{Comprehension}: Understanding the threat may be as dangerous as ignoring it
\item \textbf{Permanence}: Changes to reality may be irreversible
\item \textbf{Isolation}: The PCs may be among the few who perceive the true threat
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Standalone Setup}:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Draw the full seed (Spade, Heart, Club, Diamond) to establish the cosmic threat
\item Note any Aces for fundamental reality changes
\item Use Face cards to identify cosmic entities involved
\item Set primary clock based on highest rank
\item Establish 2-3 supporting clocks (Reality Fracture, Collective Sanity, Existential Threat)
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=tableheader]
\textbf{Mixed Generator Use}:
The Cosmic Horror generator excels at adding existential weight to other campaign types. Mix it with regional generators to create campaigns where local threats have cosmic implications.

\textbf{Common Mixing Strategies}:

\textbf{With Mistlands}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Use Mistlands Spades/Clubs for atmospheric horror
\item Use Cosmic Hearts/Diamonds for the underlying threat
\item Result: Ancient entities sleeping beneath the mist, awakened by reality fractures
\end{itemize}

\textbf{With Acasia}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Use Acasia Spades/Clubs for cursed locations and social pressure
\item Use Cosmic Hearts/Diamonds for the true threat behind local disturbances
\item Result: Merchant houses unknowingly trafficking in reality-distorting artifacts
\end{itemize}

\textbf{With Aeler}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Use Aeler Spades/Clubs for underground locations and ancient dangers
\item Use Cosmic Hearts/Diamonds for the vault-dwelling entities
\item Result: Dwarven experiments that opened doors to impossible dimensions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{With Valewood}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Use Valewood Spades/Clubs for phasing ruins and imperial residue
\item Use Cosmic Hearts/Diamonds for the entities behind the empire's fall
\item Result: The empire fell not to war, but to reality-altering influence
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mixing Procedure}:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Draw 2-3 cards from base generator (location, local actor, local pressure)
\item Draw 1-2 cards from Cosmic Horror generator (cosmic entity, reality threat)
\item Blend elements to create a threat that feels both local and universal
\item Use base generator's clock size, modified by cosmic elements
\item Add 1-2 cosmic-themed supporting clocks to base campaign clocks
\end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=shadecolor]
\textbf{Campaign Integration Tips}:

\textbf{Gradual Revelation}:
Start with local/normal threats, gradually revealing cosmic implications. Players are more invested when they discover their small problem is part of a universal threat.

\textbf{Personal Stakes}:
Even cosmic threats need personal connections. Tie the existential danger to characters' backgrounds, goals, or loved ones.

\textbf{Escalation Patterns}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Sessions 1-2: Local anomalies, minor reality distortions
\item Sessions 3-4: Pattern recognition, first contact with cosmic entities
\item Sessions 5-6: Full revelation, existential stakes become clear
\item Final Session: Resolution with universal consequences
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reality as Character}:
Treat the laws of physics and fundamental reality as active elements that can shift, change, and react to player actions. When players solve problems, let reality itself respond.

\textbf{Knowledge Management}:
Forbidden knowledge should be both valuable and dangerous. Create systems where learning the truth advances both understanding and threat levels.
\end{mdframed}

\subsection*{Mixed Deck Campaign: "The Whispering Depths" (Mistlands + Cosmic Horror)}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=shadecolor]
\textbf{Campaign Setup}:
Mixing the Mistlands generator with Cosmic Horror creates a campaign where ancient entities sleeping beneath the fog have begun to awaken as reality barriers weaken.

\textbf{Drawn Elements}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Mistlands Spade (7 - Pall Watch-tower on piles above the mire)
\item Cosmic Horror Heart (Q - Cosmic entity that communicates through stellar movements)
\item Mistlands Club (9 - Bell-line failure on the levee; a wraith steps across like it owns the road)
\item Cosmic Horror Diamond (8 - Instrument that can detect fluctuations in the fundamental constants)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Clock Size}: 9 (Queen) = 8-segment primary clock

\textbf{Campaign Hook}:
The Pall Watch-tower, a key defensive position in the Mistlands, has begun experiencing temporal anomalies. Guards report that the bell-line failures don't follow normal patterns—instead, the bells ring in mathematical sequences that correspond to stellar movements visible only through the tower's ancient spyglass. Something from beyond normal space is using the weakened barriers between dimensions to influence the physical world, and the bell-code system that once kept the Mistlands safe is now serving as a communication channel for entities that predate human civilization.

\textbf{Key NPCs}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Bell-Warden Thorne: Paranoid keeper who first noticed the anomalous bell patterns
\item Astronomer-Liaison Mara: Assigned to interpret the stellar correlations, slowly losing sanity
\item The Deep Listener: Cosmic entity that exists partially in our dimension, communicating through bell harmonics
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Campaign Clocks}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Bell-Line Corruption (8): How much the communication system has been compromised
\item Reality Fracture (10): Local weakening of dimensional barriers
\item Collective Sanity (8): Mental stability of the watch-tower garrison
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Resolution Paths}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Seal the dimensional breach using the stellar-aligned bell-code in reverse
\item Negotiate with the entity to establish a controlled communication channel
\item Destroy the watch-tower to sever the connection, sacrificing the region's defense
\item Allow the entity full access to our reality in exchange for protection from other cosmic threats
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Horror Elements}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item The bells ring in patterns that hurt to hear directly
\item Guards begin aging rapidly during their watches
\item Shadows cast by the tower show events from impossible futures
\item The entity's influence causes time to loop in 8-hour cycles
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\section{Conclusion}

This Horror Campaigns expansion and clock generator system provides GMs with flexible, thematically coherent tools for running horror campaigns of any scope while maintaining the mechanical elegance and player agency that defines Fate's Edge. Whether running a single-session haunted house scenario or an extended cosmic horror campaign, these tools ensure that horror remains personal, consequential, and mechanically integrated with the core Fate's Edge experience.

Remember that the best horror emerges from player investment in their characters and the world around them. Use these mechanical tools to support narrative tension and emotional investment, not replace them. The fear of what might be lurking in the shadows is often more effective than showing every monster in detail, and the psychological consequences of player choices should feel meaningful and lasting.

\begin{center}
\textbf{In the spaces between certainty and chaos, in the whispers of the unknown, and in the breaking points of human endurance, the truth waits patiently. Will you listen? Will you pay the price? Will you survive to tell the tale?}
\end{center}
