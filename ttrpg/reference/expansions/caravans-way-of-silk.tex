{\LARGE \textbf{Caravans: Way of Silk}} \\
\vspace{0.5em}
{\large (Fate's Edge v0.1)} \\
\vspace{1em}
A plug-and-play module for long-haul trade, escort, and diplomacy across the Violet Steppe/Meadows and deserts toward Sihai and Dhahara. Built to run caravans of Fhara, Tulkani, Ashaani, Dhaharan, and Kuvani traders.
\end{center}

\section*{Design Goals}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Convoy as character. A caravan has strings, tags, and clocks that bite back.
\item From road to court. Scenes flow between trail hazards, border posts, and negotiation halls.
\item Low bookkeeping. Track a few clocks (Distance, Danger, Supplies, Morale); let strings and orders do the heavy lifting.
\item Use the core. Keep Position/DV, SB, clocks, Favor/Leverage/Exposure, Strings. No new dice math.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Quickstart (2 minutes)}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Make a Caravan Sheet (\S1) with Supplies [6], Morale [6], Condition [6], Heat [6] (optional) and 1--3 Strings (writs, water shares, waymarks).
\item Pick a Route Leg (\S2) and mark Distance [4--8] and Danger [4--6]. Note Terrain and Season.
\item Assign Roles to PCs/followers (\S3). Choose an Intent Dial for the leg: Speed / Stealth / Show.
\item Run scenes from the Caravan Deck (\S6) and from fiction. All 1s generate SB; spend city/road flavored Social SB (\S5.4).
\item End of Leg: Pay Upkeep, adjust tracks, trade at market, and advance projects/patrons.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Caravan Sheet (Template)}

\begin{tabular}{|p{\textwidth}|}
\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Caravan Tags (pick 2--4)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Fast Teams (steppe ponies, spare yokes): Start Speed legs one Position higher.
\item Heavy Wagons (armored sides): Expose/Rob against you starts one Position worse.
\item Long Train (many clients): +1 Bandwidth, but a 1 on Operate may tick Heat +1 (gossip).
\item Shrine-Banner (oath to a road-saint): Once/leg, Host Rite starts Dominant; breaking rites adds Exposure +1.
\item Smuggler Compartments (false floors): Smuggle DV --1; on 1s, start Contraband Trail [4].
\item Scout Eyes (trained outriders): Survey/Track DV --1 on open ground.
\item Riverwise (barges/rafts carried/leased): Treat a canal/ford as neutral ground; Chase (boat) DV --1.
\item Caravan Doc (apothecary wagon): Once/leg clear one minor Harm or tick Morale +1 after a rest scene.
\item Ward-Woven Tents (sigils): Infiltrate against camp starts one Position worse.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Beasts \& Wagons (examples)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Steppe Travois: capacity 1; tag Fast; fragile in rocks.
\item Desert Camels: capacity 2; tag Water-wise (Supplies loss --1 on drought checks once/leg).
\item Dray Lizards: capacity 3; tag Sure-footed (mountains DV --1) but Hungry (Supplies --1 if a 1 shows in a danger scene).
\item Covered Wagon: capacity 3; tag Shelter (Weather starts one Position higher).
\end{itemize}

\section{Route \& Leg Structure}

A Route is made of Legs (days/weeks) between safe stops.

\subsection{Set a Leg}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Distance [4--8]: how many progress segments to reach the next safe stop.
\item Danger [4--6]: the leg's ambient pressure (raiders, terrain, ward-storms). GM advances on 1s or when fiction dictates.
\item Terrain: steppe • desert • mountain pass • river flats • saltpan • reedmarsh.
\item Season/Weather Clock [4--6]: rains • dust winds • fog • heat wave • freeze.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pre-Leg Intent \& Roles}

Pick one Intent Dial (it sets default Position for travel scenes):
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Speed: make Distance faster; Broker/Petition at stops start one Position worse (rushed).
\item Stealth: avoid Danger; Distance advances only on strong hits.
\item Show: parade banners; +1 Favor opportunities at stops; Heat +1 on any 1.
\end{itemize}

Assign Roles (\S3) to PCs/followers.

\subsection{Running the Leg}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item At each scene, use district/terrain effects and caravan tags to set Position/DV.
\item Progress: On relevant hits (Survey, Navigate, Drive, Scout, Broker, etc.), tick Distance by effect.
\item Complications: 1s → GM spends SB with Caravan SB options (\S5.4) or advances Danger/Weather.
\item When Distance fills, the leg ends at a safe stop: run Upkeep \& Market (\S4).
\end{itemize}

\section{Roles in the Caravan}

Assign any number; one person can hold two if fiction allows.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Caravan Master: final calls; Petition/Broker at posts/stops; can sacrifice 1 Favor to cancel one Social SB once/leg.
\item Quartermaster: Supplies, repairs; rolls Wits+Tactics/Craft to prevent Condition ticks.
\item Factor: contracts and customs; Audit/Broker; converts 1 Clue to Favor once/leg with proof.
\item Scout/Vanguard: ride ahead; Survey/Track; can mark Ambush Signs (tag) once.
\item Rearguard Captain: watches tail; Shield/Command during pursuit.
\item Envoy/Interpreter: rites and tongues; Host Rite, Sway; cancels one tag flip in parley once/leg.
\item Beast-Master: animal welfare; can clear one Supplies loss once/leg after a rest scene.
\item Lore-Keeper: maps, omens; Research/Expose myths and ward lines; grants DV --1 vs Ward-storm once/leg.
\end{itemize}

\section{Upkeep, Market \& Stops}

At leg's end (waystation, oasis, city gate, monastic house):

\subsection{Upkeep}

Pay one: coin • Favor • rite/appearance. If skipped → Supplies --1 and start Creditors [4] or Inspection [4].

\subsection{Repairs \& Rest}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Spend coin/Favor or a scene to reduce Condition --1.
\item A positive public moment (feast, song) clears Morale +1.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Market (no heavy math)}

Pick one cargo tag you carried (Common • Desired • Contraband • Sacred) and one market appetite tag at this stop (Hungry • Saturated • Pious • Lawful • Lax • Wary). Roll a single Broker/Petition action:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item On strong hit: gain coin + Favor (narrow) or Standing with a local office.
\item On hit: choose coin or Favor.
\item On partial: you gain coin but tick Heat +1 or a rival gains a String.
\item On miss: coin lost or cargo seized; start Litigation [4] or Rival Claim [4].
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Projects}

If you worked a Project [4--8] this leg (e.g., ``Open a new oasis'', ``Bribe a toll chain''), mark it. On fill, add the new String or tag to the caravan.

\section{Road Procedures \& DV Ladders}

\subsection{Typical Actions on the Way}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Navigate (Wits+Survey): set course, find ford. DV 2--4 (terrain/weather).
\item Drive/Handle Teams (Body+Tactics/Craft): keep pace or brake wagons. DV 2 steppe • 3 dunes • 4 pass road • 5 storm.
\item Parley at Post (Presence+Sway/Diplomacy): get water, shelter, writs. DV 2--4; --1 with Strings.
\item Outride/Screen (Body+Ride): intercept scouts; DV 3--5.
\item Ambush/Break Ambush (Wits+Tactics): DV 3--5; +1 Position with Ambush Signs tag.
\item Broker (Wits+Diplomacy/Streetwise): sell cargo or buy feed. DV 2--5; --1 with Coin-Weigh Seal.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Complications on 1s: dust cloud, dropped axle-pin, panicked team, toll chain snaps.

\subsection{Weather \& Terrain Pressures}

When Weather advances or fiction says:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Sand/Dust Storm: Position --1 for sight-based actions; Supplies --1 unless shelter tag present.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Social SB on the Road (GM Menu)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]

\end{itemize}

Clock Size by Highest Rank: 2--5 → [4], 6--10 → [6], J/Q/K → [8], A → [10].

\section{Peoples of the Way (playset hooks)}

Use these as cultural levers and Strings; tune to table canon. The analogues below are inspirations---not prescriptions.

Inspirations (GM shorthand): Fhara = Arab traders • Kuvani = Steppe peoples • Tulkani = Roma • Dhaharan = India • Sihai = China • Ashaani = Egypt (imperial ambition) • Pereshi = inland Persians • Sidhi = Levant/North Africa.

Portrayal guardrails (recommended):
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Show internal diversity (class, creed, region) in each culture; avoid single-note caricatures.
\item Emphasize craft, contracts, rites, and strings over mystification or criminal tropes.
\item When using divination/omens, frame them as social rituals or legal custom, not exotic power.
\item Let conflicts be about interests and institutions, not ``peoples are like this.''
\end{itemize}
