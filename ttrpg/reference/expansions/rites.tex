\textbf{Materials:} A deliberate, harmless lie told to a mirror.
\textbf{Effect:} Your words become ambiguously persuasive. When you Sway or Command, you may choose to have a successful roll generate \emph{Diamonds} (leverage) instead of the usual SB, as your words create useful misunderstandings or plausible deniability.
