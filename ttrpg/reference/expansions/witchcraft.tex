\section{Preamble}
There are places where the world forgets its laws.
Doorways that no one admits to knocking upon.
Names that rewrite the one who dares to speak them.
Shadows are not evil---they are consequences given shape. They are the costs we refuse to tally, the truths we bury, the debts that return to collect themselves.

\begin{RuleBox}
\Term{Witchcraft} is reciprocal and intimate. A working binds the witch to something that can answer back: a threshold, a spirit, a vow, a Name, a patron, a memory, a debt.
\end{RuleBox}

\section{Core Principles}
\subsection{Shadows}
Shadows arise wherever truth is denied, debt is unacknowledged, or identity is fractured by unmet need. They are narrative pressure given teet\documentclass[11pt,letterpaper]{article}

\subsection{Thresholds}
A threshold is any place where a state changes: waking to dreaming, innocence to agency, belonging to exile, life to echo. Crossing invites witness---and witnesses demand accounting.

\subsection{Name-Truth}
A \Term{Name} is not a label. It is a claim with weight. Names can be protected, traded, buried, sharpened, dulled, or stolen. When a working touches a Name, it touches the self behind it.

\section{Witchcraft Procedure}
\subsection{Casting a Working}
When you attempt a working, state the \Term{Intent}, the \Term{Vector}, and the \Term{Price}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \Term{Intent}: what changes (veil, bind, unmake, reveal, curse, sever, restore).
  \item \Term{Vector}: what carries the change (name, oath, threshold, shadow, dream, debt, token, bloodless offering).
  \item \Term{Price}: what you pay (Shadow, Shame, Identity).
\end{itemize}

Then roll \Term{Attribute + Witchcraft} vs \DV{} set by scope.

\subsection{Scope and Difficulty}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{0.92\linewidth}{@{}lXc@{}}
\toprule
\Term{Scope} & \Term{Examples} & \DV \\
\midrule
Subtle / Personal & blur attention, soften a memory-edge, silence a doorway, hide a token & 2 \\
Situational & bind a promise, distort a reflection, mark a Name, hinder pursuit & 3 \\
Scene-Shaping & compel a confession, veil a crowd, turn a gathering into a threshold & 4 \\
Identity-Altering & rewrite a role, bury a name-right, sever a bond, harvest an echo & 5+ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Outcomes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Term{Full Success}: The working takes hold as intended. Pay the chosen price.
  \item \Term{Partial Success}: The working takes hold with a complication. Pay the price and the GM adds a consequence.
  \item \Term{Miss}: The working fails or twists. Pay the price and the GM escalates the consequence.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Push It}
Before the roll or after a partial success, you may \Term{Push It} to increase scope or intensity.
Choose one:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mark \Term{+1 Shadow} and gain \Term{+1d}.
  \item Mark \Term{+1 Shame} and gain \Term{+1 Effect}.
  \item Mark \Term{+1 Identity Strain} and reduce the \DV{} by 1 (minimum 2).
\end{itemize}

\section{Prices}
Every working demands a price. Choose \Term{one} unless a rite specifies otherwise.

\subsection{Shadow}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You accrue spiritual residue and narrative pressure.
  \item The GM may introduce shadow-tells: cold glass, wrong reflections, trailing whispers, predatory coincidences.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Shame}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You accept an internal consequence: a Condition, a vow-compulsion, a visible hesitation, a ritual aversion.
  \item The GM may invoke Shame when your past choice becomes socially or spiritually relevant.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Identity}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You relinquish a piece of self: a cherished memory dulled, a role surrendered, a name-right compromised, a bond weakened.
  \item Identity prices always change what the character can say with full certainty about who they are.
\end{itemize}

\section{Identity Strain}
Identity Strain tracks cumulative erosion from rites that touch the self directly.

\begin{RuleBox}
\Term{Identity Strain} is a 4-step track. Mark it when a working severs, rewrites, harvests, or binds a Name; when you Push It with Identity; or when a rite demands it.
\end{RuleBox}

\begin{itemize}
  \item At \Term{4}, you must resolve strain at the end of the scene: roll \Term{Spirit + Resolve} vs \DV{} 4.
  \item \Term{Success}: Clear 1 Identity Strain.
  \item \Term{Failure}: The GM chooses or offers a hard bargain: a memory blurs, a bond becomes conditional, a Name becomes \emph{buried}, or an echo-self becomes active.
\end{itemize}

\section{Observances}
Observances are the lived rules witches follow to keep magic from turning inward and hollowing them out.

\subsection{Common Observances}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Term{Count your debts aloud} once per week at a threshold you respect.
  \item \Term{Do not cross the same threshold twice in one night} unless invited.
  \item \Term{Never speak a Name in anger} if you intend to keep it.
  \item \Term{Leave an offering} when a working succeeds cleanly: a coin, a braid of grass, a thread, a pinch of ash.
  \item \Term{Do not take from the dead without a witness}. The witness may be a spirit, a person, or the threshold itself.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Order Observances}
\subsubsection{The Shed Vigil (Lethai-ar of Isoka)}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Signs}\\
Rings of shed bone or horn; cuts on wrists marked with ash; small piles of discarded tokens at crossroads; masks split vertically, bound by cord.
\medskip

\Term{Etiquette}\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Do not refuse a witch's request for a symbolic offering.
  \item Do not speak someone's \Term{buried name} aloud.
  \item Accept the loss you cannot hide---loss defines you.
  \item Never interrupt a Severance Rite.
\end{itemize}
\end{RiteBox}

\subsubsection{Covenant Observances (Lunera)}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Bargains and Prices}\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Term{Memory Tithe}: Offer a cherished memory---not erased, but dulled for you and sharpened for another.
  \item \Term{Hidden Truth}: Reveal a secret that would transform someone's understanding of their past.
  \item \Term{Kept Silence}: Maintain a night of absolute silence at a chosen threshold; break it and the next omen arrives twisted.
  \item \Term{Selective Sight}: In exchange for perfect clarity in one specific matter, accept permanent blind spots elsewhere (agree on 1--2 narrative blind spots).
\end{itemize}
\end{RiteBox}

\section{Universal Workings}
These are patterns of craft shared across Orders; the difference is in doctrine, taboos, and cost.

\subsection{Veil Working}
Hide, blur, silence, soften, misdirect.
\begin{itemize}
  \item On success, gain \Term{+1d} on the next stealth, deception, or evasion roll in the scene.
  \item On partial, the veil works but leaves a tell: a reflection moves late, a shadow points wrong, a witness feels watched.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Binding Working}
Hold, anchor, compel, constrain, mark.
\begin{itemize}
  \item On success, impose a constraint that must be narrated and testable (``cannot speak the lie,'' ``cannot cross the doorway,'' ``must answer the question,'' etc.).
  \item On partial, the constraint holds but spawns a counter-pressure (a clock, a spirit notice, a rival claim).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unmaking Working}
Break oaths, dissolve lesser magic, strip labels, undo a threshold knot.
\begin{itemize}
  \item On success, remove one active magical effect, one binding tag, or one scene-level occult constraint.
  \item On miss, something else unravels instead (GM choice): an unrelated oath frays, a Name loosens, a memory bleeds into the present.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Crisis Working}
Forbidden intensity. The working changes the entire scene.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mark \Term{+2 Identity Strain}.
  \item On success, the scene changes as declared.
  \item On partial, it changes---and a second consequence arrives with it.
  \item On miss, the working becomes a hungry thing: it demands resolution through a clock, a bargain, or a witness.
\end{itemize}

\section{Selected Rites}
Rites are learned patterns with fixed doctrine. Each rite lists its tag, scope, and requirements.

\subsection{Rite of the Ashen Knife \hfill \textnormal{[SEVER] Low, 4 XP}}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Type}: Action \quad
\Term{Materials}: Ash; a token willingly surrendered \\
\Term{Effect}: Create a knife of ash and intent for the scene.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gain \Term{+1 Position} when breaking bindings.
  \item On a success, you may symbolically ``cut'' a minor hindrance or complication.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Shadow or Identity. \\
\Term{Push It}: Mark \Term{+1 Identity Strain} to cut a more meaningful constraint (GM sets boundary).
\end{RiteBox}

\subsection{Rite of Echoed Dreams \hfill \textnormal{[ECHO] Standard, 7 XP}}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Type}: Action; Close \quad
\Term{Materials}: Shared token from a past moment (locket, scrap of letter, shard of glass) \\
\Term{Effect}: Draw out a vivid waking-dream from a willing subject. Ask up to two:
\begin{itemize}
  \item ``Who do you most fear becoming?''
  \item ``What moment do you wish you could change?''
  \item ``What truth do you not dare to look at?''
\end{itemize}
The dream answers in symbols; the GM ties each symbol to a concrete NPC, place, or clock. You gain \Term{+1d} when acting with compassion or leverage on that truth this session. \\
\Term{Push It}: You may enter the dream with them; both gain \Term{+1d} to resist fear or confusion linked to that memory this session, and you mark \Term{+1 Obligation} to the relevant patron or witness.
\end{RiteBox}

\subsection{Hex of the Clinging Shadow \hfill \textnormal{[HEX] Standard, 8 XP}}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Type}: Scene; Near \quad
\Term{Materials}: Fragment of the target's reflection (hair from their comb, a sketch of their face, etc.) \\
\Term{Effect}: Call a second shadow to cling to the target for the scene (or until dispelled).
\begin{itemize}
  \item They cannot fully hide their intentions; social deception rolls suffer \Term{-1d}.
  \item When they attempt betrayal or flee, their shadow lags or points the wrong way (GM adds a tell or complication).
\end{itemize}
\Term{Push It}: Bind the shadow to a \Term{Shadow's Debt [4]} clock. When it fills (through lies, harm, cowardice), the shadow manifests as an echo-spirit that can testify or act once on your whispered command.
\end{RiteBox}

\subsection{Curse of the Unanswered Reflection \hfill \textnormal{[CURSE] High, 10 XP}}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Type}: Long; Far \quad
\Term{Materials}: A mirror cracked in three pieces, each named for a truth the target refuses \\
\Term{Effect}: Mark a \Term{Refusal [6]} clock on the target (individual or faction). Each time they double down on denial, cruelty, or willful ignorance, advance the clock.
\begin{itemize}
  \item At 3/6: distorted reflections whisper failings (GM adds fear, doubt, paranoia as Conditions).
  \item At 6/6: a Reckoning Scene is forced: confrontation, trial, or nightmare where the hidden truth is dragged into the open.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Identity (mandatory). Mark \Term{+1 Identity Strain}.
\end{RiteBox}

\section{Suppression and Witness}
Witchcraft hates clarity. When a working is cast under scrutiny, doctrine, lanternlight, or formal correction, increase \DV{} by 1. On a miss (or on a complication), the GM may generate \SB{} toward reprisal, exposure, or a hunter response.

\section{Quick Reference}
\begin{RuleBox}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Declare \Term{Intent}, \Term{Vector}, \Term{Price}.
  \item Roll \Term{Attribute + Witchcraft} vs scope \DV{} (2--5+).
  \item Pay \Term{one Price}: Shadow, Shame, or Identity.
  \item Optional: \Term{Push It} for +1d / +1 Effect / \DV{} -1 (at a cost).
  \item Track \Term{Identity Strain [4]} for self-touching magic.
\end{itemize}
\end{RuleBox}

\section{Witch Orders and Their Rites}

Witchcraft is not unified. Each Order encodes doctrine, taboo, and price into its rites, shaping how power is expressed and what it consumes in return. To join an Order is to accept its view of what must be sacrificed for magic to work.

\subsection{The Night Court of Mab}
The Night Court teaches that beauty is leverage, promises are weapons, and truth is negotiable under moonlight. Mab’s witches defend ambiguity and punish certainty.

\subsubsection*{Doctrine}
Reality bends most easily where desire and fear overlap. An oath half-kept is more powerful than one fulfilled.

\subsubsection*{Observances}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Never speak an unvarnished truth beneath the open moon.
  \item All bargains must contain a flaw, spoken or hidden.
  \item Broken promises are never wasted.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Signature Rites}

\paragraph{Thorn of Oaths-Broken \hfill \textnormal{[HEX] Standard}}
Impose a spiritual wound on a target who has broken a vow.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The target suffers \emph{Oath-Bleed}: Position is reduced by 1 when acting against their word.
  \item On a miss, the witch inherits the recoil of the broken oath.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Shame or Shadow.

\paragraph{Moon-Veil Compact \hfill \textnormal{[VEIL] Low}}
Wrap a subject in fae ambiguity.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gain +1d to deception or concealment for the scene.
  \item Leaves a glamour-tell visible only in reflections.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Shadow.

\subsection{The Ash Hags of Morag}
Morag’s witches embody rot, endings, and consequence. They do not forgive; they conclude.

\subsubsection*{Doctrine}
Everything ends. Magic exists to make sure it ends \emph{properly}.

\subsubsection*{Observances}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Never reverse a punishment once begun.
  \item Bones are records; treat them with respect.
  \item Mercy is a lie told by those who fear endings.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Signature Rites}

\paragraph{Bone-Truth Casting \hfill \textnormal{[REVEAL] Standard}}
Read consequence in bone or ash.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ask one question about an unavoidable outcome.
  \item The answer cannot be softened.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Shame.

\paragraph{Curse of Settled Ash \hfill \textnormal{[CURSE] High}}
Mark a target for inevitable decline.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a \emph{Decay [6]} clock that advances when the target resists accountability.
  \item At completion, a final reckoning scene occurs.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Identity (mandatory).

\subsection{The Handmaidens of Livaea}
Livaea’s witches rule through attraction, influence, and emotional architecture. Power flows through wanting.

\subsubsection*{Doctrine}
No one is free of desire. Control what is desired, and you control the world.

\subsubsection*{Observances}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Never refuse a sincere confession.
  \item Desire must always be mirrored, never denied.
  \item Public humiliation is forbidden; private leverage is sacred.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Signature Rites}

\paragraph{Thread of Longing \hfill \textnormal{[BIND] Standard}}
Bind two subjects through unfulfilled desire.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Each gains leverage over the other until the desire is resolved or destroyed.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Shame.

\paragraph{Velvet Mirror \hfill \textnormal{[REVEAL] Low}}
Reveal what a subject wishes they did not want.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gain +1 Position when acting on this knowledge this session.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Shadow.

\subsection{The Rainmaidens of Raéyn}
Raéyn’s witches are tempestuous elementalists whose emotions shape storm and tide.

\subsubsection*{Doctrine}
Emotion is not weakness. It is weather.

\subsubsection*{Observances}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Never deny your mood.
  \item Water must be returned to water.
  \item Storms demand witnesses.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Signature Rites}

\paragraph{Tidebreaker Surge \hfill \textnormal{[STORM] Standard}}
Redirect momentum in a conflict.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Allies gain +1 Position; enemies suffer -1d for one exchange.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Shadow.

\paragraph{Mist-Crowned Omen \hfill \textnormal{[REVEAL] Low}}
Read fate in condensation and rainfall.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ask one question about imminent danger or opportunity.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Shame.

\subsection{The Thorns of Malachai}
The Thorns are not servants of a patron. They are adherents to a principle: identity is harvestable. What is discarded can be claimed, reshaped, and weaponized.

\subsubsection*{Doctrine}
What the world refuses to hold must be taken. Forgotten selves are resources.

\subsubsection*{Observances}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Never destroy an identity fragment while it still remembers pain.
  \item Names are extracted, not spoken.
  \item Witnesses are liabilities.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Signature Rites}

\paragraph{Shadow Extraction \hfill \textnormal{[SEVER] Standard}}
Strip a fragment of identity from a target.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mark \emph{Identity Strain} on the target.
  \item Remove or distort a memory, bond, or role for the scene or longer.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Identity (mandatory).

\paragraph{False Echo Weaving \hfill \textnormal{[ECHO] High}}
Create a shadow-double seeded with stolen memory.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The echo may testify, mislead, or act once before unraveling.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Identity and Shadow.

\paragraph{Harvest of the Unclaimed \hfill \textnormal{[RITUAL] High}}
Ritualize mass forgetting.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Advance a shared \emph{Identity Collapse} clock in the area.
  \item At completion, the Thorns gain a permanent asset or manifestation.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Identity Strain for all participants.

\section{On Familiars}
A familiar is not a pet, a tool, or a summoned thing.
A familiar is a \emph{shared consequence}.

It is formed when a witch externalizes part of their shadow, memory, instinct, or unspoken need into a living conduit that can act, witness, and answer back. Once bound, neither witch nor familiar remains whole in the way they were before.

\begin{RuleBox}
A \Term{Familiar} is a persistent bond that allows a witch to relocate risk, perception, and cost. It amplifies magic by distributing consequence—but never removes it.
\end{RuleBox}

\section{Creating a Familiar}
To create a familiar, a witch performs a binding at a meaningful threshold and commits to an ongoing obligation.

\subsection{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A willing or capturable vessel (animal, spirit, echo, object-entity)
  \item A threshold significant to the witch
  \item A personal offering that cannot be reclaimed
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Binding}
State:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Term{What the Familiar Knows} (instinct, secret, fear, hunger)
  \item \Term{What the Familiar Wants} (safety, sensation, purpose, attention)
  \item \Term{What the Witch Gave Up} (memory, role, bond, certainty)
\end{itemize}

Roll \Term{Spirit + Witchcraft} vs \DV{} 4.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \Term{Success}: The bond forms cleanly.
  \item \Term{Partial}: The bond forms with a flaw (GM defines a behavioral complication).
  \item \Term{Miss}: The bond forms—but the familiar defines the terms of attention, need, or return.
\end{itemize}

Mark \Term{+1 Identity Strain}. This mark cannot be avoided.

\section{Familiar Nature}
Choose or define the familiar’s nature. This shapes how it interacts with magic and consequence.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{0.95\linewidth}{@{}lX@{}}
\toprule
\Term{Nature} & \Term{Expression} \\
\midrule
Animal & Heightened senses, instinctual reactions, physical presence \\
Spirit & Insubstantial movement, omen-bearing, threshold traversal \\
Echo & Memory replay, voice mimicry, emotional residue \\
Construct & Inscription, containment, durability, symbolic action \\
Parasite & Hunger-driven aid, escalation under stress \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\section{Bond Track}
Each familiar has a \Term{Bond Track [4]} shared with its witch.

Mark Bond when:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The familiar assists in a working
  \item The familiar witnesses violence, betrayal, or confession
  \item The witch Pushes a working through the familiar
\end{itemize}

When the Bond Track fills, choose one:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The familiar demands fulfillment (food, secrecy, rest, release)
  \item The familiar acts independently in line with its nature
  \item The bond destabilizes; the GM introduces a rupture or misalignment
\end{itemize}

Clear Bond only by honoring the familiar’s needs.

\section{Using a Familiar}
A familiar may be invoked once per scene without a roll for minor assistance consistent with its nature.

For greater effect, choose one option and roll \Term{Attribute + Witchcraft}:

\subsection{Extend Perception}
See, hear, smell, or sense through the familiar.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gain \Term{+1d} on awareness or tracking
  \item Cost: Mark Bond
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relay a Working}
Cast a working as if you were present where the familiar is.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Increase \DV{} by 1
  \item Cost: Familiar shares all backlash
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Absorb Consequence}
Redirect fallout from a working.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Convert 1 Shadow or Shame into 1 Bond
  \item On a miss, the familiar manifests the consequence physically or socially
\end{itemize}

\section{Familiars and Cost}
Familiars do not erase price—they \emph{translate} it.

\subsection{Shadow Through the Familiar}
Shadow may appear as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Unnatural behavior
  \item Aggression or withdrawal
  \item Physical mutation or spectral distortion
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Shame Through the Familiar}
Shame may cause:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Avoidance of certain people or places
  \item Vocalizations or gestures at inopportune times
  \item Involuntary displays of guilt or fear
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Identity Through the Familiar}
Identity loss may:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bind the familiar more tightly than intended
  \item Transfer a trait, memory, or name-fragment
  \item Cause the familiar to speak truths the witch cannot
\end{itemize}

\section{Harm to Familiars}
Familiars cannot be safely replaced.

When a familiar is harmed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The witch immediately marks \Term{+1 Identity Strain}
  \item The witch rolls \Term{Spirit + Resolve} vs \DV{} 3
\end{itemize}

On failure, gain a lingering Condition tied to the harm.

If a familiar is destroyed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The witch permanently loses something bound during creation
  \item All Bond clears
  \item The witch gains a recurring omen, scar, or echo
\end{itemize}

\section{Observances of Familiar-Binding}
\subsection{Common Observances}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Never force a familiar to cross a threshold you would refuse yourself.
  \item Do not lie to your familiar; silence is acceptable, deception is not.
  \item Feed the familiar before feeding yourself after a working.
  \item Do not bind more than one familiar without release or death between.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Signs of a Failing Bond}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The familiar avoids eye contact or reflection
  \item Shared dreams fracture or repeat
  \item The familiar reacts before the witch notices danger
  \item Names spoken near the familiar echo incorrectly
\end{itemize}

\section{Selected Familiar Rites}

\subsection{Rite of the Watching Shadow \hfill \textnormal{[BIND] Low, 4 XP}}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Effect}: Bind a minor shadow or animal as a familiar of vigilance.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Once per session, the familiar may warn of imminent danger without a roll.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Cost}: Shadow.
\end{RiteBox}

\subsection{Rite of Shared Breath \hfill \textnormal{[LINK] Standard, 7 XP}}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Effect}: Share physical strain between witch and familiar for the scene.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Split Fatigue or Harm as chosen.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Cost}: Shame or Identity.
\end{RiteBox}

\subsection{Rite of the Last Witness \hfill \textnormal{[SEVER] High, 10 XP}}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Effect}: If the witch would fall or lose consciousness, the familiar may act once to preserve a truth, message, or memory.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Afterward, the bond immediately destabilizes.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Cost}: Identity (mandatory).
\end{RiteBox}

\section{Quick Reference}
\begin{RuleBox}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Familiars relocate consequence; they do not remove it.
  \item Creating a familiar always marks \Term{Identity Strain}.
  \item Track \Term{Bond [4]} for escalating tension.
  \item Harm to a familiar harms the witch.
  \item A destroyed familiar leaves a permanent absence.
\end{itemize}
\end{RuleBox}

\section{Witchcraft Followers}

In the world of Witchcraft, followers are not merely assistants—they are the living conduits of power, the silent witnesses to hidden truths, and the keepers of sacred obligations. A Witchcraft follower exists at the threshold between the mundane and the magical, bound by pacts, oaths, and the ever-present weight of consequence.

\subsection{The Nature of Witchcraft Followers}

Witchcraft followers are those who have willingly or unwillingly bound themselves to the forces of the Witchcraft system. Unlike ordinary allies, these followers exist in the liminal space where the world's hidden currents flow most strongly. They are not merely helpers but extensions of the witch's pact, bearing the weight of Obligation, the touch of Shadow, and the ever-present threat of the Unanswered Reflection.

\subsection{Follower Types in Witchcraft}

\subsubsection{The Oathsworn}
Born from the moment a follower swears a sacred promise to a Patron, the Oathsworn are the most common form of Witchcraft follower.

\textbf{Characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Carries a visible mark of their oath (a sigil, scar, or token)
    \item Can sense when the oath is in peril
    \item May speak the true name of the Patron when called upon
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Magical Condition States:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{True-Bound}: Oath is strong; +1 die to actions related to the Patron's domain
    \item \textbf{Fractured}: Oath is strained; -1 die to Patron-related actions; +1 Obligation segment
    \item \textbf{Shattered}: Oath is broken; follower becomes a Wraith, seeking to make the witch pay
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Threshold-Keepers}
These followers walk the edge between worlds, maintaining the boundaries that keep the witch's power contained.

\textbf{Characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can sense and reinforce magical boundaries
    \item May temporarily lower a Ward for the witch
    \item Drawn to crossroads, doorways, and places of transition
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Magical Condition States:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ward-Safe}: Threshold connection strong; +1 die to boundary-related actions
    \item \textbf{Frayed}: Threshold connection weakening; -1 die to boundary actions; +1 Exposure on threshold use
    \item \textbf{Breached}: Threshold connection broken; may attract unwanted attention from beyond
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Shadow-Speaking}
Bound to the very essence of Shadow, these followers can perceive the unspoken truths that haunt the witch's path.

\textbf{Characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sees the shadows that follow the witch
    \item Can speak the words that should remain unspoken
    \item Haunted by the things they've witnessed
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Magical Condition States:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clear-Sighted}: Shadow-sight is strong; +1 die to insight/truth-detection
    \item \textbf{Clouded}: Shadow-sight is weakening; -1 die to insight/truth-detection; +1 Exposure on truth-seeing
    \item \textbf{Shrouded}: Shadow-sight is lost; may see false shadows or be consumed by darkness
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Universal Witchcraft Follower Mechanics}

\subsubsection{Obligation Tracking}
Witchcraft followers have their own Obligation clock that is tied to the witch's pact.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Obligation Clock}: 6 segments (tied to the witch's Obligation Capacity)
    \item \textbf{Filling the Clock}: When the follower's clock fills:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 3 segments: The follower gains +1 die to actions related to the pact
        \item 6 segments: A demand from the Patron is made of the witch through the follower
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clearing Obligation}: The witch must perform a service for the Patron to reduce the follower's Obligation clock
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Shadow Exposure}
Witchcraft followers accumulate Shadow Exposure from their proximity to the witch's power.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exposure Effects:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1: Can see the witch's Shadow as a faint aura
        \item 2: Hears the whispers of the Unanswered Reflection
        \item 3: Overexposed - Suffers Fatigue 1, -1 die to all rolls, and may trigger a minor Shadow event
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Shadow Harm}
Magical followers track Shadow Harm, which represents damage to their connection with the shadow world.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Harm Effects:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1: Shadow world begins to bleed into their reality
        \item 2: Suffers -1 die to social rolls with those who cannot see the Shadow
        \item 3: Dissonant - Cannot use their magical abilities; may attract Shadow entities
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Magical Assistance}
Witchcraft followers can assist in witchcraft-related actions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Standard Assistance (1 Boon cost):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Grant +1 die to witchcraft rolls within their specialty
        \item Share their insight about the ritual or Patrons
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ritual Assistance (2 Boon cost):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let the witch borrow their connection for one roll
        \item Stabilize a ritual that is about to go awry
        \item Reveal a hidden truth about the ritual's requirements
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to Gain a Witchcraft Follower}

Witchcraft followers are not easily acquired. They require:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A significant story moment that creates the pact or bond
    \item A clear oath or commitment between the witch and the follower
    \item A narrative reason for the follower to have their connection to the Witchcraft system
\end{itemize}

Gaining a Witchcraft follower costs 4 XP, but comes with an immediate 2 Obligation segments that the witch must bear.

\subsection{The Cost of Connection}

Witchcraft followers are not mere tools—they carry the weight of the witch's choices. When a follower falls, it's not just a loss of an ally—it's a fracture in the pact itself.

\begin{itemize}
    \item When a follower dies while in service, the witch gains 3 Obligation segments
    \item The witch's next ritual has a -1 die penalty (the weight of loss)
    \item The follower's spirit may return as a Shadow entity, seeking resolution
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example: The Oathsworn Follower}

\textbf{Name:} Anya the Steadfast \\
\textbf{Patron:} The Gallow's Bell \\
\textbf{Oath Mark:} A small bell-shaped scar on her left palm \\
\textbf{Starting Condition:} True-Bound \\

\textbf{Oathsworn Condition State Table:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{True-Bound}: +1 die to actions related to the Gallow's Bell's domain (truth, justice)
    \item \textbf{Fractured}: -1 die to Patron-related actions; +1 Obligation segment
    \item \textbf{Shattered}: Follower becomes a Wraith, seeking to make the witch answer for their broken oath
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Oathsworn Special Actions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Oath-Call:} Once per scene, Anya can call on the Gallow's Bell to verify a statement; the speaker must speak truth or suffer 1 Harm
    \item \textbf{Ward-Safe:} Once per ritual, she can stabilize the ritual space, reducing the risk of Backlash by one level
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Oathsworn Shadow Exposure Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1: Sees the faint glow of truth in the air
    \item 2: Hears the echoes of unspoken promises
    \item 3: Overexposed - Suffers Fatigue 1, -1 die to all rolls, and may see the shadows of broken oaths
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Witchcraft Follower Creation}

To create a Witchcraft follower:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Choose a follower type (Oathsworn, Threshold-Keeper, or Shadow-Speaking)
    \item Determine their connection to the witch (how the pact was formed)
    \item Give them a distinctive mark or trait related to their connection
    \item Set their starting condition state (usually True-Bound or Clear-Sighted)
    \item Determine one special action they can perform related to their connection
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Price of Power}

Witchcraft followers are not meant to be permanent. They are the living embodiment of the witch's choices, and like all things in the world of Witchcraft, they carry the weight of consequence. When a follower breaks, it is not just a loss—it is a story. When they thrive, they become the living proof that even in a world of shadows, there can be light.

In the end, the most powerful witchcraft is not in the spells cast or the pacts made, but in the bonds forged and the promises kept. For it is in these bonds that the true power of the Witchcraft system reveals itself—not as domination, but as the sacred responsibility of connection in a world that would rather forget.

\section*{The Unanswered Reflection}

When a follower dies while in service to a witch, the Unanswered Reflection intensifies. The witch must:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mark 3 Obligation segments immediately
    \item Suffer -1 die to all rolls until they perform an act of penance for the fallen follower
    \item Face the Shadow of the follower, who will appear at inopportune moments to remind them of their failure
\end{itemize}

The Shadow of the follower is not an enemy, but a manifestation of the Unanswered Reflection—the weight of a bond broken too soon. They do not attack, but they \textit{are} the reminder that every choice has consequences, and every bond carries a price.

\section*{The Living Pact}

Witchcraft followers are the living embodiment of the pact between witch and Patron. They are not tools to be used, but companions to be honored. When a witch respects this bond, the power of the pact grows stronger. When they take it for granted, the shadows deepen.

In the end, the true measure of a witch is not in the spells they cast, but in the bonds they keep. For in the world of Witchcraft, every promise is a thread, and the world itself is woven from the threads of unbroken oaths.
