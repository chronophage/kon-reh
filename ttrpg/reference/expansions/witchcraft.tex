\section{Preamble}
There are places where the world forgets its laws.
Doorways that no one admits to knocking upon.
Names that rewrite the one who dares to speak them.
Shadows are not evil---they are consequences given shape. They are the costs we refuse to tally, the truths we bury, the debts that return to collect themselves.

\begin{RuleBox}
\Term{Witchcraft} is reciprocal and intimate. A working binds the witch to something that can answer back: a threshold, a spirit, a vow, a Name, a patron, a memory, a debt.
\end{RuleBox}

\section{Core Principles}
\subsection{Shadows}
Shadows arise wherever truth is denied, debt is unacknowledged, or identity is fractured by unmet need. They are narrative pressure given teet\documentclass[11pt,letterpaper]{article}

\subsection{Thresholds}
A threshold is any place where a state changes: waking to dreaming, innocence to agency, belonging to exile, life to echo. Crossing invites witness---and witnesses demand accounting.

\subsection{Name-Truth}
A \Term{Name} is not a label. It is a claim with weight. Names can be protected, traded, buried, sharpened, dulled, or stolen. When a working touches a Name, it touches the self behind it.

\section{Witchcraft Procedure}
\subsection{Casting a Working}
When you attempt a working, state the \Term{Intent}, the \Term{Vector}, and the \Term{Price}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \Term{Intent}: what changes (veil, bind, unmake, reveal, curse, sever, restore).
  \item \Term{Vector}: what carries the change (name, oath, threshold, shadow, dream, debt, token, bloodless offering).
  \item \Term{Price}: what you pay (Shadow, Shame, Identity).
\end{itemize}

Then roll \Term{Attribute + Witchcraft} vs \DV{} set by scope.

\subsection{Scope and Difficulty}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{0.92\linewidth}{@{}lXc@{}}
\toprule
\Term{Scope} & \Term{Examples} & \DV \\
\midrule
Subtle / Personal & blur attention, soften a memory-edge, silence a doorway, hide a token & 2 \\
Situational & bind a promise, distort a reflection, mark a Name, hinder pursuit & 3 \\
Scene-Shaping & compel a confession, veil a crowd, turn a gathering into a threshold & 4 \\
Identity-Altering & rewrite a role, bury a name-right, sever a bond, harvest an echo & 5+ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Outcomes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Term{Full Success}: The working takes hold as intended. Pay the chosen price.
  \item \Term{Partial Success}: The working takes hold with a complication. Pay the price and the GM adds a consequence.
  \item \Term{Miss}: The working fails or twists. Pay the price and the GM escalates the consequence.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Push It}
Before the roll or after a partial success, you may \Term{Push It} to increase scope or intensity.
Choose one:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mark \Term{+1 Shadow} and gain \Term{+1d}.
  \item Mark \Term{+1 Shame} and gain \Term{+1 Effect}.
  \item Mark \Term{+1 Identity Strain} and reduce the \DV{} by 1 (minimum 2).
\end{itemize}

\section{Prices}
Every working demands a price. Choose \Term{one} unless a rite specifies otherwise.

\subsection{Shadow}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You accrue spiritual residue and narrative pressure.
  \item The GM may introduce shadow-tells: cold glass, wrong reflections, trailing whispers, predatory coincidences.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Shame}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You accept an internal consequence: a Condition, a vow-compulsion, a visible hesitation, a ritual aversion.
  \item The GM may invoke Shame when your past choice becomes socially or spiritually relevant.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Identity}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You relinquish a piece of self: a cherished memory dulled, a role surrendered, a name-right compromised, a bond weakened.
  \item Identity prices always change what the character can say with full certainty about who they are.
\end{itemize}

\section{Identity Strain}
Identity Strain tracks cumulative erosion from rites that touch the self directly.

\begin{RuleBox}
\Term{Identity Strain} is a 4-step track. Mark it when a working severs, rewrites, harvests, or binds a Name; when you Push It with Identity; or when a rite demands it.
\end{RuleBox}

\begin{itemize}
  \item At \Term{4}, you must resolve strain at the end of the scene: roll \Term{Spirit + Resolve} vs \DV{} 4.
  \item \Term{Success}: Clear 1 Identity Strain.
  \item \Term{Failure}: The GM chooses or offers a hard bargain: a memory blurs, a bond becomes conditional, a Name becomes \emph{buried}, or an echo-self becomes active.
\end{itemize}

\section{Observances}
Observances are the lived rules witches follow to keep magic from turning inward and hollowing them out.

\subsection{Common Observances}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Term{Count your debts aloud} once per week at a threshold you respect.
  \item \Term{Do not cross the same threshold twice in one night} unless invited.
  \item \Term{Never speak a Name in anger} if you intend to keep it.
  \item \Term{Leave an offering} when a working succeeds cleanly: a coin, a braid of grass, a thread, a pinch of ash.
  \item \Term{Do not take from the dead without a witness}. The witness may be a spirit, a person, or the threshold itself.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Order Observances}
\subsubsection{The Shed Vigil (Lethai-ar of Isoka)}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Signs}\\
Rings of shed bone or horn; cuts on wrists marked with ash; small piles of discarded tokens at crossroads; masks split vertically, bound by cord.
\medskip

\Term{Etiquette}\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Do not refuse a witch's request for a symbolic offering.
  \item Do not speak someone's \Term{buried name} aloud.
  \item Accept the loss you cannot hide---loss defines you.
  \item Never interrupt a Severance Rite.
\end{itemize}
\end{RiteBox}

\subsubsection{Covenant Observances (Lunera)}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Bargains and Prices}\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Term{Memory Tithe}: Offer a cherished memory---not erased, but dulled for you and sharpened for another.
  \item \Term{Hidden Truth}: Reveal a secret that would transform someone's understanding of their past.
  \item \Term{Kept Silence}: Maintain a night of absolute silence at a chosen threshold; break it and the next omen arrives twisted.
  \item \Term{Selective Sight}: In exchange for perfect clarity in one specific matter, accept permanent blind spots elsewhere (agree on 1--2 narrative blind spots).
\end{itemize}
\end{RiteBox}

\section{Universal Workings}
These are patterns of craft shared across Orders; the difference is in doctrine, taboos, and cost.

\subsection{Veil Working}
Hide, blur, silence, soften, misdirect.
\begin{itemize}
  \item On success, gain \Term{+1d} on the next stealth, deception, or evasion roll in the scene.
  \item On partial, the veil works but leaves a tell: a reflection moves late, a shadow points wrong, a witness feels watched.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Binding Working}
Hold, anchor, compel, constrain, mark.
\begin{itemize}
  \item On success, impose a constraint that must be narrated and testable (``cannot speak the lie,'' ``cannot cross the doorway,'' ``must answer the question,'' etc.).
  \item On partial, the constraint holds but spawns a counter-pressure (a clock, a spirit notice, a rival claim).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unmaking Working}
Break oaths, dissolve lesser magic, strip labels, undo a threshold knot.
\begin{itemize}
  \item On success, remove one active magical effect, one binding tag, or one scene-level occult constraint.
  \item On miss, something else unravels instead (GM choice): an unrelated oath frays, a Name loosens, a memory bleeds into the present.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Crisis Working}
Forbidden intensity. The working changes the entire scene.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mark \Term{+2 Identity Strain}.
  \item On success, the scene changes as declared.
  \item On partial, it changes---and a second consequence arrives with it.
  \item On miss, the working becomes a hungry thing: it demands resolution through a clock, a bargain, or a witness.
\end{itemize}

\section{Selected Rites}
Rites are learned patterns with fixed doctrine. Each rite lists its tag, scope, and requirements.

\subsection{Rite of the Ashen Knife \hfill \textnormal{[SEVER] Low, 4 XP}}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Type}: Action \quad
\Term{Materials}: Ash; a token willingly surrendered \\
\Term{Effect}: Create a knife of ash and intent for the scene.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gain \Term{+1 Position} when breaking bindings.
  \item On a success, you may symbolically ``cut'' a minor hindrance or complication.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Shadow or Identity. \\
\Term{Push It}: Mark \Term{+1 Identity Strain} to cut a more meaningful constraint (GM sets boundary).
\end{RiteBox}

\subsection{Rite of Echoed Dreams \hfill \textnormal{[ECHO] Standard, 7 XP}}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Type}: Action; Close \quad
\Term{Materials}: Shared token from a past moment (locket, scrap of letter, shard of glass) \\
\Term{Effect}: Draw out a vivid waking-dream from a willing subject. Ask up to two:
\begin{itemize}
  \item ``Who do you most fear becoming?''
  \item ``What moment do you wish you could change?''
  \item ``What truth do you not dare to look at?''
\end{itemize}
The dream answers in symbols; the GM ties each symbol to a concrete NPC, place, or clock. You gain \Term{+1d} when acting with compassion or leverage on that truth this session. \\
\Term{Push It}: You may enter the dream with them; both gain \Term{+1d} to resist fear or confusion linked to that memory this session, and you mark \Term{+1 Obligation} to the relevant patron or witness.
\end{RiteBox}

\subsection{Hex of the Clinging Shadow \hfill \textnormal{[HEX] Standard, 8 XP}}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Type}: Scene; Near \quad
\Term{Materials}: Fragment of the target's reflection (hair from their comb, a sketch of their face, etc.) \\
\Term{Effect}: Call a second shadow to cling to the target for the scene (or until dispelled).
\begin{itemize}
  \item They cannot fully hide their intentions; social deception rolls suffer \Term{-1d}.
  \item When they attempt betrayal or flee, their shadow lags or points the wrong way (GM adds a tell or complication).
\end{itemize}
\Term{Push It}: Bind the shadow to a \Term{Shadow's Debt [4]} clock. When it fills (through lies, harm, cowardice), the shadow manifests as an echo-spirit that can testify or act once on your whispered command.
\end{RiteBox}

\subsection{Curse of the Unanswered Reflection \hfill \textnormal{[CURSE] High, 10 XP}}
\begin{RiteBox}
\Term{Type}: Long; Far \quad
\Term{Materials}: A mirror cracked in three pieces, each named for a truth the target refuses \\
\Term{Effect}: Mark a \Term{Refusal [6]} clock on the target (individual or faction). Each time they double down on denial, cruelty, or willful ignorance, advance the clock.
\begin{itemize}
  \item At 3/6: distorted reflections whisper failings (GM adds fear, doubt, paranoia as Conditions).
  \item At 6/6: a Reckoning Scene is forced: confrontation, trial, or nightmare where the hidden truth is dragged into the open.
\end{itemize}
\Term{Price}: Identity (mandatory). Mark \Term{+1 Identity Strain}.
\end{RiteBox}

\section{Suppression and Witness}
Witchcraft hates clarity. When a working is cast under scrutiny, doctrine, lanternlight, or formal correction, increase \DV{} by 1. On a miss (or on a complication), the GM may generate \SB{} toward reprisal, exposure, or a hunter response.

\section{Quick Reference}
\begin{RuleBox}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Declare \Term{Intent}, \Term{Vector}, \Term{Price}.
  \item Roll \Term{Attribute + Witchcraft} vs scope \DV{} (2--5+).
  \item Pay \Term{one Price}: Shadow, Shame, or Identity.
  \item Optional: \Term{Push It} for +1d / +1 Effect / \DV{} -1 (at a cost).
  \item Track \Term{Identity Strain [4]} for self-touching magic.
\end{itemize}
\end{RuleBox}
