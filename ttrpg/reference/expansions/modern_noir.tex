\begin{noirsection}[Campaign Overview]{noirblack}
\subsection*{\faMap\ Campaign Hook}

\textbf{The Premise:} You are a private investigator, detective, or troubled professional working the mean streets of a modern city where neon lights cast long shadows and everyone has something to hide. The cases are personal, the stakes are high, and the truth is rarely simple.

\textbf{Real Hook:} In a city where corruption runs deep and justice is often just another commodity, you've chosen to walk the line between order and chaos. But every case you take pulls you deeper into a web of lies, and every truth you uncover makes you a target.

\textbf{Thematic Elements:} Moral Ambiguity, Urban Decay, Personal Stakes, Information As Currency, Noir Atmosphere

\textbf{Key Noir Elements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Moral Ambiguity:} Right and wrong are not clearly defined
    \item \textbf{Urban Isolation:} Characters are alone in a crowded city
    \item \textbf{Information Control:} Knowledge is power, and everyone guards theirs carefully
    \item \textbf{Personal Consequences:} Choices have lasting impact on character and story
    \item \textbf{Atmospheric Tension:} Mood and setting drive the narrative as much as plot
\end{itemize}
\end{noirsection}

\subsection*{\faFolder\ Core Investigation Mechanics}

\begin{casebox}[One-Shot Case Framework]{noirblack}
\textbf{Designed for 2-3 hour sessions:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spade:} Crime/Inciting Incident (the hook that pulls you in)
    \item \textbf{Heart:} Key Person (central figure in the case)
    \item \textbf{Club:} Complication/Pressure (what makes it difficult)
    \item \textbf{Diamond:} Reward/Resolution (what you can gain or achieve)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rank Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2-5:} Simple case with straightforward resolution
    \item \textbf{6-10:} Moderate complexity with meaningful choices
    \item \textbf{J/Q/K:} Complex case with multiple viable solutions

\textbf{B Evidence:} Good - circumstantial but compelling, single reliable witness\\
\textbf{C Evidence:} Fair - circumstantial, questionable witness reliability\\
\textbf{D Evidence:} Weak - hearsay, speculation, compromised source\\
\textbf{F Evidence:} Unreliable - contradicted, obtained illegally, severely compromised
