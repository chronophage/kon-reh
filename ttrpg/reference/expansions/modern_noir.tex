\section{Modern Noir Expansion Overview}

\subsection{Core Concept}

Noir in Fate's Edge should create moral ambiguity and personal consequences while maintaining player agency through meaningful investigation and social choices. The city is both setting and character.

\subsection{Key Innovations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Vice Clock system for character flaws
\item 52-card case generator for quick setup
\item Investigation point economy for resource management
\item Evidence rating system for clue tracking
\item District-based environmental modifiers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Target Themes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Moral ambiguity and ethical compromises
\item Urban isolation and personal stakes
\item Information as currency and power
\item Atmospheric tension and city as character
\item Personal consequences and character growth
\item Social dynamics and class conflict
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mechanical Focus}

\begin{itemize}
\item Investigation procedures with resource costs
\item Social manipulation and information gathering
\item Character corruption through Vice system
\item Environmental hazards and urban modifiers
\item Evidence management and case building
\end{itemize}

\section{Core Mechanical Framework}

\subsection{Vice Clock - Character Flaw Management}

The signature system represents the noir protagonist's fatal flaw through a mechanical system that creates tension between character growth and self-destruction.

\begin{mechanic}{Purpose and Integration}
This system connects to the existing Boon economy while adding personal consequences that drive narrative forward. Players choose when to spend Boons to prevent Vice advancement, creating meaningful decisions about self-control versus indulgence.
\end{mechanic}

\textbf{Sample Uses:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Emotional Vice temptation during key interview (+1 segment) - player spends 1 Boon to resist
\item Physical Vice crisis state affects investigation rolls (-2 dice) - player must spend 2 Boons to clear 1 segment
\item Professional Vice creates complications with authorities - party must collectively decide how to manage compromised colleague
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Resource Management - Investigation Points and Evidence}

\textbf{Acquisition Methods:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Case setup (2 base points per case)
\item Successful investigation rolls (1 point per success)
\item Diamond card rewards from case resolution
\item XP conversion (2 Boons = 1 XP, max 2 per session)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Spending Options:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Automatic success on investigation actions (1 point per use)
\item Evidence preservation and enhancement
\item Information brokerage with contacts
\item Emergency rerolls in critical situations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Narrative Weight:} Players must choose between immediate investigative advantages and long-term case building.

\subsection{Risk/Reward Balance}

\textbf{Safe Choices:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Surface-level investigation with minimal personal exposure
\item Conservative approach with reduced Investigation Point economy (-1 die penalties)
\item Avoiding direct confrontation with dangerous elements
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Risky Choices:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Deep investigation with significant personal cost
\item Direct engagement with criminal elements
\item Pursuing sensitive information at personal risk
\item +1-2 Vice segments, evidence contamination risks
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Failure States:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Case collapse due to evidence loss or witness intimidation
\item Personal reputation damage affecting future cases
\item Legal consequences requiring character retirement
\item Character transformation into antagonist
\end{itemize}

\section{Campaign Clock Framework}

\subsection{Primary Clock: Case Clock (4-10 segments)}

Progress toward case resolution and complications affecting investigation timeline.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tableheader}
\textbf{Case Clock} & \textbf{Progress toward case resolution and complications} \\
\hline
Segments & \textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet 0/4 (for 2-5 cards) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Advancement Triggers:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Time pressure elements (2-5 cards): +1 segment per day/scene
\item Complication cards (6-10): +1 segment
\item Major complications (J/Q/K): +2 segments
\item Twists/Aces: +3 segments or immediate crisis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Consequences when filled:} Case reaches critical point - resolution required, evidence destroyed, witness lost, or personal crisis.

\subsection{Secondary Clocks}

\subsubsection{Vice Clock (4 segments per vice)}

Character personal flaw progression affecting performance and judgment.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tableheader}
\textbf{Vice Clock} & \textbf{Character personal flaw progression} \\
\hline
Segments & \textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet 0/4 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Triggers:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Temptation situations: +1 segment per scene (automatic)
\item Resisted advancement with 1 Boon
\item Cleared with 2 Boons (1 segment reduction)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Consequences:} Increasing penalties to rolls, SB generation, crisis states requiring immediate attention.

\subsubsection{Pressure Clock (6-8 segments)}

External forces complicating investigation through authority/criminal interference.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tableheader}
\textbf{Pressure Clock} & \textbf{External forces complicating investigation} \\
\hline
Segments & \textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet 0/6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Triggers:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Authority interference: +1 segment
\item Media attention: +1 segment
\item Criminal retaliation: +2 segments
\item Personal threats: +2 segments
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Consequences:} Reduced investigation options, increased danger, forced resolution paths.

\subsubsection{Reputation Clock (8 segments)}

Professional/social standing effects on future opportunities and contact cooperation.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|m{4cm}|m{8cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{tableheader}
\textbf{Reputation Clock} & \textbf{Professional/social standing effects} \\
\hline
Segments & \textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet\textbullet 0/8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Triggers:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ethical compromises: +1 segment
\item Successful cases: +1 segment
\item Public exposure: +2 segments
\item Scandals: +3 segments
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Consequences:} Future case difficulty, contact availability, authority cooperation levels.

\subsection{Clock Interaction}

Case Clock drives other clocks; as it advances, Pressure and Reputation clocks accelerate. High Vice segments make Case advancement faster due to compromised judgment.

This Modern Noir expansion provides GMs with flexible tools for running urban investigation campaigns while maintaining the mechanical elegance and player agency that defines Fate's Edge. Whether running a single-session case or an extended noir campaign, these tools ensure that moral ambiguity and personal consequences remain central to the experience.

Remember that the best noir emerges from player investment in their characters' flaws and the urban environment around them. Use these mechanical tools to support narrative tension and character development, not replace them. The moral complexity of noir choices should feel meaningful and lasting.

\begin{center}
\textbf{In the shadows of the city, where neon lights cast long shadows and everyone has something to hide, the truth waits patiently. Will you find it? What will it cost you? Will you survive the consequences?}
