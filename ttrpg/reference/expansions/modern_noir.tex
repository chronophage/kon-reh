\begin{noirsection}[Campaign Overview]{noirblack}
\subsection*{\faMap\ Campaign Hook}

\textbf{The Premise:} You are a private investigator, detective, or troubled professional working the mean streets of a modern city where neon lights cast long shadows and everyone has something to hide. The cases are personal, the stakes are high, and the truth is rarely simple.

\textbf{Real Hook:} In a city where corruption runs deep and justice is often just another commodity, you've chosen to walk the line between order and chaos. But every case you take pulls you deeper into a web of lies, and every truth you uncover makes you a target.

\textbf{Thematic Elements:} Moral Ambiguity, Urban Decay, Personal Stakes, Information As Currency, Noir Atmosphere

\textbf{Key Noir Elements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Moral Ambiguity:} Right and wrong are not clearly defined
    \item \textbf{Urban Isolation:} Characters are alone in a crowded city
    \item \textbf{Information Control:} Knowledge is power, and everyone guards theirs carefully
    \item \textbf{Personal Consequences:} Choices have lasting impact on character and story
    \item \textbf{Atmospheric Tension:} Mood and setting drive the narrative as much as plot
\end{itemize}
\end{noirsection}

\section{Quick Case System}

\subsection*{\faFolder\ Core Investigation Mechanics}

\textbf{One-Shot Case Framework (Designed for 2-3 hour sessions):}

\textbf{Case Elements (Draw 3 cards from standard deck):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spade:} Crime/Inciting Incident (the hook that pulls you in)
    \item \textbf{Heart:} Key Person (central figure in the case)
    \item \textbf{Club:} Complication/Pressure (what makes it difficult)
    \item \textbf{Diamond:} Reward/Resolution (what you can gain or achieve)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rank Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2-5:} Simple case with straightforward resolution
    \item \textbf{6-10:} Moderate complexity with meaningful choices

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Quick Setup:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw 3 cards (Spade, Heart, Club)

    \item Start with 2 Investigation Points
\end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{A Evidence:} Strong - solid documentation, reliable witness, clear chain of custody
    \item \textbf{B Evidence:} Good - circumstantial but compelling, single reliable witness
    \item \textbf{C Evidence:} Fair - circumstantial, questionable witness reliability
    \item \textbf{D Evidence:} Weak - hearsay, speculation, compromised source
    \item \textbf{F Evidence:} Unreliable - contradicted, obtained illegally, severely compromised
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Jack:} "Bent Rules" - Cutting corners attracts official scrutiny
    \item \textbf{Queen:} "Dirty Deals" - Taking bribes or compromising ethics
    \item \textbf{King:} "Corrupt Core" - Systematic abuse of professional position
    \item \textbf{Ace:} "Badge of Corruption" - Authority weaponized for personal gain
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Diamonds (Psychological Vice) - Red:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Jack:} "Paranoid Tendencies" - Seeing threats, alienating allies
    \item \textbf{Queen:} "Trust Issues" - Inability to work effectively with others
    \item \textbf{King:} "Complete Isolation" - No personal connections, vulnerable

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Vice Clock States:}

\textbf{1 Segment - Temptation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generate 1 additional CP when rolling for actions related to this vice
    \item Minor roleplay reminders (character references the temptation)
\end{itemize}

    \item -2 dice penalty to rolls when resisting or when deprived
    \item Must spend 1 Boon per session just to function normally
    \item Start scenes with 2 banked CP related to this vice
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4 Segments - Crisis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generate 4 additional CP when rolling for vice-related actions
    \item -3 dice penalty to ALL rolls when deprived
    \item Cannot spend Boons for other benefits until crisis resolved
    \item Start scenes with 3 banked CP related to this vice
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Vice Clock Management:}

\textbf{Prevention (Ongoing):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cost:} 1 Boon per scene
    \item \textbf{Effect:} Prevent Vice Clock from incrementing
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mitigation (Active):}

\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Character Creation Integration:}

\textbf{Starting Vice Clock Values:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Jack Draw:} 1 segment
    \item \textbf{Queen Draw:} 2 segments
    \item \textbf{King Draw:} 3 segments  
    \item \textbf{Ace Draw:} 4 segments (immediate crisis scene)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Multiple Vice Management:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only one Vice Clock increments per scene (character's choice)
    \item Other vices generate 1 CP each per scene regardless
    \item Managing multiple vices requires proportionally more resources
\end{itemize}
