# Rites Users and Invokers: A Quick Reference

## Core Concepts

**Rites** are structured bargains with alien patrons, not traditional spells. They run on **Boons** and a **Patron Obligation Clock** that measures attention and debt.

### Key Mechanics

- **Invoke**: Spend required Boon(s) and mark +1 segment on the Rite's Obligation Clock
- **Push It**: Use the Rite's alternative clause (+1 segment)
- **Backlash**: When a roll aided by the Rite results in Miss or Success & Cost (+1 segment)
- **Cap**: Maximum +3 segments per scene per Rite

## Character Options

### Talent: Thiasos Bond (Familiar) - 6 XP
- Bind a supernatural familiar keyed to your Patron
- Can Assist actions involving that Patron's Rites
- If a Rite marks 2+ segments in a scene, the Thiasos is endangered

### Asset: Codex of the Binding Art - 4/8 XP
- **Minor** (4 XP): Covers 1-2 Rites
- **Standard** (8 XP): Covers 3-4 related Rites
- Uses Asset Condition track: Maintained/Neglected/Compromised
- During Downtime, can Study to restore to Maintained and clear 1 segment

### Rite Costs (Learning)
- **Low-Power**: 4-5 XP

## Access Ladder

## Single Patron Bond
Characters can only be bound to one patron at a time. To switch patrons, must undergo the **Rite of Severance**.

## Obligation Clock Management
- **During play**: Spend 1 Boon to clear 1 segment
- **During Downtime**: Maintained Codex clears 1 segment from one associated Rite
- **Tending Thiasos**: Can clear 1 segment from one Rite
- **Attention**: When a Rite's Obligation Clock fills, the Patron's attention manifests as a narrative complication
