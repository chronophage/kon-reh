Political Intrigue Campaign Framework (Fate’s Edge)

Version 0.2 — playtest iteration

⸻

Design Goals
	•	Why: Enable long-form campaigns about courts, city-states, guilds, and ecclesiastical power where choices echo across seasons.
	•	Mechanical Need: Provide clear procedures for social conflict and faction play using existing Fate’s Edge engines (Position, DV, SB, clocks).
	•	Narrative Richness: Turn every roll into a living thread—alliances, scandals, mandates, and crises that persist between sessions.
	•	Player Appeal: Deliver tasty levers for scheming—favor, leverage, reputations, and followers—without burying the table in bookkeeping.

Principle: This framework adds procedures, not new math. Use the core rules for rolls; this module tells you what to prep, track, and tick.

⸻

Quickstart (2 minutes)
	1.	Pick a Seat of Power (city, court, guildhall, synod).
	2.	Create 3–5 Faction Sheets (template below). Give each faction an Influence clock [6], an Exposure clock [6], and a Stability clock [6–8].
	3.	Lay a Campaign Mandate and Campaign Crisis dial (0–6 each). They ebb and flow across the season.
	4.	For each session, declare a Situation Clock (4–8) that resolves the immediate political question.
	5.	Play scenes. Every 1 rolled gives the GM SB to push Social SB options (faux pas, rival leverage, concessions, etc.).
	6.	Between sessions, run the Intrigue Cycle (below) to advance clocks off-screen and seed the next scandal.

1) Faction Play: Components & Templates

1.1 Faction Sheet (Template)

[FACTION NAME]
Tier: (street / guild / city / crown / synod)
Aim: (what they want this season)
Stance toward PCs: (Allied / Wary / Hostile)
Levers (3): (money, law, clergy, blades, secrets, ships, votes, rites…)
Leader & Lieutenants: (names + one sentence intent)
Reputation Tags (2): (Merciful, Ruthless, Old-Blood, Reformers, Ascetic…)
Clocks:
- Influence [6]: how aligned they are with PC aims; fills to grant access/patronage
- Stability [6–8]: how coherent the faction remains; fills → schism/coup/purge
- Exposure [6]: public risk & scandal; fills → scandal event triggers
Holdings/Assets: (2–5 named assets with a sentence of function)
Strings: (1–3 hooks tying them to locales, laws, rites, or other factions)

When to tick (with examples):
	•	Influence: Tick when PCs advance or protect the faction’s stated Aim or humiliate an active rival of that Aim. (e.g., securing a river charter the Harbor Guild wants = +1; discrediting the Tide-Chart Office that opposes them = +1.) Routine gifts or favors without movement on the Aim do not tick.
	•	Stability: Tick when internal strains surface beyond normal bickering: leadership succession wobbles, cadre splits over doctrine, budget shortfalls force cuts, a key lieutenant defects, or magical overreach taxes rites/logistics. (e.g., failed purge → +1; whispered heresy inside the Ember-Temple → +1.)
	•	Exposure: Tick on visible missteps: public concessions or humiliations, failed high-profile actions (especially when the GM spends Social SB), leaks of leverage, or collateral harm to bystanders. (e.g., bribery discovered → +2; foiled blackmail exposed → +1.)

1.1.1 Strings — What They Do
A String is a concrete tie: “Controls river tolls,” “Holds three Synod votes,” “Custodian of the Lantern Rites,” “Patron of the Playhouse.”
	•	Acting with/through a String relevant to your action: improve Position one step or gain a small edge (treat DV as –1) once per scene.
	•	Acting against a String that belongs to the target: worsen Position one step or the GM banks +1 SB.
	•	Cutting or Seizing a String should be a clock (4–6). On fill, move the String to the victor’s sheet or strike it.

1.2 Relationship Map (Strings & Stakes)

Sketch the web. For every arrow between two factions, write a stake (e.g., “river tolls,” “chapterhouse votes,” “forbidden codex”). Pick two arrows to mark volatile; these will pop first when SB hits.

Volatility Triggers:
	•	When either faction’s Exposure fills, immediately trigger the volatile stake as an on-screen complication or new Situation Clock.
	•	When Crisis rises by 1 in the campaign, the GM may trigger one volatile arrow anywhere on the map.
	•	A targeted Social SB spend may flip a volatile stake early (GM choice; announce loudly).

Map-to-Action Hooks:
	•	Acting along an arrow where you have positive Strings on either node: +1 Position or DV –1.
	•	Acting against a node where you have negative entanglement (Hostile stance or disgraced tag): –1 Position or GM banks +1 SB.
(These are caps; do not chain multiple arrows for stacking.)
Sketch the web. For every arrow between two factions, write a stake (e.g., “river tolls,” “chapterhouse votes,” “forbidden codex”). Pick two arrows to mark volatile; these will pop first when SB hits.

1.3 Campaign Dials
	•	Mandate (0–6): table’s public legitimacy and door-opening power.
	•	Crisis (0–6): pressure from rivals, costs, and backlash.
Set both to 2 at campaign start unless fiction says otherwise. Let play move them.

Mechanical Hooks:
	•	Mandate:
	•	0–1: Cold reception. Public venues start at Desperate unless you bring Favors/Strings.
	•	2–3: Recognized. Once per social scene, treat Position as one step higher when invoking a relevant Favor or String.
	•	4–5: Credible power. Once per session, cancel one Social SB spend targeting you in public venues. Public institutions set DV –1 versus your petitions.
	•	6: Standard-bearers. Start public scenes at Controlled unless fiction strongly opposes; your endorsements create a 4-clock Bandwagon on targets.
	•	Crisis:
	•	0–1: Calm waters. No extra effect.
	•	2–3: Tension. At the start of each session, the GM banks +1 SB for political scenes.
	•	4–5: Boiling. First failed social action each session ticks party Exposure +1.
	•	6: Breaking point. Start political scenes with a Counter-Clock [4] in play.

2) Scene Procedures for Social Conflict

2.0 Social Conflict at a Glance (Core Summary)
	1.	Intent → State the political question and stakes.
	2.	Position & DV → Set Dominant/Controlled/Desperate and DV from fiction.
	3.	Roll → Resolve using core dice. Any 1s generate SB (yes, social scenes too).
	4.	Outcome → Apply effect to the Situation Clock and tags; GM spends any SB for complications.
	5.	Ripple → Tick related Faction Clocks and adjust Mandate/Crisis as warranted.

2.1 Framing a Political Scene

State the Question: What changes if the PCs prevail (e.g., “Will the Guild sign the grain compact?”).

Put a Clock on It: Start a Situation Clock [4–8]. It resolves the scene goal (yes/no or specific shift). Optionally start a Counter-Clock [4–6] representing the opposition’s program (e.g., “Rival frames you as extortionists”).

Set Position & DV: Use the fiction to pick Dominant / Controlled / Desperate and a DV (2 routine, 3 pressured, 4 hard, 5+ extreme). State stakes before the first roll.

2.2 Intrigue Actions (examples)

Use core attributes/skills; tailor to your table’s list. Each action suggests position triggers, typical DV, and on-hit effects. All actions may create SB on 1s.
	•	Petition (Presence + Sway): Present a case to a decision-maker.
	•	Position: Dominant if you hold recognized writs/favors; Desperate if petitioning a hostile court.
	•	DV: 2–4. Hit: Fill Situation Clock by effect; on strong hit, also tick faction Influence.
	•	Bribe (Wits + Streetwise or Lore): Move resources to open doors.
	•	Position: Controlled; worsens if watched/holy ground.
	•	DV: 2–3. Hit: Set a Temporary Tag (Greased Palms) for the target institution this scene; on miss, tick Exposure.
	•	Blackmail (Wits + Investigation): Apply leverage from secrets.
	•	Position: Controlled → Desperate if leverage is unverified.
	•	DV: 3–5. Hit: Choose: force a concession now or place a 4-segment Compromise Clock on the target that you can later cash to shift Position to Dominant.
	•	Broker (Presence + Diplomacy): Reconcile two hostile parties.
	•	Position: Controlled if you host on neutral ground; Dominant with ritual hospitality; Desperate if one side brought blades.
	•	DV: 3–4. Hit: Reduce both parties’ Exposure by 1 and fill Influence for whichever you favored.
	•	Expose (Presence + Performance): Publicly reveal truth/forgery.
	•	Position: Dominant with corroboration; Desperate with hearsay.
	•	DV: 3–5. Hit: Add the Disgraced tag to the target for the arc; fill 2–3 segments on their Exposure.
	•	Shield (Wits + Tactics or Lore): Pre-empt rival plays with protocol, law, or counter-messaging.
	•	Position: Controlled; Dominant with legal counsel/rites.
	•	DV: 3. Hit: Reduce incoming SB spends against you by 1 once this scene, and mark Stability –1 for your ally faction (shoring up cohesion).
	•	Host Feast / Vigil (Presence + Performance or Rite): Gather elites; set tone.
	•	Position: Dominant if traditions observed; Desperate if taboo broken.
	•	DV: 2–4. Hit: Create 1–2 Audience Tags (e.g., “Warmed,” “Skeptical”) that modify later actions; at scene end, tick Mandate +1 if the event was a triumph.
	•	Infiltrate (Body/Wits + Stealth/Deception): Plant evidence, steal ledgers, or ghost a meeting.
	•	Position: Desperate when warded/sanctified.
	•	DV: 3–5. Hit: Gain Leverage (1) (see Favor & Leverage) or fill the Situation Clock. On partials, GM starts a Security or Rumor counter-clock.

Add magical color freely (rites, invocations, oaths). Magic should change Position, clocks, or tags—not replace the scene.

2.3 Social SB Options at Your Fingertips

During political scenes, when 1s appear the GM spends SB to:
	•	Minor faux pas; rumor spreads; ask for a concession.
	•	Rival interjects with leverage; the gallery turns; patronage flips.
	•	Currency hits: Lose 1 Favor with an implicated institution; a used Leverage becomes public, ticking either your Exposure +1 or the target’s (GM/fiction decides if unclear); or an Audience/Institution Tag shifts against you.
Tie each spend to a visible change in clocks, Position, or tags.

2.4 Resolution

A scene resolves when the Situation Clock fills or when fiction dictates. Then ripple:
	•	Advance or reduce involved Faction Clocks (Influence/Stability/Exposure).
	•	Adjust Mandate/Crisis (usually ±1 each depending on victory and visible costs).
	•	Record any Audience/Institution Tags that persist.

2.5 Situation vs. Faction Clocks — Default Ripple

Use this default unless a move states otherwise:
	•	On Situation success (favors the PCs): Tick allied faction Influence +1 (or +2 if the win obviously advances their Aim), reduce their Exposure –1 if the win was visibly clean; hostile faction Exposure +1.
	•	On Situation failure (hurts the PCs): Tick opposing faction Influence +1 (or +2 if it directly advances their Aim); allied faction Exposure +1. If the failure was internal to a faction, also tick that faction’s Stability +1.
	•	Neutral/compromise: Each side Influence +1 or both Exposure +1, GM’s choice guided by fiction.

3) The Intrigue Cycle (Between Sessions)

Use this once per session (or per in-fiction week/month when play jumps forward).

Step A — Update World State
	•	For each active faction, advance Stability or Exposure by 1 if they suffered public pressure or internal strain.
	•	For each unresolved thread, tick a related clock by 1 (or start a 4–6 clock).

Step B — Draw/Prompt for Events
	•	Method: Draw blindly from your prompt deck or deliberately pick suits that mirror the table’s themes. Use Suit for type (Hearts court/crowd; Spades violence; Clubs resources; Diamonds environment/omens) and Rank for severity (low=+1, mid=+2, face/ace=+3 segments).
	•	Apply: Place each card on a faction/clock and immediately tick by its severity, then write one sentence of fallout that must surface next session.
	•	Example: Hearts 7 → “A romance or oath becomes public,” tick Exposure +2 on whichever faction is most implicated. Clubs 10 → “Trade shock or strike,” start a 6-clock Shortages touching any merchant-facing faction.

Step C — Off-Screen Actions
	•	Each PC may direct one off-screen move using a follower/asset/network (examples in §5). Resolve with a single roll at Significant Time scale; on a hit, apply effect; on 1s, the GM banks SB and/or ticks Exposure.
	•	Each PC may direct one off-screen move using a follower/asset/network (examples in §5). Resolve with a single roll at Significant Time scale; on a hit, apply effect; on 1s, the GM banks SB and/or ticks Exposure.

Step D — Recompute Mandate & Crisis
	•	If the table’s wins were visible and valued, Mandate +1. If costs, riots, or scandals mounted, Crisis +1. Both can move in the same step.

Step E — Prep Next Situation
	•	Name the next immediate political question. Put a 4–8 clock on it. Grab 2–3 complications tied to factions and prior tags.

4) Currencies: Favor, Leverage, Exposure, & Reputation

4.1 Favor (Table Currency)

Favors track goodwill owed by a specific person or institution. Earn a Favor when you deliver visible benefit or save a leader’s face. Spend a Favor to:
	•	Improve Position by one step against that person/institution.
	•	Cancel one Social SB spend aimed at you in their venue.
	•	Access a restricted office, archive, or sanctum once.
Favors are narrow; specify the scope (e.g., “Harbormaster’s Office,” not “All of Kahfagia”). Three unspent favors from the same seat convert to Standing (Tag) with them.

4.2 Leverage (Portable)

Leverage represents a transferable pressure (compromising letter, hidden lineage, debt note). One unit of Leverage (1) can:
	•	Force a concession equivalent to one segment on a Situation Clock, or
	•	Hold Position at Controlled when it would drop to Desperate.
Decay: Only public uses count toward decay. After two public uses of the same leverage, convert it to Exposure +1 on you or the target (your choice). Private uses do not decay it, but if you privately use the same leverage three times, it becomes stale; you must refresh it (a new proof, witness, or circumstance) before it functions again.

4.3 Exposure (You & Them)

Track Exposure [6] for the party (or per face character if you prefer) and on each major faction. When a track fills, trigger a Scandal Event: public censure, hostile audit, inquisitorial summons, riot, dueling demand, etc. Clear 2 on a successful Shield scene or by accepting a humiliating concession on-screen.

4.4 Reputation Tiers

Characters naturally climb from local to world-shaping influence. Use reputation to gate rooms, raise stakes, and attract bigger clocks. (Mechanically unchanged; this module only calls when to check it.)

Checking Tier (guideline): At the end of an arc (or every 2–3 sessions), if two of the following are true, advance your Reputation Tier:
	•	You converted 3 favors from one institution into Standing (Tag) or hold Standing with two different institutions.
	•	Mandate ≥ 4 at arc end or you resolved a city-scale Situation Clock [8] in your favor.
	•	Your deeds created or resolved a regional law/rite or seated/removed a leader.

Gatekeeping Effects:
	•	Higher tiers grant access to higher-tier factions and venues by default; DVs for petitions to lower-tier offices drop by 1.
	•	Clocks scale with tier: at higher tiers, prefer 6–8 segment Situation Clocks; low-tier play uses 4–6.
	•	When your tier outstrips a scene’s stakes, the GM may simply hand you the room unless an opposing String or Leverage is present.

5) Followers & Assets in Politics

Followers, agents, scribes, barristers, and spies are the lifeblood of intrigue.

On-Scene:
	•	Assign a follower to Assist (granting dice/effect as usual) or to take an independent scene action with its own risk. Harm to followers often lands as Stability or Exposure ticks on their faction.

Off-Screen Orders (Intrigue Cycle):
	•	Each PC may direct one follower/asset on a Significant-Time operation (surveil, seed rumors, counter-bribe, audit a ledger, escort witnesses). This can occur during an ongoing adventure as a cutaway or between sessions; resolve with one roll using the follower’s capability as positioning. On a hit, apply 1–2 segments to the intended clock. On 1s, bank SB and mark Exposure +1 (your trail shows).

Upkeep & Entanglements:
	•	Track names, not ledgers. When the GM spends 2+ SB in a political arc, an ally may face the consequence instead: a compromised informant, a bribed clerk, a stolen seal. Convert major entanglements into new Situation Clocks or Faction Clock ticks rather than binary losses. Roll once using the follower’s capability as a flat bonus or as narrative positioning. On a hit, apply 1–2 segments to the intended clock. On 1s, bank SB and mark Exposure +1 (your trail shows).

Upkeep & Entanglements:
	•	Track names, not ledgers. When the GM spends 2+ SB in a political arc, an ally may face the consequence instead: a compromised informant, a bribed clerk, a stolen seal. Convert major entanglements into threads and clocks rather than binary losses.

6) Generators (Scandal Decks & Prompts)

Use your standard prompt deck (or tables) to inspire politics.

Suits as Political Color
	•	Hearts: Court favor, marriages, oaths, crowd mood.
	•	Spades: Violence, duels, arrests, street pressure.
	•	Clubs: Resources, trade shocks, supply, strikes.
	•	Diamonds: Environment, festivals, omens, disasters.

Ranks as Severity
	•	Low (2–5): Gossip, minor obstructions (tick 1 segment).
	•	Mid (6–9): Scandals, votes, riots, inquisitors (tick 2 segments).
	•	Face/Ace: Institutions shift; laws change; thrones wobble (tick 3 segments; start/finish a major clock).

Draw Procedures
	•	Quick Hook (2 cards): What’s the scandal? Who is entangled?
	•	Full Seed (4 cards): Place each onto a faction/clock and write one sentence of fallout per card.
	•	Act Builder: One card per act: Establishment → Escalation → Resolution; note which clocks must move.

Worked Examples
	•	Hearts 7: A scion’s oath of love becomes public; tick Exposure +2 on their house and start a 4-clock Secret Betrothal.
	•	Spades King: A duelist challenges the Tide-Marshall; start a 6-clock Public Blood; if it fills, Mandate –1 for the city guard.
	•	Clubs 6: Dockworkers strike; tick Stability +1 on Harbor Guild; create the tag “Pickets at Dawn.”
	•	Diamonds 9: Omens sour during a procession; tick Exposure +2 on the Ember-Temple unless rites are appeased.

⸻

7) Regional Starting Kits (Seeds)

Pick one to taste; swap names for your own setting as needed.
	•	Thepyrgos — Synod & Collegium:
	•	Factions: Archons’ Synod (law & rites), Collegium of Keys (knowledge & scriptoriums), Harbor Guild (tariffs & pilots), Ember-Temple (zeal & charity), Vagrant Companies (sellswords & scandals).
	•	Sparks: A charter revision threatens the Collegium’s privileges; the Harbor Guild bankrolls a populist reform; a Temple schism spills into the streets.
	•	Silkstrand — City of Bridges:
	•	Factions: Dye Syndicate, Archivolt, Riverine Patrol, Bridge-Lords, Playhouse Mummers.
	•	Sparks: A curse knits into the tithe ledgers; the river patrol seizes a rival’s barge; a mummer’s satire names names.
	•	Viterra — Hedge-Law Realm:
	•	Factions: Parish Courts, Crown Surveyors, Dike Brotherhoods, Village Moots, Tithe-Keepers.
	•	Sparks: A boundary survey voids ancestral rights; a moot declares a hedge-law that embarrasses a duke; floodworks need a vote now.
	•	Ecktoria — Marble & Fire:
	•	Factions: Legions Remnant, Sun-Temples, Merchant Courts, Imperial Exarchs, Civic Aqueducts Office.
	•	Sparks: A lost patent resurfaces; a relic procession turns political; the Exarch audits the Aqueducts just before summer.
	•	Kahfagia — Lantern-Law Harbors:
	•	Factions: Admiralty, Pilots, Fog-Bell Wardens, Tide-Chart Office, Salt Syndicates.
	•	Sparks: A lantern-law reform collapses smuggler bargains; a bell-line goes dark in a storm week; pilots strike.

8) Example of Play (short)

Frame: The PCs want the Harbor Guild to endorse their candidate for Tide-Marshall.

Setup: Situation Clock “Guild Endorsement” [6]. Counter-Clock “Rival Frames You as Smugglers” [4]. Current Mandate 3, Crisis 2. Faction (Harbor Guild) Influence 2/6, Exposure 1/6.

Scene 1 — Petition:
	•	Position: Controlled (you brought a respected pilot as sponsor).
	•	DV 3. The face character rolls (Presence+Sway). Result: 2 successes, one 1 → Partial. Fill 1 on Endorsement, GM spends SB for Social Complication: Concession required (a guild donation). PCs pay coin → keep Position.

Scene 2 — Expose (Counterplay):
	•	You reveal the rival’s forged manifests at a public quayside hearing.
	•	Position: Dominant (documented proof).
	•	DV 3. Strong hit → Fill 2 on Endorsement and 2 on the rival faction’s Exposure. The gallery warms; tag “Smell of Salted Justice.”

Scene 3 — Shield:
	•	You pre-empt a night raid by filing lantern-law protocols and stationing bell-wardens.
	•	Position: Controlled; DV 3. Success → Reduce incoming SB spend by 1 this scene and tick the Guild’s Stability –1 (they rally behind the rules).

Resolution: Endorsement clock fills in Scene 4 after a Broker action. Mandate +1 (public win). Rival’s Exposure hits 6/6 → scandal event: their treasurer resigns. Next session’s hook writes itself.

⸻

Guidance for Use
	•	Stay Visible: Every spend changes the map: a tag, a clock, a dial.
	•	Escalate Honestly: When Crisis climbs, show it: protests, inquisitors, budgets, bans.
	•	Reward Face-Saving: In intrigue, dignity can be worth more than coin.
	•	Keep It Human: Even in a world of rites and spirits, politics is people.

⸻

Designer Notes (for iteration)
	•	This module assumes no new dice rules. If you want sharper duels-of-wit, add an Audience Mood clock [4–6] that both sides fight over.
	•	Consider a Reputation Tag Ladder: at 3 identical favors from an institution, that institution grants a lasting tag (e.g., Trusted Pilots), which acts like standing advantage in their halls.
	•	Magic should be a multiplier for Position and tags, not a bypass for consent or law. Keep rites consequential.
