🎲 Fate’s Edge Player Meta-Strategy Cheat Sheet

1. Position Is Everything
	•	Dominant: Re-roll 1 failure → safest, most reliable.
	•	Controlled: Baseline.
	•	Desperate: Re-roll 1 success → risk + SB fuel, only worth it for big payoffs.
	•	Spend 1 Boon → Step Up Position for your current action. Best use of Boons in a pinch.

2. Boon Economy
	•	Gain: Partial = +1, Miss = +2.
	•	Spend:
	•	Assist (+1 die) — 1 Boon (stack up to +3 dice).
	•	Improve Position (+1 step) — 1 Boon.
	•	Clear Leash tick (summoners) — 1 Boon.
	•	Cap: Max 5 Boons; convert extras to XP (2→1 XP, once per session).

⸻

3. Fatigue & Harm
	•	Fatigue Track = Body.
	•	When it fills → +1 Harm, Fatigue clears.
	•	Harm 1: −1 die (specific).
	•	Harm 2: −1 die (most).
	•	Harm 3: Incapacitated.
	•	Recover: Short rest = −2 Fatigue, full rest = all. Harm needs treatment.

💡 Plan around Fatigue thresholds—sometimes it’s better to let it tip into Harm between fights than collapse mid-scene.

⸻

4. Magic & Casters
	•	Runekeeper: One-action rites—fast, safe.
	•	Cantor: Songs/Pushes are powerful but spike Fatigue + Corruption. Save Push for dramatic beats.
	•	Invoker: Rituals are slow—use “Crack the Seal” for emergencies at high cost.
	•	Channel + Weave: Expect 2 steps; allies should protect casters mid-cast.

⸻

5. Party Synergy
	•	Frontliner (Body 4): Interpose, draw fire, anchor clocks.
	•	Support (Inspire/Boons): Keep the engine running; Assist key rolls.
	•	Runekeeper: Lock down environments, prevent spirals.
	•	Scout: Mobility = Position control (flank, elevation, setup actions).
	•	Cantor: High drama = plan around corruption pops, don’t waste them on filler.

⸻

6. Meta-Table Tactics
	•	Failure farming: A safe Miss = 2 Boons → fuel for later heroics.
	•	Clocks: Watch GM clocks (Mob Overwhelm, Fatigue Spiral). Target what feeds them.
	•	SB Awareness: 1s and Pushes give GM ammo. Sometimes restraint > risk.
	•	Crits: Don’t just cheer—crit flourishes = free Boon or improved effect. Cash them in.

⸻

Quick Priorities
	1.	Boost Position (Dominant wins games).
	2.	Bank & Spend Boons — don’t hoard over 5.
	3.	Manage Fatigue — pace effort, rest often.
	4.	Protect Casters during Channel/Weave.
	5.	Hit GM clocks before they spiral.

⸻

👉 Fate’s Edge rewards calculated risk + teamwork more than raw luck. Think in terms of Position, Currency, and Clocks.
