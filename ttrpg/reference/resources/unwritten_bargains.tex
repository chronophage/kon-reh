\chapter*{A Whisper in the Static}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{A Whisper in the Static}

The world you know is a lie, a thin scrim over the rotting canvas of what truly \textit{is}. The gods are silent, if they ever spoke at all. In their absence, other things listen. They press against the membrane of reality from the Outside, from the spaces between stars, from the deep, forgotten places of the world. They are not gods. They are hungers. Concepts given alien sentience. They are the \textbf{Patrons}.

To invoke a \textbf{Rite} is not to cast a spell. It is to strike a bargain. It is to offer a piece of your will—a \textbf{Boon}—and in return, a sliver of their impossible power flows through you. But with each invocation, you mark a segment on that Patron's \textbf{Obligation Clock}. You are ringing a bell in the silence, and something turns its head. When the clock fills, the Patron's attention manifests. It is never pleasant.

Some bind a fragment of the Patron's essence as a \textbf{Thiasos}, a familiar that serves as a conduit and a warning. Others codify these dangerous pacts in a \textbf{Codex}, a text that must be meticulously maintained to keep the bargains stable. The most cautious walk the \textbf{Invoker Path}, using sacred \textbf{Symbols} and lengthy rituals to placate the Patron's nature, trading speed for a measure of safety.

This book contains the known bargains. Speak the words, provide the offering, pay the Boon. But remember: every debt must be settled. The only question is, what will you owe when the final segment is marked?

\section*{On the Nature of Bargains}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{On the Nature of Bargains}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Invoke:} Spend the required Boon(s) and mark +1 segment on the Rite's Obligation Clock.
    \item \textbf{Push It:} Use the Rite's alternative, more potent clause. This always marks an \textbf{additional +1 segment}.
    \item \textbf{Backlash:} If a roll aided by a Rite results in a Miss or a Success with a Cost, mark +1 segment on its Clock.
    \item \textbf{Cap:} A single Rite can only mark a maximum of +3 segments per scene.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{The Patrons and Their Rites}

\section{The Witness: The Unblinking Eye}

There are no secrets, only unobserved facts. The Witness is the Patron of this absolute truth. It is the silent watcher in the shadowed corner, the perfect memory of the stone, the unerring record of events. It does not judge, it only \textit{knows}. Its followers are investigators, archivists, and spies who trade ambiguity for the cold comfort of certainty. The Witness is unique; it is never jealous of other favored patrons, for in its domain, all actions are merely data to be filed away.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Eyes in the Shadow (Low, 4 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{Obsidian focus; a drop of blood.}{Auto-succeed on one mundane Notice this scene \textit{or} ask one yes/no about immediate surroundings.}{Also gain +1 die on all investigation rolls this scene, but mark Exposure +1.}

\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Unblinking Gaze (Low, 5 XP)}{Duration: Hour; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{A drop of ink placed on the eyelid.}{Perfectly recall anything you consciously focus on within Near range for the duration. This grants +2 effect to a single Recall action or allows automatic success on memorizing a single page, map, or short sequence.}{The memory becomes eidetic and can be perfectly reproduced, but you cannot form new memories for the next hour.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{Standard-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Veil of the Unseen Observer (Standard, 7 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{None.}{+2 dice to perception/investigation/recall; ask one specific factual question the GM must answer if knowable.}{Pierce one mundane disguise/obfuscation once, but generate 1 SB (Spades) from the revelation.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Frozen Moment (Standard, 7 XP)}{Duration: Instant; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{A shard of glass or ice.}{As a reaction to taking harm from a single, small object (e.g., an arrow, a thrown knife), you freeze it in motion for one beat, causing the attack to miss. The object hangs in stasis.}{The frozen object can be gently redirected, but you suffer Fatigue 1 from the temporal strain.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{High-Power Rites}

This can reveal hidden actions, confirm alibis, or expose lies. Alternatively, you may ask the GM one question about an event that occurred in the zone within the last hour.}{The replay includes sound, but you must witness the replay yourself and cannot act during it.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\section{Ikasha, She Who Sleeps: The Umbral Potential}

Where light creates a hard edge, shadow holds infinite possibility. Ikasha is the patron of that potential. She dwells in the spaces between, in the latent power of the unacted thought, the path not taken. Her grammar is subtlety and understanding, favoring vows made without torches. She loathes the rigid law of Mykkiel, for shadow cannot be bound, and favors the fluid tides of Raéyn. Her rites are for those who move unseen, who draw strength from silence, and who understand that the greatest power often lies in waiting.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Touch the Umbral Veil (Low, 4 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Self; Stacking: Yes (stealth only).}{A piece of black cloth.}{Start \emph{Controlled} on one Stealth roll or add +1 effect to hiding/moving quietly.}{Gain brief shadow-muffling (ignore one noisy tell), but you leave behind a shadow-double that mimics your movements.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Whispering Shade (Low, 5 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Zone; Stacking: No.}{Extinguishing a candle.}{Cause shadows in the zone to subtly move and distort. This can be used to grant +1 die to a Create Diversion action or to impose a −1 die penalty on a single enemy's concentration-based action.}{The shadows form a brief, terrifying shape, but the shadows remember your face and may seek you out later.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{Standard-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Draw from the Umbral Reservoir (Standard, 8 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Self or Ally; Stacking: No.}{A vial of water from a moonless night.}{+2 dice to stealth/deception/inner-reserve \emph{or} clear \emph{Fatigue 1} from target.}{Also gain one free escape attempt, but you must pay the favor forward by helping another escape within the next scene.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Secret Keeper's Burden (Standard, 9 XP)}{Duration: Instant; Range: Touch; Stacking: No.}{A lock of the target's hair or a personal item.}{Compel a touched creature to truthfully answer one specific, direct question. They may be cryptic, but cannot lie. The GM may allow a Resolve roll to resist if the question touches on a deeply protected secret.}{You learn not only the answer, but a key emotional context, but the target learns one of your secrets in return.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{High-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Become the Shadow Itself (High, 12 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{Standing in a pool of absolute darkness.}{Intangible to mundane harm; pass through small openings; +2 dice to Stealth; auto-succeed one escape. Cannot manipulate normal objects.}{Interact with a single bound object once, but you become partially corporeal and vulnerable for one beat.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Silent Council (High, 13 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}{Whispering a question into a darkened corner.}{The shadows themselves become your informants. You may ask up to three yes/no questions about events that have occurred within the area in the last 24 hours, receiving answers from the collective memory of the darkness.}{You may ask one of the questions about an event that is currently happening out of your direct sight, but the shadows demand a favor in return to be paid within the week.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\section{The Sacred Geometry: The Unseen Architecture}

Beneath the chaos of the world lies a perfect, immutable order. The Sacred Geometry is the patron of this underlying pattern—the mathematical truth of a spiral shell, the harmonic ratio of a chord, the inevitable logic of a falling domino. Its followers are architects, engineers, and mathematicians who see the universe as a solvable equation. To invoke its rites is to impose a fragment of this absolute order upon a messy reality, but perfection is a demanding master, and even a single flaw can unravel the entire design.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Find the Pattern (Low, 5 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Self; Stacking: Yes (investigation only).}{A compass and a straightedge.}{+1 die to decode patterns/codes/systems; re-roll one 1 on math/logic rolls.}{Upgrade effect by one step on a single roll, but you become obsessed with finding patterns in unrelated phenomena for the scene.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Ordered Step (Low, 4 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{Walking in a perfect square.}{Your movements become unnaturally precise. Ignore penalties from difficult terrain for walking. +1 die to any action requiring perfect physical calibration or balance.}{You can walk a short distance across a fragile surface without causing a sound or breakage, but you must follow a geometrically perfect path.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{Standard-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Thread the Loom of Chance (Standard, 7 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{A set of weighted dice or a balanced scale.}{Re-roll \emph{all} dice on one roll \emph{or} downgrade \emph{Miss/Partial} to \emph{Success \& Cost}.}{Treat one zone tag as favorable for this action, but you must accept an equal but opposite consequence later in the scene.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Golden Ratio (Standard, 8 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Touch; Stacking: No.}{A measured length of string, divided according to the golden ratio.}{Touch one object no larger than a door. For the scene, its structure is optimized. A door becomes harder to break (+1 effect to resist), a weapon strikes truer (+1 die to its next attack), or a tool provides +1 effect on its next use.}{The optimization affects two similar, connected objects, but the effect on the second object is half strength.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{High-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Rewrite the Fundamental Equation (High, 12 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Zone; Stacking: No.}{A complex geometric diagram drawn at the zone's center.}{Declare one physics/magic rule different within a zone (no instant kills; GM veto for scene-enders). Once/scene, downgrade one \emph{Miss} to \emph{Success \& Cost}.}{Affect a second adjacent zone for one beat, but the change creates an unstable paradox that generates 2 SB.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Platonic Form (High, 13 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}{A perfectly shaped crystal or gem.}{You perceive the ideal form behind reality. Choose one: Gain +2 dice to see through illusions and disguises; or, when crafting or repairing, you achieve a flawless result, granting the object +1 effect on its first use.}{You can impose this perfect form for a moment, causing a flawed object to function perfectly once, but the object shatters afterward.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\section{Khemesh, the Kraken: The Crushing Depths}

The pressure of the abyss is not merely physical; it is a cosmic force of inevitability. Khemesh, the Kraken, is the patron of this relentless pressure—the weight of the ocean, the slow grind of tectonic plates, the inescapable pull of the grave. Its domain is not just water, but all that is heavy, inexorable, and crushing. Its followers are those who understand that sometimes the most direct solution is to apply overwhelming force, and that all things, given enough time and pressure, will eventually break.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Grasp of the Minor Depth (Low, 5 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Near; Stacking: Yes (move/drag only).}{A handful of wet sand.}{+1 effect to pull/drag/pressure \emph{or} on a hit against you, force attacker to generate 1 SB (their suit).}{Impose \emph{Off-Balance} (minor condition) on a target you move, but you become briefly waterlogged and suffer −1 die to your next action.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Briny Taste (Low, 4 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{A sip of salt water.}{You exert a subtle, constant pressure. Foes in Close range feel a palpable sense of weight, suffering −1 die on initiative or quick-draw actions. You gain +1 die to resist being moved or grappled.}{A single foe in Close range is visibly slowed, but the pressure affects you as well, causing Fatigue 1.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{Standard-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Command the Grasp of the Abyss (Standard, 8 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}{A deep-sea shell held to the ear.}{Force one foe into \emph{Desperate} position \emph{or} +2 effect to destruction.}{Spread \emph{Desperate} to a second engaged foe, but you must make a Spirit + Resolve test (DV 2) or become momentarily overwhelmed by the depths.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Inexorable Tide (Standard, 7 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Zone; Stacking: No.}{Tracing a wave pattern on the ground.}{The environment becomes sluggish and heavy. All movement within the zone costs 1 extra AP, or the first movement each character makes is treated as one position step worse (Dominant, Controlled).}{The effect is particularly strong against one named target, affecting them twice, but the tide turns against you if you remain in the zone.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{High-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Command the Abyssal Maw (High, 12 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Zone; Stacking: No.}{The sound of a great wave crashing.}{Force all opponents in scene into \emph{Desperate} if fictionally justified \emph{or} +3 effect to pure destruction.}{Collapse cover or footing in one zone, but you become partially submerged in the conceptual depths and suffer −1 die to social actions for the scene.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Kraken's Embrace (High, 14 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}{The bone of a large sea creature.}{You create a zone of crushing deep-sea pressure. All within it suffer −2 dice to physical actions and cannot take two actions in a beat. Those who start their turn in the zone must resist or gain the \emph{Stunned} condition.}{The pressure becomes tangible, allowing you to make a crushing attack against everyone in the zone, but you must concentrate fully and cannot take other actions.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\section{Raéyn of the Sea: The Eternal Flux}

Where Khemesh represents the crushing weight of the deep, Raéyn embodies its opposite: the ceaseless, fluid motion. She is the patron of tides, change, and the gentle but undeniable pull of circumstance. Her domain is not destruction but transformation—the erosion of shores, the shifting of sands, the turning of fortunes. Her followers are sailors, diplomats, and gamblers who understand that fighting the current is futile, but riding it can carry one to unexpected shores. She favors adaptability over rigid force.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Read the Gentle Current (Low, 4 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Self; Stacking: Yes (nav only).}{A floating leaf or a weather vane.}{+1 die to navigation/weather/flow \emph{or} shift 1 SB (minor) to a different suit.}{Grant an ally +1 die on the next travel check, but you become temporarily disoriented and suffer −1 die to your next navigation roll.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Shifting Sand (Low, 5 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{A handful of sand or a changing cloud.}{You adapt to changing circumstances. Once per scene, when a situation changes unexpectedly (a new foe arrives, the weather turns), you may take a moment to reassess, granting yourself +1 die on your next action related to the new situation.}{An ally in Close range also gains this benefit, but you must guide them through the adaptation, limiting your own actions.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{Standard-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Ride the Tides of Fate (Standard, 7 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{A coin flipped three times.}{Shift one declared SB spend to a different suit \emph{or} +1 die to water travel/change-navigation.}{Reduce one foe's effect by one step if they contest movement, but the tides remember and may turn against you later.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Ebbing Vigor (Standard, 8 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}{A retreating wave or a fading echo.}{You can weaken a target's resolve. A single character in Near range suffers −1 die to Resolve rolls and their emotions become more volatile (GM may shift generated SB towards Hearts or Spades).}{The target also suffers −1 die on their next action based on their current dominant emotion, but their emotional state becomes unpredictable and may affect allies as well.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{High-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Call the Storm's Judgment (High, 12 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Zone; Stacking: No.}{Shouting into the wind.}{Name a target; environment opposes them: −1 die to actions and they generate SB on success involving exertion. \emph{Or} clear all \emph{Fatigue} in Near allies.}{Extend penalty to a second, related target, but the storm's attention is drawn and may affect unintended targets.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Uncharted Course (High, 13 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{A map with a blank spot.}{You become a nexus of beneficial chance. Once per beat, you may reroll a single die for any roll you make or an ally in Close range makes. Alternatively, you may force an enemy to reroll a single die on their successful action.}{You may use this ability twice in a single beat, but you must choose which rolls to influence before seeing the results.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\section{The Clockwork Demon: The Entropy of Progress}

Some patrons are ancient forces of nature; others are born of mortal ambition. The Clockwork Demon is a creature of forbidden knowledge and inevitable decay—the patron of technology that bites the hand that builds it, of complex systems that collapse under their own weight. It thrives on the paradox of creation leading to destruction. Its followers are mad engineers, saboteurs, and those who understand that every innovation contains the seeds of its own obsolescence. To bargain with the Demon is to embrace progress with all its glorious, catastrophic failures.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Whisper to the Gears (Low, 4 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Near; Stacking: Yes (simple mech).}{A drop of oil or a loose screw.}{+1 die to simple mechanisms \emph{or} make a broken simple device work once.}{Also gain +1 effect on this fix, but the device becomes temperamental and may fail at a critical moment.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Unseen Flaw (Low, 5 XP)}{Duration: Instant; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}{Tapping a complex device three times.}{You intuitively understand a point of failure in a single mechanical or social system you can see. On your next action to exploit that flaw, you gain +2 effect.}{The flaw manifests immediately as a minor, distracting failure, but you can also exploit a second, related flaw with +1 effect.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{Standard-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Wind the Gears of the Proscribed (Standard, 9 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}{A forbidden tool or diagram.}{Temporarily repair/enhance a device for the scene \emph{or} +2 dice to Crafts/Engineering with forbidden methods.}{Add one extraordinary flourish, but the device becomes unstable and may explode or malfunction violently.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Calculated Breakdown (Standard, 8 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Zone; Stacking: No.}{Scattering a handful of rust or sand.}{Accelerate entropy in a zone. Complex devices are more likely to jam or fail (−1 die to operate), and structures creak and strain. You gain +1 effect to any action that aims to break or sabotage something in the zone.}{A single device of your choice in the zone suffers a catastrophic failure, becoming unusable, but you can scavenge useful components from the wreckage.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{High-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Wind the Engine of Forbidden Knowledge (High, 15 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Near; Stacking: No.}{A core of unstable energy.}{Dramatically repair/create a complex device for a scene \emph{or} +3 dice to forbidden engineering.}{Device exceeds specs for one action, but the unstable energy creates a hazardous field that affects all nearby.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Final Scrap (High, 14 XP)}{Duration: Instant; Range: Touch; Stacking: No.}{A hammer blow or a final command.}{You touch a complex object or structure (up to the size of a small building) and command it to fail. It suffers an immediate, catastrophic, and irreversible breakdown. This is not an explosion, but a rapid dissolution into its component, useless parts.}{The breakdown is contained and quiet, but the released energy must go somewhere and affects the surrounding area.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\section{Isoka, Angel of Serpents: The Art of Shedding}

Change is not always gentle like the tides; sometimes it is a violent, necessary shedding. Isoka is the patron of this transformative release—the casting off of old skins, identities, and loyalties. She represents the cunning required to survive when environments shift, and the freedom found in letting go of what no longer serves. Her followers are spies, survivors, and revolutionaries who understand that adaptation is the highest form of strength. To invoke her rites is to embrace metamorphosis, but every shed skin leaves evidence behind.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Loosen the Old Skin (Low, 4 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: Yes (resist only).}{A discarded snakeskin or a loose thread.}{+1 die to resist an ongoing Condition this scene \emph{or} re-roll one 1 on escape/evasion.}{Also ignore one minor movement penalty, but you leave behind a piece of your old self that others can use against you.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Subtle Shift (Low, 5 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{Shifting a small object from one pocket to another.}{Your demeanor becomes fluid. +1 die to Deceive rolls to appear as a slightly different social class or profession. Alternatively, +1 effect to blend into a new crowd or environment.}{The change is convincing enough to bypass a single, minor security check, but you must maintain the deception and cannot easily return to your original identity.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{Standard-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Shed the Skin of the Former Self (Standard, 8 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{A full change of clothes and a new mannerism.}{+2 dice to resist a named ongoing Condition; once/session declare a minor physical contingency retroactively.}{Clear a \emph{temporary} identity-based minor Condition, but your former identity becomes aware of the change and may seek you out.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Forked Tongue (Standard, 7 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{A deliberate, harmless lie told to a mirror.}{Your words become ambiguously persuasive. When you Sway or Command, you may choose to have a successful roll generate \emph{Diamonds} (leverage) instead of the usual SB, as your words create useful misunderstandings or plausible deniability.}{A specific, carefully worded lie you tell this scene is accepted as truth, but the truth you've displaced seeks to return and complicate matters.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 5 segments.}
\end{rite}

\subsection{High-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Complete Metamorphosis (High, 12 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{A complete and total change of identity, including personal effects.}{Full appearance/voice change; start \emph{Controlled} on Deceive/Stealth; once/scene declare minor contingency retroactively.}{Also spoof scent/biometric for one check, but your original identity becomes partially unmoored and may act independently.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Cast-Off History (High, 13 XP)}{Duration: Extended; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{Burning all records of your old life.}{You perform an extended ritual to shed a past identity. Upon completion, all mundane records and common knowledge of your former self become hazy and unreliable. Those seeking you via that identity suffer −2 dice to their efforts. This does not affect magical scrying or those who knew you intimately.}{The ritual creates a false but plausible "death" for your old identity, but someone who knew you well may sense the deception.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\section{Inaea, Angel of the Spider: The Weaver of Fates}

Where Isoka sheds connections, Inaea spins them. She is the patron of intricate webs—both social and circumstantial. Her domain is not raw chance, but the subtle connections between cause and effect, the debts owed, the favors called in. She sees the world as a vast tapestry, and her followers are manipulators, strategists, and those who understand that pulling the right thread can make the whole design unravel. To bargain with Inaea is to become a conscious part of the pattern, but webs entangle the weaver as surely as the fly.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Tie a Simple Knot (Low, 4 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Near; Stacking: Yes (link once).}{A single strand of thread.}{Declare two minor events linked; force 1 SB (suit chosen by GM) on a foe \emph{or} grant +1 die later to a related roll.}{Pre-load the +1 as a held advantage this scene, but the web of fate becomes more complex and may entangle unintended targets.}

\section{Mor'iraath, Demon of Fire: The Consuming Hunger}

Fire does not create; it transforms through destruction. Mor'iraath is the patron of this primal consumption—the wildfire that clears the forest, the forge-fire that tempers steel, the passionate blaze that burns away hesitation. Its domain is pure, unadulterated transformation through heat and light. Its followers are revolutionaries, blacksmiths, and those who believe that sometimes the old must be utterly destroyed to make way for the new. To bargain with Mor'iraath is to wield incredible power, but fire is indiscriminate and always hungers for more fuel.

\section{Mykkiel, Angel of Law: The Unyielding Edict}

If the world is chaos, then Mykkiel is its antithesis. He is the patron of order, process, and absolute justice—the letter of the law made manifest. His domain is the contract, the statute, the unbreakable rule. His followers are judges, bureaucrats, and enforcers who believe that civilization rests upon immutable principles. To bargain with Mykkiel is to wield authority with divine sanction, but law is a double-edged sword that binds the wielder as much as the target. He is particularly disdainful of the chaotic nature of Ikasha's shadows.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Invoke the Letter of the Law (Low, 4 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Self; Stacking: Yes (authority only).}{A scroll or a badge of office.}{+1 die when acting as authority/enforcing a known rule \emph{or} force a successful minor action against you to either accept a small narrative consequence or re-roll at −1 die.}{Name the statute; gain +1 effect on compliance, but you become bound by the same strict interpretation.}

\section{Varnek Karn, the Bone King: The Final Dominion}

All paths lead to the same throne. Varnek Karn is the patron of death's inevitability and the dominion that extends beyond the grave. His kingdom is silent, cold, and absolute. His followers are necromancers, grave-wardens, and those who understand that death is not an end but a transition to a different kind of power. To bargain with the Bone King is to claim authority over the departed, but his gifts always carry the chill of the tomb, and the dead serve with the resentment of those eternally bound.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\section{Mab, She of the Thorned Crown: Twilight Bargains}

\textit{And speak not Nine to Mab...}
Some bargains are written in blood; others are woven with moonlight and thorns. Mab is the patron of fae logic, twilight bargains, and promises that bind more tightly than chains. Her court exists in the spaces between yes and no, where every gift carries a price and every favor creates a debt. Her followers are tricksters, diplomats, and those who understand that the most powerful agreements are those where both parties believe they've won. To bargain with Mab is to dance with chaos, but her favors are never free, and her memory is eternal.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Fae Fortune's Favor (Low, 4 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Self; Stacking: Yes (luck/social).}{A four-leaf clover or a laugh.}{Re-roll one die showing 1–2 on luck/charm \emph{or} start \emph{Controlled} on one whimsical charm/deceit.}{Name a fae quirk that colors the scene, but you become temporarily bound by fae logic and cannot act directly against it.}

\section{Nidhoggr, the World-Worm: The Dreaming Antiquity}

Before cities, before kings, before even the first fires of mortals, there was the Dream. Nidhoggr is the patron of this primordial memory—the knowledge that sleeps in stone, the history written in fossil beds, the truths that predate language itself. Its followers are archaeologists, historians, and those who seek answers in the dust of ages. To bargain with the World-Worm is to gain perspective measured in millennia, but ancient knowledge carries ancient curses, and some truths are better left buried.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\section{The Outsider: The Intrusion from Elsewhere}

Some patrons belong to this world, however alien their nature. The Outsider does not. It is the patron of the spaces between spaces, the angles that shouldn't exist, the doors that open to nowhere. Its domain is intrusion, violation of natural law, and the unsettling truth that reality has cracks. Its followers are explorers of the impossible, thieves who steal from other dimensions, and those who find safety in being where they shouldn't be. To bargain with the Outsider is to become a living paradox, but every intrusion weakens the fabric of what is real.

\section{Maelstreus, the Red Prince: Infernal Deals}

Some bargains are made with hunger; others with calculation. Maelstreus is the patron of the perfectly unfair deal—the contract where the fine print damns you, the offer you can't refuse, the debt that compounds eternally. His domain is leveraged power, where every gain comes from another's loss. His followers are lawyers, merchants, and manipulators who understand that the most binding chains are those we willingly put on ourselves. To bargain with the Red Prince is to gain immediate advantage, but his scales always balance in the end, and the interest is paid in soul-currency.

The GM has final veto on game-breaking terms.}{The contract includes a hidden "fine print" that benefits you in a way the signatory did not anticipate, but the Red Prince takes a special interest in the contract and may interfere to ensure its fulfillment.}

\section{The Traveler: The Ways Between}

Paths are not merely lines on a map; they are living things that remember every footstep. The Traveler is the patron of these arterial routes—the hidden shortcuts, the forgotten trails, the roads that change when no one is looking. Its followers are messengers, scouts, and those who understand that the journey itself holds more power than the destination. To bargain with the Traveler is to move through the world as if it were made of doors, but every path taken leaves an echo, and some roads prefer not to be walked.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Set the Waystone (Low, 5 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: Yes (travel only).}{A chalk sigil or ribboned pebble placed by the Thiasos at a threshold, milestone, or crossroads.}{Start \emph{Controlled} on one Traverse/Scout movement this scene \emph{or} treat one terrain/visibility penalty as one step less severe.}{One ally in \emph{Close} also gains the same benefit on their next movement, but the waystone marks your passage and may attract unwanted attention.}
\textit{Requires: Familiar. Invoke: 1 Boon. Obligation: 4 segments.}
\end{rite}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Quickened Step (Low, 4 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Self; Stacking: No.}{A light pack and comfortable shoes.}{You move with preternatural ease.

\section{The Carrion-King: The Cycle of Decay}

Life feeds on death, and death nourishes life. The Carrion-King is the patron of this essential, unending cycle—the rot that fertilizes new growth, the breakdown that makes way for rebuilding. Its followers are farmers, healers, and those who understand that endings are merely transitions. To bargain with the Carrion-King is to work with nature's most fundamental process, but decay is indiscriminate, and those who dance with rot risk becoming part of the compost.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Rite of Gentle Rot (Low, 5 XP)}{Duration: Instant; Range: Touch; Stacking: Yes (decay only).}{A piece of spoiled food or a dead insect.}{Accelerate natural decay on one small, non-living object (e.g., rot a rope, tarnish a metal lock, spoil a meal).

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Final Compost (High, 13 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Zone; Stacking: No.}{A handful of grave dirt.}{Accelerate decay within a zone.

This could be a fertile patch of land, a unique alchemical ingredient, or a temporary, beneficial environmental feature.

\textit{Requires: Familiar + Codex + Tier III. Invoke: 2 Boons. Obligation: 6 segments.}
\end{rite}

\section{The Gallows-Bell: Consequences and Retribution}

Every action echoes. The Gallows-Bell is the patron of these echoes—the inevitable consequences that return like a tolling bell. Its domain is not punishment, but balance; not vengeance, but the restoration of cosmic equilibrium. Its followers are judges, avengers, and those who believe that debts must be paid, whether in this life or the next. To bargain with the Bell is to become an instrument of fate's reckoning, but those who ring the bell too often may find themselves standing beneath it.

\section{The Sealed Gate: Banishment, Wards, and Seals}

Some things should not be in this world. The Sealed Gate is the patron of this fundamental truth—the power to say "no" to the unnatural, to reinforce boundaries, to keep the Outside out. Its followers are exorcists, wardens, and guardians who stand at the thresholds between worlds. To bargain with the Gate is to become a living lock, but every seal requires maintenance, and the pressure from the other side never ceases.

\subsection{Low-Power Rites}

\begin{rite}{Rite of the Marked Boundary (Low, 4 XP)}{Duration: Scene; Range: Zone; Stacking: No.}{Chalk mixed with salt; drawn sigil at threshold.}{+2 dice to resist entry by marked supernatural threat type; create visible ward that deters 1-2 SB worth of minor entities.}{Ward also alerts you when triggered by a mental ping, but the ward's magic attracts the attention of other supernatural entities.}

\section*{The Oath of Flame and Light}

Some pacts are made not with alien entities, but with principles of purity and protection. The Oath of Flame and Light represents this sacred tradition—a binding vow to stand against corruption and darkness. Its followers are paladins, healers, and guardians who wield light as both weapon and ward.

\subsection{Rites of the Oath}

\begin{rite}{Lay on Hands of Ember (Low, 6 XP)}{Duration: Action; Range: Touch; Stacking: Yes (healing/warding only).}{The Symbol warmed over a true flame while the Familiar intones a vow of care.}{Choose one: \textbf{(a)} \emph{Step down} one level of \emph{mundane or shadow-touched Harm} on the target, \textbf{or} \textbf{(b)} \emph{clear 1 Fatigue} from the target, \textbf{or} \textbf{(c)} grant the target \emph{start Controlled} on their next Resist vs fear/corruption this scene.}{Also remove one minor lingering condition tied to dread or pain (\emph{Shaken}, \emph{Rattled}, etc.), but you take on a portion of the target's suffering.}
