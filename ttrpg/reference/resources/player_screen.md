# 🎲 Fate's Edge — Player Quick Sheet

---

## 🧩 Core Action
1. Describe what you do.
2. Build Pool = Attribute + Skill.
3. Roll d10s. Count:
   - 6–9 = 1 success
   - 10 = 2 successes (critical)
   - 1 = Story Beat (SB) for GM
4. Compare to DV (Difficulty Value):
   - 2 = Easy
   - 3 = Standard
   - 4 = Hard
   - 5+ = Extreme

**[TAGS Note]:** When using magic, describe your effect with 1-6 TAGS (e.g., "Burning • Area • Force"). DV = 1 + number of TAGS.

---

## ⚖️ Position (Risk Level)
- Dominant → Re-roll 1 failure
- Controlled → Roll as-is
- Desperate → Must re-roll 1 success

---

## 🎯 Outcomes
- S ≥ DV, C=0: Clean success (Standard Effect)
- S ≥ DV, C>0: Success with Cost (SB spent)
- S < DV, C=0: Partial (Limited Effect + SB)
- S = 0: Failure (No Effect + SB)

**[TAGS Effect]:** When you use multiple TAGS, GM may spend extra SB for narrative effects matching those TAGS.

---

## 🎭 Boons (Your Edge)
- Spend 1 Boon to:
  - Re-roll 1 die
  - Improve Position +1
  - Activate gear/asset creatively
  - Spend 2 Boons → 1 XP (max 2/session)
- Gain Boons through Miss & Partial success, Inspire, talents, bonds, criticals, or fiction.
- Hold max 5; trim to 2 at scene end.
- **[TAGS Note]:** Boons can help mitigate negative TAG effects or enhance key TAGS.

---

## ✨ Special Actions
- **Push Yourself:** Take Fatigue +1 (and/or Corruption for Casters) to add +1 die or resolve Song immediately.
- **Help/Setup:** Give ally +1 die or improve their Position.
- **Inspire (Support):** Share Boons, boost Position, rally allies.
- **[TAGS Action]:** When describing magic, name 1-6 relevant TAGS to clarify your intent and effects.

## 🔖 [TAGS] Quick Guide

**What are TAGS?**  
Short descriptors that define your magic's effect (e.g., [Burning], [Area], [Force])

**How to Use Them:**  
1. When casting, describe your effect with TAGS: "I unleash Burning • Area • Force against the marauders"
2. DV = 1 + number of TAGS (max 6)
3. Dangerous TAGS like [TELEPORT] add +2 DV instead of +1

**Common TAGS:**  
- **Elements:** [FIRE], [WATER], [EARTH], [AIR]
- **Combat:** [STRIKE], [AREA], [FORCE]
- **Ritual:** [WARD], [BANISH], [REVEAL]
- **Movement:** [LEAP], [FOLD], [GATE]

**Pro Tip:** The more specific your TAGS, the clearer the narrative effect - but more TAGS mean higher risk!

---

## ❤️ Harm
- Harm 1–2: −1 die on related actions
- Harm 3–4: Severe (downtime needed)
- Harm 5: Incapacitated

Resist: Roll Attribute vs DV 3 to downgrade harm.

---

## 💨 Fatigue
- F1: Re-roll 1 success on next roll
- F2: Re-roll 1 success on each significant roll
- F3: Re-roll 2 successes; collapse risk
- Clear: Short Rest (−1), Night's Rest (−2)

---

## ✨ Advancing (XP)
- Earn XP: Risks, roleplay, GM beats, Boon convert
- Spend XP: Unlock talents, advance archetypes (Specialist, Leader, Mastermind, etc.)

---

## 🃏 What's the Deck?

GM may flip cards when:
- A Desperate roll succeeds with cost
- Multiple SB spent at once
- Major stakes unresolved

Each suit = type of fallout:
- Spades: Harm / danger
- Hearts: Social fallout
- Clubs: Supply / fatigue
- Diamonds: Magic / corruption

**[TAGS Note]:** The GM may use suit meanings to guide how your TAGS manifest in complications.

---

## ✅ Your job as a player:
- Drive fiction with bold actions.
- Watch Position and Fatigue.
- Spend Boons smartly.
- Accept GM's SB spends as fuel for drama.
- **[TAGS Tip]:** Use TAGS to help the GM understand your magic's narrative role - the clearer your description, the better the outcome!
