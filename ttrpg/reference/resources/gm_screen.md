📜 Fate’s Edge GM Screen (Quick Reference)

⸻

🎲 Core Loop

Approach → Roll (d10s) → Outcome → SB Spend
	•	Dice Pool = Attribute + Skill
	•	Success = 6+ (10 counts as 2 successes)
	•	1 = Story Beat (SB) (GM complication currency)

⸻

⚖️ Position Effects

Position	Roll Effect	Fictional Meaning
Dominant	Re-roll 1 failure (below 6)	You act on your terms; safe & strong.
Controlled	No rerolls	Success is possible; failure has costs.
Desperate	Must re-roll 1 success (6+)	Odds against you; drama, danger, big fallout.


⸻

🎯 Difficulty Value (DV) Ladder
	•	2 = Routine / Easy (low threat)
	•	3 = Standard / Skilled Opponent
	•	4 = Hard / Elite Opposition
	•	5+ = Extreme / Set-Piece Challenge

Default by Position:
	•	Dominant = DV 2
	•	Controlled = DV 3
	•	Desperate = DV 4–5+

⸻

⚡ Story Beats (SB)
	•	Generated by player rolls (1s)
	•	Spent by GM to drive the fiction

Spend Menu:
	•	1 SB = Minor pressure (alarm, time loss, supply tick)
	•	2 SB = Moderate setback (lose cover, small foe arrives)
	•	3 SB = Major trouble (reinforcements, key gear breaks)
	•	4+ SB = Dramatic shift (trap, authority arrives, scene changes)

⸻

❤️ Harm & 💨 Fatigue

Harm Track (injury):
	•	Harm 1–2 → −1 die on related rolls
	•	Harm 3–4 → Severe; action disrupted, downtime required
	•	Harm 5 → Incapacitated

Fatigue Track (exhaustion):
	•	F1 → Minor: must re-roll 1 success on spells/strenuous rolls
	•	F2 → Serious: re-roll 2 successes; skills falter
	•	F3 → Collapse: disrupted actions, no spells/rites, forced rest
	•	Clear Fatigue: Short Rest = −1, Night’s Rest = −2

⸻

🎭 Boons (Player Currency)
	•	1 Boon = Re-roll 1 die
	•	1 Boon = Activate on-screen asset
	•	1 Boon = Improve Position by +1 step (max +1/action)
	•	2 Boons = Convert to 1 XP (max 2/session)

🃏 Deck of Consequences

Use a standard 52-card deck when SB hits hard.

Suits = Type of Complication:
	•	Spades: Harm / Danger
	•	Hearts: Social / Reputation
