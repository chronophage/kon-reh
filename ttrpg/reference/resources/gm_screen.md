# 📜 Fate's Edge GM Screen (Quick Reference)

---

## 🎲 Core Loop

**Approach → Roll (d10s) → Outcome → SB Spend**  
*Dice Pool = Attribute + Skill*  
*Success = 6+ (10 counts as 2 successes)*  
*1 = Story Beat (SB) (GM complication currency)*  

**[TAGS Note]:** In freeform magic, add 1 to DV for each TAG used (max +2 for dangerous TAGS)

---

## ⚖️ Position Effects

| Position | Roll Effect | Fictional Meaning |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Dominant | Re-roll 1 failure (below 6) | You act on your terms; safe & strong |
| Controlled | No rerolls | Success is possible; failure has costs |
| Desperate | Must re-roll 1 success (6+) | Odds against you; drama, danger, big fallout |

## 🎯 Difficulty Value (DV) Ladder

*2 = Routine / Easy (low threat)*  
*3 = Standard / Skilled Opponent*  
*4 = Hard / Elite Opposition*  
*5+ = Extreme / Set-Piece Challenge*

**Default by Position:**  
*Dominant = DV 2*  
*Controlled = DV 3*  
*Desperate = DV 4–5+*

**[TAGS Effect]:**  
- Each TAG adds +1 DV (max +2 for dangerous TAGS like [TELEPORT], [DOMINATE])
- [TAGS] can reduce DV by -1 if narrative supports it

---

## ⚡ Story Beats (SB)

*Generated by player rolls (1s)*  
*Spent by GM to drive the fiction*

**Spend Menu:**  
- 1 SB = Minor pressure (alarm, time loss, supply tick)  
- 2 SB = Moderate setback (lose cover, small foe arrives)  
- 3 SB = Major trouble (reinforcements, key gear breaks)  
- 4+ SB = Dramatic shift (trap, authority arrives, scene changes)  

---

## ❤️ Harm & 💨 Fatigue

**Harm Track (injury):**  
- Harm 1–2 → −1 die on related rolls  
- Harm 3–4 → Severe; action disrupted, downtime required  
- Harm 5 → Incapacitated  

**Fatigue Track (exhaustion):**  
- F1 → Minor: must re-roll 1 success on spells/strenuous rolls  
- F2 → Serious: re-roll 2 successes; skills falter  
- F3 → Collapse: disrupted actions, no spells/rites, forced rest  
- Clear Fatigue: Short Rest = −1, Night's Rest = −2  

---

## 🎭 Boons (Player Currency)

*1 Boon = Re-roll 1 die*  
*1 Boon = Activate on-screen asset*  
*1 Boon = Improve Position by +1 step (max +1/action)*  
*2 Boons = Convert to 1 XP (max 2/session)*  
*Power: Fuel Rites / Talents*  

**Limits:** Hold max 5; trim to 2 at scene end.  
**[TAGS Note]:** Boons can help mitigate negative TAG effects

---

## 🃏 Deck of Consequences

**Use a standard 52-card deck when SB hits hard.**

**Suits = Type of Complication:**  
- Spades: Harm / Danger  
- Hearts: Social / Reputation  
- Clubs: Resources / Fatigue  
- Diamonds: Arcane / Mystical  

**When to Draw:**  
- Desperate success with cost  
- GM spends 2+ SB in a single move  
- End of round with unresolved tension  

**[TAGS Tip]:** Use suit meanings to guide how [TAGS] complications manifest

## 📋 GM Flow (Scene Procedure)

1. **Frame stakes:** Position + Effect + Cost of failure  
2. **Set DV:** Based on Position + fiction (add +1 for each TAG used)  
3. **Roll:** Attribute + Skill pool  
4. **Count:** 6+ successes, 10s double, 1s = SB  
5. **Resolve:** Apply Outcome Matrix  
6. **Spend SB:** Complications, Deck draws, clock ticks  
7. **Shift Position:** Fictional consequences or Boons  

**[TAGS Note]:** For magic, note relevant TAGS when setting DV

## 🕒 Clocks

*4 segments: Quick challenge*  
*6 segments: Standard scene*  
*8 segments: Extended struggle*  
*10 segments: Epic / high risk*  

**Use to track:** enemy waves, collapsing ruins, social resistance, supply, corruption.  
**[TAGS Note]:** Certain TAGS (like [WARD] or [BANISH]) can advance or hold clocks

## 🔖 [TAGS] Quick Reference

**Core System:** Narrative shorthand for magical effects

**How to Use:**
