\label{sec:ubral-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}

\item Feud rekindled---a cousin spits on guest-law; knives wake up.
\item Bridge dropped---your pursuers fall... and your route with them.
\item Black-rent demand---``privateering on land''; pay or be ``escorted.''
\item Wergild breach---silver short by a head; tempers long by a spear.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:ubral-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (oaths/rights/tokens) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo upland motifs---horns, heather, stone---in later scenes for cohesion.
\item If any A appears, echo stone \& horn motifs---cairns that watch, horns that carry, and stone that remembers every footfall.
\end{itemize}
