\section{Ubral --- ``The Stone Between Spears''}
\label{chap:ubral}

\subsection*{Elite (Lady of Tor)}
\textit{``The stone here remembers every oath sworn upon it and every blood spilled in its shadow. To lead is to understand that the land itself is the true sovereign, and we are merely its stewards.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Hearth-aunt who holds guest-cup and house's temper)}
\textit{``Hospitality's a sacred thing in these hills – break bread at my table and you're family till the sun sets twice. But cross that trust and the very stones will remember your name.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Ubral is a land of upland mists, stone cairns, and clan oaths held tighter than iron. Caught between the Aelerian mountains and the lowland courts of Viterra, its hills are scarred by old raids and crowned by watch-fires that speak faster than any rider. Here, law is written not in charters but in cattle, wergild, and songs; here, a guest's word can buy more than a sword, but one broken vow can spark a feud lasting generations. Dwarves of Khaz-Vurim guard their mountain steps with tolls and grim patience, while clans hold their moots in hollows where voices echo long after speakers fall silent. Ubral is the stone between spears: a land of pride, passage, and peril.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:ubral-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (oaths/rights/tokens) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{stone \& spear} motifs---cairns that watch, voices that echo, and oaths that cut deeper than steel.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Guest-Law}: Breaking hospitality stains name worse than breaking sword. Guest-right tokens guarantee shelter, but abuse invites blood feud.
\item \textbf{Wergild System}: Every injury has price in cattle or coin. Wergild counters keep tallies that outlive the injured; debts pass to kin.
\item \textbf{Dwarf Toll Roads}: Khaz-Vurim gates charge for passage, but their roads are sure and swift. Pass-rings grant priority, but dwarf law is strict.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Ubral, power flows through clan bonds, guest-right, and the careful balance of honor and iron. Clan chiefs maintain authority through wergild, moots, and the respect of their people, while the dwarves of Khaz-Vurim wield influence through their control of mountain passes and trade routes. Law is personal and passed down through generations, with each oath and debt creating a web of obligation that can last centuries.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Ubral revolves around hospitality, protection, and the resolution of feuds. Rewards often take the form of tokens, charters, or safe passage that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, bracelets, writs) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival clans issue conflicting protections, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the moots, hill-forts, and watch-fires as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of custom and kinship determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Ubral, your word is your bond, and your bond determines whether you walk in peace or peril.

% ====== UBRAL: PLUG-IN EXTENSIONS (OATHS, FEUDS, WATCHFIRES, DWARF TOLLS) ======

\subsection*{Extensions (Plug-in)}
\label{sec:ubral-extensions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Oath Dial (Honor \(\leftrightarrow\) Cunning):} Track how the party navigates Ubral norms.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Honor High:} +1 Position when invoking guest-right, keeping truce, or paying wergild promptly; first ambush/raid action each session starts one step worse.
    \item \emph{Cunning High:} +1 Effect on raids, evasions, and border tricks; first formal parley or oath-bound request each session starts one step worse.
    \item Center the dial by restoring stolen cattle, hosting an enemy well, or submitting to a cairn ruling.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Feud Math (fast settlement):} Lay three markers: \textbf{Blood}, \textbf{Beasts}, \textbf{Blame}.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Make a single \emph{Parley/Command/Study} roll per side. On a hit, move one marker to your side; great Effect moves two.
    \item Win any two to settle: \emph{Blood} = oath/hostage, \emph{Beasts} = wergild in cattle/coin, \emph{Blame} = public apology/verse.
    \item Miss: mark \emph{Feud-Smoke} [4]. At 4, the losing side names a lawful target (bridge, herd, guide).
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Guest-Right Procedure (table safety in fiction):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Present a \textbf{Guest-Token} (or bread and salt). Host must choose: \emph{Shelter}, \emph{Escort at Dawn}, or \emph{Neutral Meal}.
    \item Breaking it creates \emph{Blood-Oath} [6] against the violator; any Ubral ally may spend 1 \Diamond{} to tick it twice.
    \item Abiding it clears 1 tick from \emph{Feud-Smoke} and grants +1d to the next social action in that steading.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Watchfire Net (ridge signals mini-game):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Two clocks: \emph{Beat the Beacons} vs \emph{Ridge Aflame} (size by highest rank in your seed).
    \item Choose a lane each exchange: \emph{Low Fold} (slow, stealth), \emph{Sheepwalk} (tricky, quick), \emph{Road} (fast, obvious).
    \item Advantage: Low Fold\(\,\triangleright\,\)Road (conceal), Road\(\,\triangleright\,\)Sheepwalk (speed), Sheepwalk\(\,\triangleright\,\)Low Fold (shortcuts).
    \item \emph{False Alarm (1 SB):} light or douse a misleading brazier; shift one segment between the two clocks.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Reiver Ride (mounted chase beats):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Track \emph{Remounts} (3): each push for speed trades 1 remount for +1d or +1 Effect. At 0, gain \emph{Blown Mounts} condition.
    \item \emph{Hag-Stone Cut}: pass a known gap (Sheepwalk Ledge, Droppers’ Bridge) to force pursuers to roll or fall behind.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Khaz-Vurim Protocol (dwarf road playbook):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Present any two: \textbf{Pass-Ring}, \textbf{Stamped Load-List}, \textbf{Named Sponsor}. Two = safe passage; one = pay toll + scrutiny; none = delay and search.
    \item \emph{Stone-Clause} may override one dwarf law once; afterwards start \emph{Ledger Notice} [3] with the wardens (prices rise, patience falls).
    \item \emph{Tally Truth}: you may substitute exact weights/measures for charm or coin to improve Position by one step with dwarves.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Bride-Peace Interlude (conflict pause):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Play a \textbf{Bride-Charter} to suspend violence at a scene. Everyone sheaths—or earns \emph{Song Shame} [4]. When it fills, a skald memorializes the insult (ongoing -1d with that clan).
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Start-of-Scene Omens in Ubral (1d6):}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Clear Ridge}: first signal test gains +1d.
    \item \emph{Lowing Herd}: +1d to tracking or herding; -1d to stealth near cattle.
    \item \emph{Wet Stone}: climbs start one step worse; mending gear is easier (free repair tick).
    \item \emph{Old Verse Remembered}: first oath/plea gains +1d if spoken in rhyme.
    \item \emph{Border Drums}: Viterra patrols near; papers safer, raiding harsher.
    \item \emph{Dwarf Toll Day}: prices firm; any \Diamond{} tied to roads counts double value at Steps.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Plug-in SB Conversions (Ubral flavor):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 1 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Mud and Heather}: footing worsens; next physical action -1d or mark \emph{Winded}.
    \item 2 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Kin Arrive}: add a rival cousin/ally who changes the ask or splits the pot.
    \item 3+ SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Cairn Decrees}: a standing stone “speaks” (witnesses recall the law); swap one held \Diamond{} for a lesser right until you make amends.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Reputation Echoes:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Guest-Faithful}: once/session downgrade a social backlash inside a steading; next time you refuse hospitality, mark \emph{Feud-Smoke} +1.
    \item \emph{Reiver-Favored}: +1 Effect to seize cattle/contraband on the move; city gates start one step worse Position.
    \item \emph{Stone-Friend}: +1d with dwarf wardens on roads; any false measure triggers \emph{Ledger Notice} +1.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
% ====== UBRAL: BOSS HOOKS & EXTRA FLOURISHES ======

\subsection*{Boss Hooks (Field Lords \& Oathbreakers)}
\label{sec:ubral-bosses}
% Each is tuned for an 8–10 clock unless an Ace was drawn (then 10). Offer their "levers" to soften or reshape the fight.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Wolf-Road Captain} (reiver-king on a piebald mare) --- \emph{Tells:} horn-calls that echo twice, wolf-skins braided into reins. \emph{Moves:} \emph{Ride-Through} (breaks line and steals a clock segment), \emph{Torch the Fold} (forces a lane change to Road), \emph{Laugh in Rain} (ignores first terrain penalty). \emph{Levers:} \textbf{Watch-Code} or \textbf{Guide's Braid} reduces his effect by one step for a scene. \emph{Yield Terms:} safe-conduct home for his sworn, or a night to drive cattle for wergild.
  \item \textbf{The Bride-Thief of Black Broom} (mask of bog-rush, vows like nettles) --- \emph{Tells:} will-lights knot into a veil, footprints fill with dark water. \emph{Moves:} \emph{Switch the Bride} (swap targets), \emph{Bog Embrace} (mark \emph{Winded} or lose footing), \emph{Nettle Oath} (binds a PC to inaction for a beat unless they cut a ribbon). \emph{Levers:} play a \textbf{Bride-Charter} to freeze blades; a \textbf{Well-Blessing} nulls \emph{Bog Embrace} once. \emph{Defeat:} return the true veil, speak the ninth unsaid \emph{without} naming it (cost: 1 tick to \emph{Feud-Smoke}).
  \item \textbf{Stone Auditor of Khaz-Vurim} (dwarf toll-magistrate with ledger-rod) --- \emph{Tells:} iron nails tapped to count, road studs hum. \emph{Moves:} \emph{Double the Toll} (swap one held \Diamond{} for a lesser), \emph{Weigh the Lie} (expose falsified paper), \emph{Seal the Switchback} (force lane: Sheepwalk $\rightarrow$ Road). \emph{Levers:} present two of \{\textbf{Pass-Ring}, \textbf{Stamped Load-List}, \textbf{Named Sponsor}\} to downgrade his effect. \emph{Yield Terms:} a year-and-a-day of honest weights, or ceding a \textbf{Road Commission}.
  \item \textbf{The Oath-Eater Wight} (cairn-bound revenant) --- \emph{Tells:} breath frosts verse, stones “answer.” \emph{Moves:} \emph{Take the Word} (erase one social success), \emph{Cold of Cairn} (apply \emph{Chill} condition), \emph{Bind Witness} (NPC cannot lie this scene). \emph{Levers:} \textbf{Oath-Bracelet} or speaking a skald’s stanza over bread and blood cancels \emph{Take the Word} once. \emph{Release:} repay an ancestral wergild or carry its stone to the proper mound.
  \item \textbf{Grey-Tor Hedge-Witch} (heather crown, ash staff) --- \emph{Tells:} smoke curls the wrong way, sheep stare. \emph{Moves:} \emph{Weather-Turn} (introduce \textbf{Snow-Squall} at half strength), \emph{Hag-Stone Sight} (ignore stealth), \emph{Bind the Gate} (Grey Tor’s \textbf{Shelter Writ} won’t open). \emph{Levers:} gift a \textbf{Bloom Allotment} or a winter’s salt; a \textbf{Council Audience} compels parley. \emph{End:} accept her geas (minor flaw) or uproot the ash and owe the hill (start \emph{Feud-Smoke} [2]).
  \item \textbf{The Three-Fires Provost} (watchfire war-chief) --- \emph{Tells:} oil-braided beard, pitch-spattered hands. \emph{Moves:} \emph{Raise the Ridge} (advance \emph{Ridge Aflame}), \emph{Seize the Road} (impose \emph{General Watch} tag), \emph{Beacon Oath} (any lie near a fire costs 1 Fatigue). \emph{Levers:} \textbf{Watch-Code} flips one of his moves to yours once; a public \emph{Blame} at moot steals his command die.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Boss Loot \& Boons (pick 1 on victory)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Wolf’s Horn:} once/arc convert 1 SB into \emph{False Alarm}.
  \item \emph{Veil of Broom:} ignore \emph{Upland Mist} penalties for one scene.
  \item \emph{Ledger-Rod:} once/session treat a \textbf{Dwarf Toll Hike} as \emph{controlled}.
  \item \emph{Cairn-Shard:} cash as a one-use \textbf{Oath-Bracelet}.
  \item \emph{Ash Rune:} mark a \textsc{Ward} on a gate; cancels the first \emph{Bridge Dropped}.
  \item \emph{Pitch Token:} light a signal counted as lawful; gain \textbf{Watch-Code} for the scene.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Legendary Sites \& Trials}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Sheepwalk Ledge Trial} --- speak one honest lie to pass: on success, set Position one step safer for the next border scene; on failure, start \emph{Kin Arrive}.
  \item \textbf{Wergild Ford Weighing} --- cast silver on table-rock: if paid in full, clear 1 \emph{Feud-Smoke}; if short, \emph{Wergild Breach} enters play.
  \item \textbf{Pass of Ashes Vigil} --- hold fire through the night storm: success grants \textbf{Shelter Writ}; a miss summons the \emph{Oath-Eater Wight} at weak strength.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Bounties \& Prestige Tracks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cairn-Marks} (prestige): keep a tally of cairns that “speak” for you. At 3 marks, treat one \textbf{Council Audience} as automatic. Lose 1 if you break guest-law publicly.
  \item \textbf{Reiver Tallies} (bounty): each seized herd or foiled raid adds 1; at 3+, reivers pool to field the \textbf{Wolf-Road Captain}. Pay down with cattle or a peace-feast.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cross-Region Boss Entanglements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Viterra Provost Warrant:} the \textbf{Three-Fires Provost} is deputized; defeating him triggers \emph{Royal Incursion}.
  \item \emph{Theona Bride-Peace Fracture:} slaying the \textbf{Bride-Thief} without rite starts \emph{Green Host Rides} at low strength on neighboring moors.
  \item \emph{Khaz-Vurim Ledger Chain:} outwitting the \textbf{Stone Auditor} begins a quiet \emph{Ledger Notice} [3] that follows you across dwarf roads.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Boss Procedure (quick frame)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Stage the Ground:} choose a lane (Low Fold / Sheepwalk / Road) and 1 ambient \emph{Clubs}.
  \item \textbf{Show the Lever:} place one relevant \Diamond{} within reach (token, writ, right).
  \item \textbf{Mark the Name:} announce what the hills will remember if the party cheats (start a \emph{Song Shame} or \emph{Blood-Oath} clock at [2]).
  \item \textbf{Let the Stones Speak:} on any miss, offer an honor bargain (mercy, hostage, cattle) that clears 1 harm/condition if accepted.
\end{enumerate}
