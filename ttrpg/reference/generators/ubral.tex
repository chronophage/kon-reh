\section{Ubral --- ``The Stone Between Spears''}
\label{chap:ubral}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Ubral is a land of upland mists, stone cairns, and clan oaths held tighter than iron. Caught between the Aelerian mountains and the lowland courts of Viterra, its hills are scarred by old raids and crowned by watch-fires that speak faster than any rider. Here, law is written not in charters but in cattle, wergild, and songs; here, a guest's word can buy more than a sword, but one broken vow can spark a feud lasting generations. Dwarves of Khaz-Vurim guard their mountain steps with tolls and grim patience, while clans hold their moots in hollows where voices echo long after speakers fall silent. Ubral is the stone between spears: a land of pride, passage, and peril.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:ubral-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (oaths/rights/tokens) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{stone \& spear} motifs---cairns that watch, voices that echo, and oaths that cut deeper than steel.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Guest-Law}: Breaking hospitality stains name worse than breaking sword. Guest-right tokens guarantee shelter, but abuse invites blood feud.
\item \textbf{Wergild System}: Every injury has price in cattle or coin. Wergild counters keep tallies that outlive the injured; debts pass to kin.
\item \textbf{Dwarf Toll Roads}: Khaz-Vurim gates charge for passage, but their roads are sure and swift. Pass-rings grant priority, but dwarf law is strict.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Ubral, power flows through clan bonds, guest-right, and the careful balance of honor and iron. Clan chiefs maintain authority through wergild, moots, and the respect of their people, while the dwarves of Khaz-Vurim wield influence through their control of mountain passes and trade routes. Law is personal and passed down through generations, with each oath and debt creating a web of obligation that can last centuries.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Ubral revolves around hospitality, protection, and the resolution of feuds. Rewards often take the form of tokens, charters, or safe passage that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, bracelets, writs) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival clans issue conflicting protections, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the moots, hill-forts, and watch-fires as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of custom and kinship determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Ubral, your word is your bond, and your bond determines whether you walk in peace or peril.
