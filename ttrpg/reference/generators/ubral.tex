\section{Ubral --- ``The Stone Between Spears''}
\label{chap:ubral}

\subsection*{Elite (Lady of Tor)}
\textit{``The stone here remembers every oath sworn upon it and every blood spilled in its shadow. To lead is to understand that the land itself is the true sovereign, and we are merely its stewards.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Hearth-aunt who holds guest-cup and house's temper)}
\textit{``Hospitality's a sacred thing in these hills – break bread at my table and you're family till the sun sets twice. But cross that trust and the very stones will remember your name.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Ubral is a land of upland mists, stone cairns, and clan oaths held tighter than iron. Caught between the Aelerian mountains and the lowland courts of Viterra, its hills are scarred by old raids and crowned by watch-fires that speak faster than any rider. Here, law is written not in charters but in cattle, wergild, and songs; here, a guest's word can buy more than a sword, but one broken vow can spark a feud lasting generations. Dwarves of Khaz-Vurim guard their mountain steps with tolls and grim patience, while clans hold their moots in hollows where voices echo long after speakers fall silent. Ubral is the stone between spears: a land of pride, passage, and peril.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:ubral-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (oaths/rights/tokens) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{stone \& spear} motifs---cairns that watch, voices that echo, and oaths that cut deeper than steel.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Guest-Law}: Breaking hospitality stains name worse than breaking sword. Guest-right tokens guarantee shelter, but abuse invites blood feud.
\item \textbf{Wergild System}: Every injury has price in cattle or coin. Wergild counters keep tallies that outlive the injured; debts pass to kin.
\item \textbf{Dwarf Toll Roads}: Khaz-Vurim gates charge for passage, but their roads are sure and swift. Pass-rings grant priority, but dwarf law is strict.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Ubral, power flows through clan bonds, guest-right, and the careful balance of honor and iron. Clan chiefs maintain authority through wergild, moots, and the respect of their people, while the dwarves of Khaz-Vurim wield influence through their control of mountain passes and trade routes. Law is personal and passed down through generations, with each oath and debt creating a web of obligation that can last centuries.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Ubral revolves around hospitality, protection, and the resolution of feuds. Rewards often take the form of tokens, charters, or safe passage that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, bracelets, writs) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival clans issue conflicting protections, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the moots, hill-forts, and watch-fires as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of custom and kinship determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Ubral, your word is your bond, and your bond determines whether you walk in peace or peril.

% ====== UBRAL: PLUG-IN EXTENSIONS (OATHS, FEUDS, WATCHFIRES, DWARF TOLLS) ======

\subsection*{Extensions (Plug-in)}
\label{sec:ubral-extensions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Oath Dial (Honor \(\leftrightarrow\) Cunning):} Track how the party navigates Ubral norms.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Honor High:} +1 Position when invoking guest-right, keeping truce, or paying wergild promptly; first ambush/raid action each session starts one step worse.
    \item \emph{Cunning High:} +1 Effect on raids, evasions, and border tricks; first formal parley or oath-bound request each session starts one step worse.
    \item Center the dial by restoring stolen cattle, hosting an enemy well, or submitting to a cairn ruling.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Feud Math (fast settlement):} Lay three markers: \textbf{Blood}, \textbf{Beasts}, \textbf{Blame}.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Make a single \emph{Parley/Command/Study} roll per side. On a hit, move one marker to your side; great Effect moves two.
    \item Win any two to settle: \emph{Blood} = oath/hostage, \emph{Beasts} = wergild in cattle/coin, \emph{Blame} = public apology/verse.
    \item Miss: mark \emph{Feud-Smoke} [4]. At 4, the losing side names a lawful target (bridge, herd, guide).
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Guest-Right Procedure (table safety in fiction):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Present a \textbf{Guest-Token} (or bread and salt). Host must choose: \emph{Shelter}, \emph{Escort at Dawn}, or \emph{Neutral Meal}.
    \item Breaking it creates \emph{Blood-Oath} [6] against the violator; any Ubral ally may spend 1 \Diamond{} to tick it twice.
    \item Abiding it clears 1 tick from \emph{Feud-Smoke} and grants +1d to the next social action in that steading.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Watchfire Net (ridge signals mini-game):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Two clocks: \emph{Beat the Beacons} vs \emph{Ridge Aflame} (size by highest rank in your seed).
    \item Choose a lane each exchange: \emph{Low Fold} (slow, stealth), \emph{Sheepwalk} (tricky, quick), \emph{Road} (fast, obvious).
    \item Advantage: Low Fold\(\,\triangleright\,\)Road (conceal), Road\(\,\triangleright\,\)Sheepwalk (speed), Sheepwalk\(\,\triangleright\,\)Low Fold (shortcuts).
    \item \emph{False Alarm (1 SB):} light or douse a misleading brazier; shift one segment between the two clocks.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Reiver Ride (mounted chase beats):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Track \emph{Remounts} (3): each push for speed trades 1 remount for +1d or +1 Effect. At 0, gain \emph{Blown Mounts} condition.
    \item \emph{Hag-Stone Cut}: pass a known gap (Sheepwalk Ledge, Droppers’ Bridge) to force pursuers to roll or fall behind.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Khaz-Vurim Protocol (dwarf road playbook):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Present any two: \textbf{Pass-Ring}, \textbf{Stamped Load-List}, \textbf{Named Sponsor}. Two = safe passage; one = pay toll + scrutiny; none = delay and search.
    \item \emph{Stone-Clause} may override one dwarf law once; afterwards start \emph{Ledger Notice} [3] with the wardens (prices rise, patience falls).
    \item \emph{Tally Truth}: you may substitute exact weights/measures for charm or coin to improve Position by one step with dwarves.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Bride-Peace Interlude (conflict pause):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Play a \textbf{Bride-Charter} to suspend violence at a scene. Everyone sheaths—or earns \emph{Song Shame} [4]. When it fills, a skald memorializes the insult (ongoing -1d with that clan).
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Start-of-Scene Omens in Ubral (1d6):}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Clear Ridge}: first signal test gains +1d.
    \item \emph{Lowing Herd}: +1d to tracking or herding; -1d to stealth near cattle.
    \item \emph{Wet Stone}: climbs start one step worse; mending gear is easier (free repair tick).
    \item \emph{Old Verse Remembered}: first oath/plea gains +1d if spoken in rhyme.
    \item \emph{Border Drums}: Viterra patrols near; papers safer, raiding harsher.
    \item \emph{Dwarf Toll Day}: prices firm; any \Diamond{} tied to roads counts double value at Steps.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Plug-in SB Conversions (Ubral flavor):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 1 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Mud and Heather}: footing worsens; next physical action -1d or mark \emph{Winded}.
    \item 2 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Kin Arrive}: add a rival cousin/ally who changes the ask or splits the pot.
    \item 3+ SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Cairn Decrees}: a standing stone “speaks” (witnesses recall the law); swap one held \Diamond{} for a lesser right until you make amends.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Reputation Echoes:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Guest-Faithful}: once/session downgrade a social backlash inside a steading; next time you refuse hospitality, mark \emph{Feud-Smoke} +1.
    \item \emph{Reiver-Favored}: +1 Effect to seize cattle/contraband on the move; city gates start one step worse Position.
    \item \emph{Stone-Friend}: +1d with dwarf wardens on roads; any false measure triggers \emph{Ledger Notice} +1.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
