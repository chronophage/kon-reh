\section{Black Banners --- ``Condotta \& Crowns''}
\label{chap:black-banners}

\subsection*{Elite (Banner-captain with griffon standard and a ledger of noble grudges)}
\textit{``A contract is only as good as the next payday, and a grudge is only as sharp as the sword backing it. In this game, we sell steel by the season and vendettas by the year.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Veteran sergeant who counts scars like coins)}
\textit{``I've seen three captains rise and fall in the time it takes to grow a beard, but the mud stays the same and the pay comes when it pleases. Best keep your own counsel and your blade sharp.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Condotta \& Crowns}]
Ecktorian treasuries bankroll a perpetual border-war they claim to be \emph{containing}. In truth, the gold keeps the fire burning. The Black Banners are mercenary leagues—ex-Utaran legionaries, second-sons, debt-dodgers, and exiles—who sell steel to the highest bidder, today's ally becoming tomorrow's quarry. Between them move the Ykrul steppe-clans (swift, pragmatic, oath-canny) and the Vilikari hill tribes (crafty, patient, and proud). Ecktorian ministers call it ``pressure management.'' The companies call it a season.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}

\item (Disgrace/Rebellion) Latrine row at dusk; mud, shame, whispered mutiny, and a sergeant who hears too well.
\item (Destruction/Regret) Crater pasture from an alchemical barrage; in spring, glass flowers sprout like guilt.
\item (Logistics/Desperation) Supply road with twelve broken wagons; oxen nose the wreckage for salt.
\item (Tension/Grudges) Half-raised siege tower in an abandoned camp; every rung creaks with grudges.
\item (Death/Corruption) Salt-cured cache behind the surgeon's tent; the wrong kind of maggots move.

\item (Death/Intimidation) Watch-tower stacked from skulls and slate; the crows know the countersign.
\item[J] (Nostalgia/Honor) Ancient march-keep held by a skeleton garrison of veterans; they remember when the banners were gold.
\item[Q] (Diplomacy/Death) The Bone Fields---where Ykrul elders parley among cairns and reckon oaths with the dead.
\item[K] (Military/Defense) Marcher's Fortress---three walls, two sieges' scars, one gate that opens inward only.

\item[K] (Strategy/Manipulation) Vilikari High Chief who trades mercenaries like game pieces and never tips the board.

\item[Q] (Diplomacy/Delay) Clan-Mother calls a blood-feast; all contracts suspended until dawn's judgment.
\item[K] (Manipulation/Competition) High Chief plays companies against each other; ``winner'' takes obligations, not spoils.

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (contracts, claims, dispensations)}

\item[J] (Promotion/Responsibility) Field promotion warrant---assume command of a shattered unit, inherit its clocks.
\item[Q] (Military Alliance/Judgment) Clan-Mother's war-braids---her chosen will fight beside you this battle, then judge you after.
\item[K] (Commerce/Power) High Chief's trading charter---buy or sell \emph{anything} in any camp, no questions asked aloud.
\item[A] (Loyalty/Charisma) The Bannerless Word---loyalty that outruns rank, law, and coin.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:black-banners-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (contracts/claims/dispensations) that shift position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any Ace appears, echo war \& winter motifs---ice that keeps the dead, weapons that remember, loyalty that needs no banner.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Payday \& Supply Clocks:} Track two pressures common to the Black Banners: \textbf{Payday} (4-segment) and \textbf{Supply} (4-segment). When Payday fills, morale falters and the Keeper may peel away a squad or impose a desertion SB. When Supply fills, all risky maneuvers begin one step worse Position until the players secure fresh provisions or bargain a Diamond.
\item \textbf{Allegiances in Flux:} At the start of a scene, roll 1d6 to see if loyalties shift:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Condotta broker flips colors mid-parley.  
  \item Ykrul emissary offers better terms; accept and mark Obligation, or refuse and tick Payday.  
  \item Vilikari scouts reveal a shortcut; gain +1 Effect but risk SB from hostile terrain.  
  \item Ecktorian clerk ``corrects'' your orders; obey for +1 Position, defy and gain a Diamond but earn a Black Mark.  
  \item Rival captain spreads falsified orders; unless revealed, counters are harder this scene.  
  \item The Bannerless One's messengers arrive; accept their word to clear 1 Payday, but the Keeper gains 1 SB.  
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Honor vs.\ Pragmatism:} Place a two-step dial between \emph{Honor} and \emph{Pragmatism}.  
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Honor:} +1 Position in parley or oathbound actions; logistics costs rise faster.  
  \item \textbf{Pragmatism:} +1 Effect in ambushes or sabotage; parley begins one step worse Position.  
\end{itemize}
Center the dial by a symbolic act---repaying arrears, returning prisoners, or honoring a broken writ.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Mercenary Realpolitik}]
In the world of the Black Banners, loyalty is a currency that fluctuates with the market. A man's worth is measured not in noble blood or ancestral holdings, but in the sharpness of his blade and the reliability of his word. The condotta system creates a web of shifting allegiances where today's enemy may become tomorrow's employer, and a captain's true skill lies not in strategy alone but in reading the political winds that blow across contested borders. Between the rigid honor codes of Ecktorian nobility and the fluid pragmatism of steppe clans and hill tribes, mercenaries navigate a dangerous middle ground where survival depends on knowing when to keep an oath and when to break one.

\section*{Thematic SB Spend Table}
\label{sec:thematic-sb}

\subsection*{Minor Complications (1 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Exposure:} Your actions draw unwanted attention from [local authority/creature/faction]
\item \textbf{Noise:} Sounds of your actions alert nearby [enemies/critters/locals]
\item \textbf{Trace:} Evidence of your passage marks your route for trackers/followers
\item \textbf{Delay:} A brief but meaningful setback costs you [time/resources/opportunity]
\item \textbf{Supply Strain:} Mark +1 segment on a relevant resource clock
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Moderate Setbacks (2 SB)}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Foe Appears:} A [minor threat/rival/enemy] arrives on scene
\item \textbf{Gear Trouble:} A piece of equipment becomes [Compromised/Neglected]
\item \textbf{Lock/Barrier:} A simple obstacle now requires a test to overcome
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Serious Trouble (3 SB)}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Narrative Pivot:} The story takes an unexpected turn that reframes objectives
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Region-Specific SB Options}
Each region generator should include 2-3 custom SB spends that reflect its unique themes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Black Banners (War \& Betrayal):} False orders arrive, allies turn enemy, supply lines are cut without warning
\item \textbf{Black Banners (Mercenary Life):} Payday delayed again, equipment fails in combat, honor conflicts with survival
\item \textbf{Black Banners (Supernatural War):} Fallen weapons rise singing, ice preserves the dead too well, loyalty manifests as ghostly aid
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Black Banners — Condotta Crossroads}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A war‑camp crossroads where two banners snap in the same wind, their sigils bleeding into one another.
\begin{quote}
“In the lands of the Black Banners, loyalty is coin, and every signature stains red.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A war-camp crossroads, a Condotta broker with ink-stained fingers lays two contracts—one from Ecktoria, one from Ykrul. ``Pick a war. Pick a grave.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Mercenary charters, patron saints of loss, camp-plagues, blood-ink.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Take payment twice,'' ``Name a deserter,'' ``Torch the plague tent.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Skirmish Spiral''; Community: ``Camp Despair''; Anchor: ``Unit Cohesion.''
\paragraph{Complications} Scouts go missing; rations are cursed; saints’ icons weep pitch.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A veteran mentor; a field-chapel.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The banners swap colors in wind.
\paragraph{Relief} Broker a cease-fire; sanctify the plague ground; accept one charter and betray none.

% ====== EXTENSIONS ======

\subsection*{Faction Entanglements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Condotta Brokers’ Syndicate:} Register your charter and bank a \emph{Broker’s Favor}—spend to reduce one parley DV inside a war-camp. Skipping registration flags your unit with \emph{Unauthorized Colors}: the first checkpoint scene gains a free “False Orders” SB.
  \item \textbf{Camp Quartermasters:} Accept ration-scale audits to cancel the first \emph{Supply} tick this leg; refuse and mark a 4-segment \emph{Short Rations} clock that worsens Position on marches.
  \item \textbf{Field Chaplains \& Leech-Circles:} Donate time or tithe to clear 1 segment from \emph{Camp-Fever}; if ignored, the Keeper may convert the first 1 SB of a scene into “Disease/Death.”
  \item \textbf{Steppe Envoys:} Honor horse-rites (salt, water, shade) to gain \emph{Remount Rights}—once, treat a retreat as movement with +1 Effect. Break rites and add a \emph{Soured Oath} tag that raises parley DV with riders until cleansed.
  \item \textbf{Hill Truce-Holders:} Enter a stones-circle under their witness to bank a \emph{Blood-Truce}—spend to negate one ambush on hill roads. Violating the circle spawns a 4-segment \emph{Guest Right Forfeit} clock.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cross–Theater Ties \& Soft Power (Optional Hooks)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{River Prefects:} Stamp your manifests to drop crossing DV by 1 and gain a \emph{Bridge Priority} chit; late tolls convert the next logistics SB into “Lock/Barrier.”
  \item \textbf{City-State Factors:} Accept a neutral factor to reroll one market roll in camp, but start a 4-segment \emph{Price of Neutrality} clock (their cut grows, rivals notice).
  \item \textbf{Border Monasteries:} Carry bell-tokens to treat the first “Prisoners/Parley” scene as one step safer Position; burn bridges there and gain the \emph{No Sanctuary} tag across nearby forts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Trade Goods \& Consequences}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Salt \& Shot:} Delivering either clears 1 \emph{Supply}; flooding a front with both adds a roaming \emph{Black Market} clock that can flip a Club result to “Foe Appears.”
  \item \textbf{Winter Fodder \& Remounts:} Bank a \emph{Cold March} boon—once, ignore weather penalties on movement. Seizing fodder from locals adds a persistent \emph{Reprisal Tax} at village stops.
  \item \textbf{Plague Cordons:} Purchase \emph{Cordon Passes} to bypass one quarantine; forging them risks converting the next minor SB into “Alarm Raised.”
  \item \textbf{Siege Timber \& Powder:} Gain +1 Effect on assaults this session; mishandled stores let the Keeper auto-trigger “Key Gear Breaks” once.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Patron Networks (Optional, if in play)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Traveler:} Wayshrines along war-roads let you finish one travel clock tick for free after honoring safe-road rites.
  \item \textbf{Mykkiel:} A stamped writ turns one battlefield judgment (parley, surrender, exchange) into a codified Diamond for enforcement.
  \item \textbf{Maelstraeus:} Convert a resource at fair rate once per campaign phase (pay in Obligation if skewed); abuse invites a \emph{Karmic Debt} clock.
  \item \textbf{The Sealed Gate:} Chalked lines around a field HQ negate one intrusion or night raid this scene.
  \item \textbf{Varnek Karn:} Naming the dead settles a \emph{Fallen Oath}—clear 1 \emph{Payday} but bind your unit to a memorial duty.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Field Procedures (Use at the Table)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Colors \& Countersigns:} Declaring correct countersigns cancels the first “False Orders” SB each night; wrong signs worsen Position on first contact.
  \item \textbf{Payline Drill:} If a scene depicts orderly pay, clear 1 \emph{Payday}. If pay is “creative,” clear it but mark \emph{Black Mark}—future officers begin one step colder in parley.
  \item \textbf{Scavenge Doctrine:} After battles, you may gain 1 temporary Gear tag or advance \emph{Supply} by 1; on a 1–2 on 1d6, spawn “Honor vs.\ Pragmatism” conflict immediately.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Diplomatic Favor \& Reputation Echoes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mercenary Credit (minor resource):} Earned by rescuing allies, paying arrears, or holding the line; spend to downgrade one contract-friction Club result.
  \item \textbf{Marks:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \emph{Black Mark:} Faster requisitions from quartermasters, colder receptions from nobles.
      \item \emph{Steppe-Favored:} Easier horse trade, harder foot levy in farming towns.
      \item \emph{Hill-Trusted:} Safer passes, stricter scrutiny from fortress clerks.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
