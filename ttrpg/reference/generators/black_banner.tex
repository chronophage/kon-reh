\section{Black Banners --- ``Condotta \& Crowns'' Generator}
\label{chap:black-banners}

Ecktorian treasuries bankroll a perpetual border-war they claim to be \emph{containing}. In truth, the gold keeps the fire burning. The \index{Black Banners} Black Banners are mercenary leagues—ex-Utaran legionaries, second-sons, debt-dodgers, and exiles—who sell steel to the highest bidder, today’s ally becoming tomorrow’s quarry. Between them move the \index{Ykrul} Ykrul steppe-clans (swift, pragmatic, oath-canny) and the \index{Vilikari} Vilikari hill tribes (crafty, patient, and proud). Ecktorian ministers call it “pressure management.” The companies call it a season.

\subsection*{Spades --- Places (camps, battlefields, fortresses, war-roads)}
\label{sec:black-banners-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Burned village turned field-hospital; flies, tinctures, and fever-prayers.
\item Frozen ford; last month’s dead held under glass, standards trapped in the ice.
\item Latrine row at dusk; mud, shame, whispered mutiny, and a sergeant who hears too well.
\item Crater pasture from an alchemical barrage; in spring, glass flowers sprout like guilt.
\item Supply road with twelve broken wagons; oxen nose the wreckage for salt.
\item Half-raised siege tower in an abandoned camp; every rung creaks with grudges.
\item Salt-cured cache behind the surgeon’s tent; the wrong kind of maggots move.
\item Command tent where maps show borders that diplomacy has already erased.
\item Watch-tower stacked from skulls and slate; the crows know the countersign.
\item[J] Ancient march-keep held by a skeleton garrison of veterans; they remember when the banners were gold.
\item[Q] The Bone Fields—where Ykrul elders parley among cairns and reckon oaths with the dead.
\item[K] Marcher’s Fortress—three walls, two sieges’ scars, one gate that opens inward only.
\item[A] The Singing Wastes—fallen weapons hum with the voices of their last wielders on a wind that tastes of iron.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (captains, cadets, clans, tribes)}
\label{sec:black-banners-people}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Young cadet with a father’s sword and a mother’s debt.
\item Veteran sergeant who counts scars like coins—and spends them on whiskey and mercy.
\item Ecktorian banner-captain with griffon standard and a ledger of noble grudges.
\item Condotta broker who changes colors when the wind turns—but always lands on his feet.
\item Ykrul clan emissary who speaks in riddled proverbs and pays in copper and promises.
\item Vilikari war-chief’s second son; honor burns brighter than his father’s patience.
\item Surgeon who treats friend and foe alike; her ledger balances only in blood.
\item Quartermaster who knows where every coin went and every man will fall.
\item Tribune’s aide-de-camp with sealed orders that contradict the general’s intent.
\item[J] The Black Colonel—legendary commander not seen in the line for months, yet his banner still rides.
\item[Q] Ykrul Clan-Mother who weaves war-braids from the hair of oath-breakers.
\item[K] Vilikari High Chief who trades mercenaries like game pieces and never tips the board.
\item[A] The Bannerless One—commands loyalty without rank or flag; men follow because they \emph{want} to.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (betrayals, weather, politics, war)}
\label{sec:black-banners-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Payday delayed; supplies die before coin arrives.
\item False orders: your target is now your ally—on paper.
\item Blizzard pins two rival companies in the same cloister; vows and knives both come out.
\item Ykrul offer better terms than Ecktoria; your contract becomes a liability.
\item Condotta unit flips mid-battle; your “relief” hits your flank.
\item Camp-fever blooms; the surgeon’s tent turns into a counting-house for the dead.
\item Vilikari raiders cut your supply road; winter moves the schedule.
\item Ecktorian honor code collides with mercenary pragmatism; the camp splits by doctrine.
\item Tribune captured; the aide must choose: the rescue or the war.
\item[J] The Black Colonel’s banner appears on the wrong field; confusion is a weapon.
\item[Q] Clan-Mother calls a blood-feast; all contracts suspended until dawn’s judgment.
\item[K] High Chief plays companies against each other; “winner” takes obligations, not spoils.
\item[A] The Singing Wastes awaken; every fallen blade rises to seek its last hand.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (contracts, claims, dispensations)}
\label{sec:black-banners-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Emergency requisition—strip a fallen company for what you need (and their ghosts for what they’re owed).
\item Dual contract—serve two masters with goals that cannot both be met.
\item Honor dispensation—your acts are justified regardless of Ecktorian code (for now).
\item Condotta rider’s pass—cross any camp perimeter once, unchallenged.
\item Ykrul safe-conduct token—pass a named clan’s lands unmolested (until the moon changes).
\item Vilikari war-mark—their scouts guide you through hostile hills, and remember the favor.
\item Surgeon’s debt-note—medical care when no coin remains; the interest is names.
\item Tribune’s cipher ring—decode orders that do not exist yet.
\item Banner-captain’s seal—commandeer resources from junior companies (and their resentment).
\item[J] Field promotion warrant—assume command of a shattered unit, inherit its clocks.
\item[Q] Clan-Mother’s war-braid—her chosen will fight beside you this battle, then judge you after.
\item[K] High Chief’s trading charter—buy or sell \emph{anything} in any camp, no questions asked aloud.
\item[A] The Bannerless Word—loyalty that outruns rank, law, and coin.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Quick Use Notes}
\label{sec:black-banners-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (contracts/claims/dispensations) that shift position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any Ace appears, echo war \& winter motifs—ice that keeps the dead, weapons that remember, loyalty that needs no banner.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\label{sec:black-banners-minor}

\paragraph{Payday \& Supply Clocks}
Track two pressures common to the Black Banners: \textbf{Payday} (4-segment) and \textbf{Supply} (4-segment). When Payday fills, morale falters and the Keeper may peel away a squad or impose a desertion SB. When Supply fills, all risky maneuvers begin one step worse Position until the players secure fresh provisions or bargain a Diamond.

\paragraph{Allegiances in Flux}
At the start of a scene, roll 1d6 to see if loyalties shift:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Condotta broker flips colors mid-parley.  
  \item Ykrul emissary offers better terms; accept and mark Obligation, or refuse and tick Payday.  
  \item Vilikari scouts reveal a shortcut; gain +1 Effect but risk SB from hostile terrain.  
  \item Ecktorian clerk “corrects” your orders; obey for +1 Position, defy and gain a Diamond but earn a Black Mark.  
  \item Rival captain spreads falsified orders; unless revealed, counters are harder this scene.  
  \item The Bannerless One’s messengers arrive; accept their word to clear 1 Payday, but the Keeper gains 1 SB.  
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Honor vs.\ Pragmatism}
Place a two-step dial between \emph{Honor} and \emph{Pragmatism}.  
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Honor:} +1 Position in parley or oathbound actions; logistics costs rise faster.  
  \item \textbf{Pragmatism:} +1 Effect in ambushes or sabotage; parley begins one step worse Position.  
\end{itemize}
Center the dial by a symbolic act—repaying arrears, returning prisoners, or honoring a broken writ.
