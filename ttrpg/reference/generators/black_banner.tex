\section{Black Banners --- ``Condotta \& Crowns''}
\label{chap:black-banners}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Condotta \& Crowns}]
Ecktorian treasuries bankroll a perpetual border-war they claim to be \emph{containing}. In truth, the gold keeps the fire burning. The Black Banners are mercenary leagues—ex-Utaran legionaries, second-sons, debt-dodgers, and exiles—who sell steel to the highest bidder, today's ally becoming tomorrow's quarry. Between them move the Ykrul steppe-clans (swift, pragmatic, oath-canny) and the Vilikari hill tribes (crafty, patient, and proud). Ecktorian ministers call it ``pressure management.'' The companies call it a season.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Spades --- Places (camps, battlefields, fortresses, war-roads)}
\label{sec:black-banners-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item (Suffering/Medical) Burned village turned field-hospital; flies, tinctures, and fever-prayers.
\item (Death/Winter) Frozen ford; last month's dead held under glass, standards trapped in the ice.
\item (Disgrace/Rebellion) Latrine row at dusk; mud, shame, whispered mutiny, and a sergeant who hears too well.
\item (Destruction/Regret) Crater pasture from an alchemical barrage; in spring, glass flowers sprout like guilt.
\item (Logistics/Desperation) Supply road with twelve broken wagons; oxen nose the wreckage for salt.
\item (Tension/Grudges) Half-raised siege tower in an abandoned camp; every rung creaks with grudges.
\item (Death/Corruption) Salt-cured cache behind the surgeon's tent; the wrong kind of maggots move.
\item (Politics/Confusion) Command tent where maps show borders that diplomacy has already erased.
\item (Death/Intimidation) Watch-tower stacked from skulls and slate; the crows know the countersign.
\item[J] (Nostalgia/Honor) Ancient march-keep held by a skeleton garrison of veterans; they remember when the banners were gold.
\item[Q] (Diplomacy/Death) The Bone Fields---where Ykrul elders parley among cairns and reckon oaths with the dead.
\item[K] (Military/Defense) Marcher's Fortress---three walls, two sieges' scars, one gate that opens inward only.
\item[A] (Supernatural/War) The Singing Wastes---fallen weapons hum with the voices of their last wielders on a wind that tastes of iron.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}

\item[K] (Strategy/Manipulation) Vilikari High Chief who trades mercenaries like game pieces and never tips the board.

\item (Disease/Death) Camp-fever blooms; the surgeon's tent turns into a counting-house for the dead.
\item (Military Threat/Delay) Vilikari raiders cut your supply road; winter moves the schedule.
\item (Ideological Conflict/Division) Ecktorian honor code collides with mercenary pragmatism; the camp splits by doctrine.
\item (Crisis/Choice) Tribune captured; the aide must choose: the rescue or the war.
\item[J] (Confusion/Weapon) The Black Colonel's banner appears on the wrong field; confusion is a weapon.
\item[Q] (Diplomacy/Delay) Clan-Mother calls a blood-feast; all contracts suspended until dawn's judgment.
\item[K] (Manipulation/Competition) High Chief plays companies against each other; ``winner'' takes obligations, not spoils.

\item (Authority/Resentment) Banner-captain's seal---commandeer resources from junior companies (and their resentment).
\item[J] (Promotion/Responsibility) Field promotion warrant---assume command of a shattered unit, inherit its clocks.
\item[Q] (Military Alliance/Judgment) Clan-Mother's war-braids---her chosen will fight beside you this battle, then judge you after.
\item[K] (Commerce/Power) High Chief's trading charter---buy or sell \emph{anything} in any camp, no questions asked aloud.
\item[A] (Loyalty/Charisma) The Bannerless Word---loyalty that outruns rank, law, and coin.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:black-banners-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (contracts/claims/dispensations) that shift position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any Ace appears, echo war \& winter motifs---ice that keeps the dead, weapons that remember, loyalty that needs no banner.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Payday \& Supply Clocks:} Track two pressures common to the Black Banners: \textbf{Payday} (4-segment) and \textbf{Supply} (4-segment). When Payday fills, morale falters and the Keeper may peel away a squad or impose a desertion SB. When Supply fills, all risky maneuvers begin one step worse Position until the players secure fresh provisions or bargain a Diamond.
\item \textbf{Allegiances in Flux:} At the start of a scene, roll 1d6 to see if loyalties shift:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Condotta broker flips colors mid-parley.  
  \item Ykrul emissary offers better terms; accept and mark Obligation, or refuse and tick Payday.  
  \item Vilikari scouts reveal a shortcut; gain +1 Effect but risk SB from hostile terrain.  
  \item Ecktorian clerk ``corrects'' your orders; obey for +1 Position, defy and gain a Diamond but earn a Black Mark.  
  \item Rival captain spreads falsified orders; unless revealed, counters are harder this scene.  
  \item The Bannerless One's messengers arrive; accept their word to clear 1 Payday, but the Keeper gains 1 SB.  
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Honor vs.\ Pragmatism:} Place a two-step dial between \emph{Honor} and \emph{Pragmatism}.  
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Honor:} +1 Position in parley or oathbound actions; logistics costs rise faster.  
  \item \textbf{Pragmatism:} +1 Effect in ambushes or sabotage; parley begins one step worse Position.  
\end{itemize}
Center the dial by a symbolic act---repaying arrears, returning prisoners, or honoring a broken writ.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Mercenary Realpolitik}]
In the world of the Black Banners, loyalty is a currency that fluctuates with the market. A man's worth is measured not in noble blood or ancestral holdings, but in the sharpness of his blade and the reliability of his word. The condotta system creates a web of shifting allegiances where today's enemy may become tomorrow's employer, and a captain's true skill lies not in strategy alone but in reading the political winds that blow across contested borders. Between the rigid honor codes of Ecktorian nobility and the fluid pragmatism of steppe clans and hill tribes, mercenaries navigate a dangerous middle ground where survival depends on knowing when to keep an oath and when to break one.

\subsection*{Black Banners — Condotta Crossroads}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A war‑camp crossroads where two banners snap in the same wind, their sigils bleeding into one another.
\begin{quote}
“In the lands of the Black Banners, loyalty is coin, and every signature stains red.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A war-camp crossroads, a Condotta broker with ink-stained fingers lays two contracts—one from Ecktoria, one from Ykrul. ``Pick a war. Pick a grave.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Mercenary charters, patron saints of loss, camp-plagues, blood-ink.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Take payment twice,'' ``Name a deserter,'' ``Torch the plague tent.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Skirmish Spiral''; Community: ``Camp Despair''; Anchor: ``Unit Cohesion.''
\paragraph{Complications} Scouts go missing; rations are cursed; saints’ icons weep pitch.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A veteran mentor; a field-chapel.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The banners swap colors in wind.
\paragraph{Relief} Broker a cease-fire; sanctify the plague ground; accept one charter and betray none.
