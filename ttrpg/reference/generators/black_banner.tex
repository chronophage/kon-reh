\section*{Quick Use Notes}
\label{sec:black-banners-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (contracts/claims/dispensations) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo war \& winter motifs---weapons that remember, ice that holds the dead, and loyalty that needs no banner.
\end{itemize}
