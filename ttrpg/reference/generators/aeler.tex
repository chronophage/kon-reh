\section{Aeler (Dwarves) --- ``Crowns \& Under-Vaults''}
\label{chap:aeler}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Crowns \& Under-Vaults}]
The Aeler hold the mountains by breath, bell, and bargain. Their halls run like arteries, their cities open in thunderous caverns where bridges leap between ribs of stone and cisterns shine like night skies turned inward. \textit{Survival} is the first law: air is counted, water is barned, light is rationed by wick and prayer. \textit{Tradition} is the second: seals are kept, measures remain true, and the dead keep their offices as carefully as the living. Between the two, a people learn to argue quietly and build loudly.

Collectives (clans, guild-kin, lamp-companies) own what the mountain allows; individuals are custodians by oath. Trade runs under and over the range through under-ways and pass-forts, stitching protectorates and lowland markets to vaultmouth gates. When tunnels whisper or the air tastes wrong, the Aeler move as one animal; when the Kingsmoot calls, crowns and abbesses argue in bell-code and sealed writs until the stone itself seems to lean in.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:aeler-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: \textbf{Spade} = place, \textbf{Heart} = actor, \textbf{Club} = pressure, \textbf{Diamond} = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Treat \textbf{Diamonds} as codified outcomes (keys/passes/rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any \textbf{A} appears, echo stone \& breath motifs---keys click, bells answer, and the mountain listens (and remembers).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Count the Air:} When a scene establishes scarce air, a character who actively paces their breathing (counted steps, measured rests) may shift \emph{Position} one step safer on their next physical action in a confined space.
\item \textbf{Bell-Code Courtesy:} If the party adopts local bell etiquette (asking a warden which chime applies and heeding it), gain +1 assist die on negotiations or passage requests within a vault or under-market.
\item \textbf{Measure is Mercy:} Presenting a certified measure (rod, weight, sealed tally) calms a dispute: cancel the first SB generated by commerce or jurisdictional friction in the scene.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Stone \& Sovereignty}]
In the deep places, survival depends on precision and tradition. The Aeler understand that stone does not forgive error---a misread seal can mean death, a miscalculated air measure can doom an expedition, and a broken bell-code can spark jurisdictional war. Their society is built on layers of authority, each with its own rites, rights, and responsibilities. To navigate their realm is to learn a complex dance of deference and demand, where even the humblest lamplighter holds power over the darkness, and the smallest key can unlock the greatest vault.
