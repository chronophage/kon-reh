\section{Aeler (Dwarves) --- ``Crowns \& Under-Vaults''}
\label{chap:aeler}

\subsection*{Elite (Vault-Queen of a crownland)}
\textit{``The mountain remembers every word carved in its stone, every seal pressed into its walls. To govern here is not to command, but to harmonize with the ancient songs that still echo in the deep places.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Under-Mason who can hear stone shift a room away)}
\textit{``When the stone starts singing a different tune, you best listen. Three knocks in the morning means all's well, but three knocks at night means something's coming through the walls that wasn't meant to walk.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Crowns \& Under-Vaults}]
The Aeler hold the mountains by breath, bell, and bargain. Their halls run like arteries, their cities open in thunderous caverns where bridges leap between ribs of stone and cisterns shine like night skies turned inward. \textit{Survival} is the first law: air is counted, water is barned, light is rationed by wick and prayer. \textit{Tradition} is the second: seals are kept, measures remain true, and the dead keep their offices as carefully as the living. Between the two, a people learn to argue quietly and build loudly.

Collectives (clans, guild-kin, lamp-companies) own what the mountain allows; individuals are custodians by oath. Trade runs under and over the range through under-ways and pass-forts, stitching protectorates and lowland markets to vaultmouth gates. When tunnels whisper or the air tastes wrong, the Aeler move as one animal; when the Kingsmoot calls, crowns and abbesses argue in bell-code and sealed writs until the stone itself seems to lean in.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:aeler-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: \textbf{Spade} = place, \textbf{Heart} = actor, \textbf{Club} = pressure, \textbf{Diamond} = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Treat \textbf{Diamonds} as codified outcomes (keys/passes/rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any \textbf{A} appears, echo stone \& breath motifs---keys click, bells answer, and the mountain listens (and remembers).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Count the Air:} When a scene establishes scarce air, a character who actively paces their breathing (counted steps, measured rests) may shift \emph{Position} one step safer on their next physical action in a confined space.
\item \textbf{Bell-Code Courtesy:} If the party adopts local bell etiquette (asking a warden which chime applies and heeding it), gain +1 assist die on negotiations or passage requests within a vault or under-market.
\item \textbf{Measure is Mercy:} Presenting a certified measure (rod, weight, sealed tally) calms a dispute: cancel the first SB generated by commerce or jurisdictional friction in the scene.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Stone \& Sovereignty}]
In the deep places, survival depends on precision and tradition. The Aeler understand that stone does not forgive error---a misread seal can mean death, a miscalculated air measure can doom an expedition, and a broken bell-code can spark jurisdictional war. Their society is built on layers of authority, each with its own rites, rights, and responsibilities. To navigate their realm is to learn a complex dance of deference and demand, where even the humblest lamplighter holds power over the darkness, and the smallest key can unlock the greatest vault.

\section*{Thematic SB Spend Table}
\label{sec:thematic-sb}

\subsection*{Minor Complications (1 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Exposure:} Your actions draw unwanted attention from [local authority/creature/faction]
\item \textbf{Noise:} Sounds of your actions alert nearby [enemies/critters/locals]
\item \textbf{Trace:} Evidence of your passage marks your route for trackers/followers
\item \textbf{Delay:} A brief but meaningful setback costs you [time/resources/opportunity]
\item \textbf{Supply Strain:} Mark +1 segment on a relevant resource clock
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Moderate Setbacks (2 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Alarm Raised:} [Local authority/faction] becomes aware and begins responding
\item \textbf{Position Lost:} You lose advantageous ground/cover/stealth
\item \textbf{Foe Appears:} A [minor threat/rival/enemy] arrives on scene
\item \textbf{Gear Trouble:} A piece of equipment becomes [Compromised/Neglected]
\item \textbf{Lock/Barrier:} A simple obstacle now requires a test to overcome
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Serious Trouble (3 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reinforcements:} Additional [enemies/allies of enemies] arrive
\item \textbf{Key Gear Breaks:} A crucial tool/weapon becomes temporarily unusable
\item \textbf{Major Twist:} The situation fundamentally changes - [trap springs/route blocked/ally turns]
\item \textbf{Rail Tick:} Advance a relevant campaign/front clock by 1 segment
\item \textbf{Condition Applied:} Mark [Fatigue 1/Harm 1/Condition] appropriate to fiction
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Major Turns (4+ SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Trap Springs:} A prepared danger activates with full effect
\item \textbf{Authority Arrival:} [Major local power/leader/faction] intervenes
\item \textbf{Scene Shift:} The environment changes dramatically - [fire spreads/floor collapses/storm hits]
\item \textbf{Patron Omen:} Divine/arcane forces take notice - [omen appears/blessing lost/curse manifests]
\item \textbf{Narrative Pivot:} The story takes an unexpected turn that reframes objectives
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Region-Specific SB Options}
Each region generator should include 2-3 custom SB spends that reflect its unique themes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Aeler (Stone \& Breath):} Keys click in the wrong locks, bells answer without being rung, mountain air grows thin without warning
\item \textbf{Aeler (Authority \& Tradition):} A seal is misread, bell-codes conflict between jurisdictions, a vault warden demands proper credentials
\item \textbf{Aeler (Underground Hazards):} Bad air pockets form, settling cracks warn of collapse, gas flares ignite unexpectedly
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Aeler — Under‑Vault Tensions}
\textbf{Starting Location:} An Underway junction lit by guttering brass lanterns, its stone walls scored with tally‑marks from a dozen forgotten crowns.
\begin{quote}
“Among the Aeler, stone remembers the weight of oaths, and every echo calls a reckoning.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} An Underway junction, a Geometer halts the party with a tally-rod. ``The Spine shifts,'' he says, stone-dust in his beard. ``Choose a crown—or be buried by one.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Load-bearing oaths, fault-prayers, crown-rights, catacomb guilds.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Cut a supporting tie,'' ``Sign for another’s debt,'' ``Take a shortcut through the sealed tunnel.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``The Spine Slips''; Fracture: ``Maps Reorder''; Community: ``Surface Panic.''
\paragraph{Complications} Load-lights dim; echoes reply in politics; crown agents arrive early.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A PC’s workshop; a shared refuge tunnel.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The tally-rod points to the most guilty PC.
\paragraph{Relief} Shore a vault with sacrifice (1 anchor), or complete a truce between crowns; Spirit + Resolve (\DV{} 5) to hold a cave-in long enough to evacuate.

% ====== EXTENSIONS ======

\subsection*{Faction Entanglements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Edgewalkers (Prospectors):} If you accept their escort or intel, start a 4-segment \emph{Opportunity} clock you can cash for +1 Effect on one venture. If you refuse a posted hazard, they post \emph{your} route as “open” (first stealth or smuggling roll this leg suffers --1 die).
  \item \textbf{True Masons (Infrastructure Orders):} Pledge tools or labor to earn a \emph{Mason’s Stamp} (treat as papers to traverse construction zones). Cross a marked barrier without their leave and gain the \emph{Tampered Work} tag—first structural mishap SB against you is free.
  \item \textbf{Lamplighter Companies:} Donate wick, oil, or time on the Mile to bank a \emph{Lamp Credit}; spend to ignore darkness penalties once on the Under-Road. Skip a service bell and all under-market buys that scene cost +1 clock tick (queues \& suspicion).
  \item \textbf{Under-Market Assessors:} Submit to measure/weigh and reduce Commerce DV by 1 this scene. Try to pass unassayed goods—on a Miss, lose the load \emph{or} accept a \emph{Caveat Stamp} that poisons your price two markets downstream.
  \item \textbf{Breath Wardens:} Register bodies \& flames before sealed work; compliance cancels the first air-hazard SB. Skipping registry adds a \emph{Thin Air} tick to the leg (applies --1 die to the first exertion test in confinement).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cross-Regional Ties \& Soft Power}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Agrarian Reliance (Human Breadbelts):} Grain, timber, tallow, and fleece convoys from Acasia/Vhasia/Viterra sustain vault populations. Famine or levy spikes uprange impose night rationing: Under-Road checks +1 DV and food trades add +1 SB pressure until relief.
  \item \textbf{Standards Diplomacy:} Aeler \emph{Measure Vault} rods adopted abroad grant +1 die to settle disputes in foreign markets; rejecting Aeler standards increases toll and inspection frequency (first border scene gains a free “Lock/Barrier” SB).
  \item \textbf{True Mason Missions Abroad:} Accept a Mason cadre to “stabilize” bridges, ports, or sluices: reduce Travel DV by 1 on that route for the arc, but the route now respects Aeler closure bells (authorities can halt traffic with one writ).
  \item \textbf{Edgewalker Concessions:} Prospect notes traded to frontier lords exchange for wayleaves and salvage rights; cash once for an \emph{Under-Seal Clause (local)} or accept a rival claimant clock that will mature if you delay.
  \item \textbf{Kahfagian Interface (Sea Monopoly):} Aeler export hard-goods via Kahfagian factors; storm seasons or privateer scares add a \emph{Harbor Quarantine} tick to any surface leg feeding those ports (customs DV +1).
  \item \textbf{Aelerem/Aelinnel Fallout:} When \emph{Valewood Weather} is signaled, Aeler works creak; all bell-codes in mixed settlements (Aelerem/Aelinnel) are one step easier to misread (first bell-etiquette scene: add a free “Error/Security” SB unless you consult a local).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Trade Goods \& Consequences}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Airworks \& Wick (Oil, Char, Filters):} Donate to a vault—bank a \emph{Breath Favor} to cancel the next bad-air complication. Hoard in a shortage and your lot is flagged; all purchases beneath that crown suffer --1 die until you settle a fine or tithe.
  \item \textbf{Stonework \& Ironwork (Beams, Keys, Rods):} Selling to foreign keeps spreads Aeler codes: once per arc, treat a foreign gate as if it used Aeler warding (gain +1 die with Key-Sisters/warders there). Counterfeit measure rods trigger a cross-border inquest clock.
  \item \textbf{Foodflows (Grain, Fleece, Tallow):} Move relief trains to clear one \emph{Rationing} tag for a settlement (DV --1 for social checks there). Divert a relief train and gain an \emph{Audit} clock that follows you three markets hence.
  \item \textbf{Cistern-Right \& Water Engineering:} Fund a sluice or cistern abroad to gain \emph{Water Priority} (skip one queue during drought). Neglect maintenance and the keeper may invoke \emph{Aeler Liability}—pay or lose access to the route for a season.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Patron Networks (Below and Beyond)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Sealed Gate:} Consecrated door-nails from True Mason kits act as single-use \emph{stay} writs (negate one forced entry this scene).
  \item \textbf{The Traveler:} Spine milestones double as wayshrines; leave a brass chit to reroll one failed travel test on that segment this arc.
  \item \textbf{Inquisitor Prime:} Breath-pure censers sanction “clean rooms”; once per delve, dispel one ambient miasma or ward-rot effect at cost of +1 Obligation to local abbey-knights.
  \item \textbf{Maelstraeus:} Under-Market stalls tithe to the Great Ledger; cash a \emph{Market Dominance} tick to flip one price band in your favor for a scene, then mark a 4-segment \emph{Karmic Debt} with assessors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Survival-Horror Procedures (Use Often)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Headcount \& Flamecount:} At scene start in confinement, ask “Who breathes, what burns?” If headcount+flamecount exceeds posted limit, add a free “Thin Air” SB and start a 4-segment \emph{Stale Air} clock.
  \item \textbf{Two Bells to Safety:} Any time the fiction stalls underground, ring two nearby bells (authority vs. sanctum). PCs must pick one to heed; ignoring both increases the next hazard’s Cap by +1 (stone holds grudges).
  \item \textbf{Measure or Mistrust:} Producing a certified rod/weight cancels the first commerce/jurisdiction SB this scene; failing to present one imposes --1 die on haggling or passage until appeased.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Diplomatic Favor \& Reputation Echoes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Breath Favor (minor resource):} Earned by donating wick/oil or assisting air wardens. Spend to downgrade one underground hazard outcome or to bypass a lamplighter queue.
  \item \textbf{Stamps \& Seals:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \emph{Mason-Marked:} Doors to worksites open; smugglers avoid you (harder to buy contraband, easier to cross safely).
      \item \emph{Edge-Trusted:} Prospectors share fresh maps—first detour per leg is free; officials eye you as opportunists (first civic audience DV +1).
      \item \emph{Assessor-Clean:} Under-markets honor your assay; rivals spread rumors—add a trailing \emph{Audit} clock if you score a windfall.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
