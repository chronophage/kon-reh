\section{Silkstrand --- ``City of Bridges \& Dyewater'' Generator}
\label{chap:silkstrand}

\section*{Spades --- Places (bridges, canals, mills, counting floors)}
\label{sec:silkstrand-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Mulberry garths and wormhouses outside the North Gate---steam, sweet rot.
\item Filature hall (cocoon-boil) where whispers travel faster than steam.
\item Redwater Dyeworks along the stain-canal; brick stained forever.
\item Spindle Tower with creaking windlass-lifts and posted rates.
\item Three-Queens Bridge stacked with market stalls; cells under the arches.
\item Salt Gate customs quay---rope booms, chalk tallies, tired eyes.
\item Silk Exchange floor, chalk circles and clappers for opening bids.
\item Ropewalk sheds, arrow-straight; bruisers hired by the yard.
\item Old Imperial Arsenal, a Free Company's barracks now.
\item[J] The Archivolt---arcaded street of notaries, seals, and quiet knives.
\item[Q] Basilica of Saint Azerin (Weaver-saint); confraternity rooms hum with vows.
\item[K] Palazzo della Matrona (ruling seat) with a private river stairs.
\item[A] Flood-Stairs---bronze flood marks, bell rope ready when the Strand runs wild.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (guilds, factors, crowns, crews)}
\label{sec:silkstrand-people}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Bobbin-runner child---feet sure on parapets, rumors in pocket.
\item Mulberry steward counting leaves; desperate for pickers.
\item Foreign factor seeking a warehouse and a friend at customs.
\item Dyers' Guildmistress---hands stained, permits tighter than purse strings.
\item Bridge bailiff who rents stalls and sells gossip by the breath.
\item Archivolt notary; ``fixes'' missing recitals---for a donation.
\item Watch captain on condotta to three lords; passwords change with the wind.
\item Spinner-matron of the wormhouses; temper like hot copper.
\item Exchange caller whose clap can still a thousand voices.
\item[J] Night-boat smuggler ``Ravel,'' owner of a silent oar and louder favors.
\item[Q] The Matron of Silkstrand---patient, velvet, iron.
\item[K] The Lame King's envoy in velvet boots; claims certain alleys ``protected.''
\item[A] The Saint of Broken Warps (if real): sees curses braided in cloth.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (flood, interdict, riot, curse)}
\label{sec:silkstrand-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Flood siren; gates lowering---move your crates or kiss them goodbye.
\item Quarantine flag at Redwater; dyers' row sealed, your cargo implicated.
\item Loom strike over ``bad cocoons''; streets fill with idle frames.
\item Counterfeit seals discovered at the Archivolt; all contracts frozen.
\item Bridge riot---dropped stall blocks both lanes; tempers boil faster than vats.
\item Condottieri flip colors; watchwords change, escorts vanish.
\item Blackwood panic---witch-posts hammered on quay doors overnight.
\item Silk-fungus blight; wormhouses burn and refugees flood the piazze.
\item Salt-tax doubled at the Salt Gate; boats stack three deep.
\item[J] Duel booked on Three-Queens Bridge; you're named as seconds.
\item[Q] Exchange corner---rivals hoard raw thread; prices go vertical.
\item[K] Procession of Saint Azerin closes half the wards; ignore at peril.
\item[A] The Curse wakes in the canals: no route reaches the address you seek.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (permits, seats, escorts, charters)}
\label{sec:silkstrand-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Bridge token---one peak-hour cart crossing free.
\item Dye-permit chit; process a ``questionable'' color this week.
\item Warehouse seal from the Matron's office; rivals legally shut out.
\item Exchange floor pass (day) to trade without a sponsor.
\item Watergate priority---skip one flood closure when it matters.
\item Notarial indulgence---retrofit the missing recital; past deals stand.
\item Wormhouse allotment---claim a share of next hatch.
\item Ropewalk line of credit---hire crews before you have coin.
\item Arsenal armory key---one night's issue for your retinue.
\item[J] Condotta rider---city watch escorts you through any ward, once.
\item[Q] Private audience in the Palazzo; a whisper becomes policy.
\item[K] Tax-farm share on Three-Queens stalls for a season.
\item[A] The Matron's Golden Thread---temporary charter to set tolls on a named canal.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:silkstrand-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw 4 cards to seed: Spade=place, Heart=actor, Club=pressure, Diamond=leverage. Highest rank sets the main clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Treat Diamonds as codified outcomes (rights/papers/permits) that shift position rather than require tests.
\item If you want stronger ``Acasia-is-cursed'' vibes, any A also adds a lingering omen you can echo in later scenes.
\item If any A appears, echo silk \& water motifs---threads that bind, currents that remember, and bargains that stain the canal beds.
\end{itemize}
