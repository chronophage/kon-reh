\section{Silkstrand --- ``City of Bridges \& Dyewater'' Generator}
\label{chap:silkstrand}

Silkstrand is a city strung across canals and arches, a place where every bridge is a ledger line and every current carries rumor. The dyes that stain its waters never wash out, and neither do the bargains struck in shadow. Merchants rise and fall with the Exchange, bravos carve reputations on the planks of Three-Queens Bridge, and curses cling to the very cloth that leaves the looms. The Matron rules from her palazzo stairs with velvet and iron, but the city itself belongs to silk and tide.

\section*{Quick Use Notes}
\label{sec:silkstrand-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw 4 cards to seed: Spade=place, Heart=actor, Club=pressure, Diamond=leverage. Highest rank sets the main clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Treat Diamonds as codified outcomes (rights/papers/permits) that shift position rather than require tests.
\item If any A appears, echo silk \& water motifs---threads that bind, currents that remember, and bargains that stain the canal beds.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Duel Etiquette:} Duels fought on the bridges draw crowds as eager for wagers as for blood. Refusing a challenge stains a name worse than losing.
\item \textbf{Dyewater Omens:} The canals run strange colors at dawn; locals claim red foretells riots, blue brings calm, and black means curses awakened.
\item \textbf{The Matronâ€™s Seal:} Any contract bearing her seal is law in Silkstrand---but the Matron is known to rescind seals without warning, leaving debts and enemies tangled like frayed thread.
\end{itemize}
