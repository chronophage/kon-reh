\section{Silkstrand --- ``City of Bridges \& Dyewater''}
\label{chap:silkstrand}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Silkstrand is a city strung across canals and arches, a place where every bridge is a ledger line and every current carries rumor. The dyes that stain its waters never wash out, and neither do the bargains struck in shadow. Merchants rise and fall with the Exchange, bravos carve reputations on the planks of Three-Queens Bridge, and curses cling to the very cloth that leaves the looms. The Matron rules from her palazzo stairs with velvet and iron, but the city itself belongs to silk and tide.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:silkstrand-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (permits/seats/escorts) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{silk \& water} motifs---threads that bind, currents that remember, bargains that stain canal beds.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Duel Etiquette:} Duels fought on bridges draw crowds eager for wagers as blood. Refusing stains name worse than losing.
\item \textbf{Dyewater Omens:} Canals run strange colors at dawn; red foretells riots, blue brings calm, black means curses awakened.
\item \textbf{Matron's Seal:} Any contract bearing her seal is law---but Matron known to rescind seals without warning, leaving debts tangled.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Silkstrand, power flows through commerce, connections, and the careful weaving of influence. The Matron maintains control through a web of guilds, factors, and condottieri, each bound by contracts and customs that shift like the tides. Merchants rise and fall with the Exchange, while the city's bravos and smugglers operate in the spaces between law and profit.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Silkstrand revolves around access---to bridges, to warehouses, to the Exchange floor itself. Rewards often take the form of permits, seals, or safe passage that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (seals, tokens, contracts) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival guilds issue conflicting charters, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the bridges, markets, and Exchange as arenas for social contests, where reputation and connections determine success.
\end{itemize}
In Silkstrand, your word is your weave, and your weave determines whether you rise or drown.
