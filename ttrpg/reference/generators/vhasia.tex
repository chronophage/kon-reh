\chapter{Vhasia --- ``The Fractured Sun'' Generator}

\section*{Spades --- Places (châteaux, cathedrals, forests, fairs, roads)}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Wayside shrine where pilgrims tack petitions to a scorched sun-disc.
\item Vine-terraced clos above a millstream; watchmen nap in warm shade.
\item Bastide market square, neat as a canray board, gates shut at dusk.
\item Royal Forest ride---antler posts mark the king's old law.
\item Pont-du-Tithe: toll-bridge flanked by chapels and crossbows.
\item Great Fairground outside a chartered town; counting sheds ring like bells.
\item Salt pans and wind-pumps on the estuary; gulls own the law.
\item Siege-scarred château: hoardings up, cistern low, banners confused.
\item Cathedral works-yard; cranes creak, stones fly, faith is scaffolding.
\item[J] Parlement Hall hung with faded sunburst tapestries; clerks whisper.
\item[Q] Queen's Causeway across a river fen---cart wheels vanish in spring.
\item[K] The Sun Palace at Lence: shuttered mirrors, gardens gone to bramble.
\item[A] King's High Road, mile-stones chipped of crowns; armies love it anyway.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (lords, courts, companies, cloister)}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Road warden with a dented badge and an honest horn.
\item Vintner-guild syndic who counts saints' days as credit terms.
\item Abbess-chatelaine: runs a fortress-convent with iron accounts.
\item Routier (free-company) captain who prefers ransoms to pay.
\item Constable of a duchy, splendid kit, thin purse, thick pride.
\item Parlement clerk who can drown foes in procedure or fish them out.
\item Salt-farmer (gabelle lessee) with hired cudgels and a better map.
\item Trouvère with a scandalous lay about the last Sun-king.
\item Marshal in exile---the Sun-court's old hammer, now for hire.
\item[J] Heretic ``perfect'' preaching peace while hauling hidden daggers of fact.
\item[Q] Queen-Mother in a riverside keep; gives favors like dowries.
\item[K] The Two Crowns---rival dukes each ``crowned'' in different cathedrals.
\item[A] The Last Dauphin, a rumor with a birthmark; armies march for whispers.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (chevauchée, law, church, weather)}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Chevauchée: a fast raid puts the countryside to smoke; refugees flood roads.
\item Interdict falls on a county; bells are silent, tempers loud.
\item Forest law invoked---your venison becomes a hanging matter.
\item River in spate; the ferry master chains his boat and prays.
\item Coin debasement rumor; markets seize, soldiers demand silver.
\item Parlement stays proceedings; your siege must wait on parchment.
\item Free-company mutiny unless arrears are met---by you.
\item Relic dispute---two abbeys claim the same saint; mobs form.
\item Harvest blight; grain stores locked, bakers guarded by pikes.
\item[J] Tournament ``accident'' masks an assassination; you're named as witness.
\item[Q] Royalist restoration plot---sunburst badges appear on doorposts overnight.
\item[K] Feudal call-up: lords demand your troop levy with three days' bread.
\item[A] Winter campaign---roads to soup, hooves to ice, timetables to lies.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (charters, patents, safe-conducts, rights)}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Safe-conduct sealed by a duke or abbey; honored on one road, once.
\item Burgess charter for a market ward; walls and watch become your friends.
\item Bridge farm: take the tolls at Pont-du-Tithe for a season.
\item Paréage---shared rule charter with a monastery; split justice, keep rents.
\item Wardship over a minor heir; lands (and knights) obey you ``for now.''
\item Gabelle lease---salt-tax rights along the estuary; lucrative, hated.
\item Letters patent to raise a company under your banner.
\item Remission of feudal dues for a named village; they'll march when asked.
\item Low-justice grant (stocks, fines, gallows) in a troublesome hamlet.
\item[J] Confiscation writ against a royalist estate if you can seize it.
\item[Q] Private audience with the Queen-Mother; one secret exits as policy.
\item[K] Sunburst Warrant from the fallen court---most still obey it if shown boldly.
\item[A] General Pardon (temporary): absolves rebels who switch sides to yours.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw 4 to seed: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds = codified outcomes (rights/papers/charters) that shift position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo the broken-sun motif: a blotted medal, a sunburst scratched off a milestone, a loyalist hymn under someone's breath.
\end{itemize}
