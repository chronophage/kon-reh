\section{Vhasia --- ``The Fractured Sun'' Generator}
\label{chap:vhasia}

Vhasia is a realm of broken coronations and split loyalties. The once-unified \index{Sun-court} Sun-court shattered like its heraldic sunburst, leaving rival dukes, abbesses, and parlements to claim the light. Everywhere, signs of fracture: chipped sun-discs on milestones, worn tabards bearing half a crown, coins minted in rival cities with different suns. In Vhasia, \index{legitimacy} legitimacy is as fragile as a mirror, and every oath risks breaking along the fault lines of politics, faith, and fortune.

\subsection*{Spades --- Places (châteaux, cathedrals, forests, fairs, roads)}
\label{sec:vhasia-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Wayside shrine where pilgrims tack petitions to a scorched sun-disc; each parchment curls in different winds.
\item Vine-terraced clos above a millstream; watchmen nap, their halberds traded for bottles.
\item Bastide market square, neat as a canray board, where merchants pay homage to different “hours” of the Sun.
\item Royal Forest ride---antler posts mark laws no king remembers, yet poachers still hang.
\item Pont-du-Tithe: toll-bridge flanked by chapels and crossbows, its chains blessed by rival bishops.
\item Great Fairground outside a chartered town; counting sheds ring like bells, rumors louder still.
\item Salt pans and wind-pumps on the estuary; gulls own the law, and smugglers the night.
\item Siege-scarred château: hoardings patched, cistern low, banners cut into ragged suns.
\item Cathedral works-yard; cranes creak, stones fly, scaffolds bristle with rival stonemasons’ marks.
\item[J] Parlement Hall hung with faded tapestries, sunbursts spliced and re-stitched by claimants.
\item[Q] Queen’s Causeway across a river fen---a mile-long oath paved in quarried stone, half-sunk each spring.
\item[K] The Sun Palace at Lence: shuttered mirrors, brambled gardens, and courtiers playing at kingship.
\item[A] The King’s High Road, mile-stones chipped of crowns; yet every army still marches it.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (lords, courts, companies, cloister)}
\label{sec:vhasia-people}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Road warden with a dented badge and an honest horn, ignored by both crowns.
\item Vintner-guild syndic who counts saints’ days as credit terms and vintages as treaties.
\item Abbess-chatelaine: rules a fortress-convent with iron accounts and sharper scripture.
\item Routier captain, scarred and mercenary, who prefers ransoms to loyalty.
\item Constable of a duchy, splendid armor, empty coffers, and pride swollen as a banner.
\item Parlement clerk who drowns foes in procedure, or fishes them out in exchange for fealty.
\item Salt-farmer (gabelle lessee) with cudgels, writs, and a river-chart no crown has.
\item Trouvère whose scandalous lay about the last Sun-king brings knives to tavern doors.
\item Marshal in exile—the Sun-court’s hammer, now wielded by whoever pays in silver.
\item[J] Heretic “perfect” preaching peace while tucking hidden daggers into parchment margins.
\item[Q] Queen-Mother in a riverside keep; she weaves alliances as if they were dowries.
\item[K] The Two Crowns—rival dukes, each “crowned” in rival cathedrals, neither whole.
\item[A] The Last Dauphin, a rumor with a birthmark; armies march for whispers alone.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (chevauchée, law, church, weather)}
\label{sec:vhasia-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Chevauchée: raiders burn loyalty oaths as well as barns; smoke curls like scripture.
\item Interdict falls on a county; bells silenced, trade stalls, heretics prosper.
\item Forest law invoked—venison becomes treason, poachers hang on antler posts.
\item River in spate; ferries chained, bridges drowned, and pilgrims stranded mid-prayer.
\item Coin debasement—three mints, three suns, no trust; soldiers demand silver alone.
\item Parlement divided; siege laid on parchment before walls.
\item Free-company mutiny unless arrears are paid—in blood or coin.
\item Relic dispute—two abbeys claim the same saint’s bones; mobs answer with stones.
\item Harvest blight; bread locked behind pikes, bakers guarded as lords.
\item[J] Tournament “accident” hides assassination; your favor is now evidence.
\item[Q] Royalist restoration—sunburst badges painted overnight on doors and graves.
\item[K] Feudal levy called; lords demand levies in days, not months, with three days’ bread.
\item[A] Winter campaign—roads to mud, hooves to ice, armies to ruin.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (charters, patents, rights)}
\label{sec:vhasia-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Safe-conduct sealed by a duke or abbey; honored only once, on one road.
\item Burgess charter for a market ward; walls, watch, and revenue at your call.
\item Bridge farm: tolls at Pont-du-Tithe for a season, if you can hold it.
\item Paréage charter: shared rule with a monastery—half justice, half rent, no peace.
\item Wardship over a minor heir; lands obey you “for now.”
\item Gabelle lease—salt-tax rights; lucrative, hated, and dangerous.
\item Letters patent to raise a free-company under your banner.
\item Remission of feudal dues for a village; they’ll march when called.
\item Low-justice grant (stocks, fines, gallows) in a troublesome hamlet.
\item[J] Confiscation writ against a royalist estate—if you can seize it first.
\item[Q] Private audience with the Queen-Mother; her whisper becomes policy.
\item[K] Sunburst Warrant of the fallen court—most still bow if it’s shown boldly.
\item[A] General Pardon (temporary): rebels absolved if they bend the knee.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Quick Use Notes}
\label{sec:vhasia-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw 4 to seed: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds = codified outcomes (rights/papers/charters) that alter position without rolling.
\item If any Ace appears, echo the fractured sun motif—light that splinters, oaths that crack like glass.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\label{sec:vhasia-features}

\paragraph{Fractured Seals}
When you brandish a writ, badge, or charter tied to a claimant of the Sun-court, you may step \textbf{Position} up one step for the scene’s next interaction at a gate, court, or checkpoint. Each use advances a \textbf{Legitimacy (4)} clock linked to that claimant; when it fills, rivals challenge your authority on sight.

\paragraph{Parlement Games}
If a scene touches petitions, guild disputes, or feudal appeals, the first \textbf{Diamond} played becomes a \emph{policy lever}: treat it as two Diamonds toward swaying a decision or rewriting a local custom. Afterward, start or advance a \textbf{Whispered Precedent} clock; when it resolves, backlash spreads as other courts cite your case against you.

\paragraph{Gabelle Knife-Edge}
At bridges, fairs, and salt depots, you can convert \textbf{Diamonds} tied to tolls, leases, or safe-conducts into immediate passage or tariff relief for your company (no roll). Each conversion ticks a \textbf{Resentment (4)} clock for that locale; when it completes, expect boycotts, ambush rumors, or a sudden audit by rival officials.
