\section{Vhasia --- ``The Fractured Sun''}
\label{chap:vhasia}

\subsection*{Elite (Two Crowns)}
\textit{``The sun may be fractured, but our authority is absolute within our domains. Every coin minted here carries our blessing, and every law written bears our seal – the rest is just politics.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Road warden with dented badge and honest horn)}
\textit{``I've served under three different banners on this same stretch of road, and the only constant is that someone always wants to collect tolls. My horn calls honest warning – best heed it.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Vhasia is a realm of broken coronations and split loyalties. Once a proud province of the Utar empire, the unified \index{Sun-court} Sun-court shattered like its heraldic sunburst, leaving rival dukes, abbesses, and parlements to claim the light. Everywhere, signs of fracture: chipped sun-discs on milestones, worn tabards bearing half a crown, coins minted in rival cities with different suns. In Vhasia, \index{legitimacy} legitimacy is as fragile as a mirror, and every oath risks breaking along the fault lines of politics, faith, and fortune.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:vhasia-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (charters/patents/rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{fractured sun} motif—light that splinters, oaths that crack like glass.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fractured Seals:} When brandishing writ/badge/charter tied to Sun-court claimant, step \textbf{Position} up one step for scene's next interaction at gate/court/checkpoint. Each use advances \textbf{Legitimacy (4)} clock linked to claimant; when fills, rivals challenge authority on sight.
\item \textbf{Parlement Games:} If scene touches petitions/guild disputes/feudal appeals, first \textbf{Diamond} played becomes \emph{policy lever}: treat as two Diamonds toward swaying decision/rewriting custom. Afterward, start/advance \textbf{Whispered Precedent} clock; when resolves, backlash spreads as other courts cite case against you.
\item \textbf{Gabelle Knife-Edge:} At bridges/fairs/salt depots, convert \textbf{Diamonds} tied to tolls/leases/safe-conducts into immediate passage/tariff relief for company (no roll). Each conversion ticks \textbf{Resentment (4)} clock for locale; when completes, expect boycotts/ambush rumors/audit by rival officials.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Vhasia, power flows through the remnants of imperial authority, fractured legitimacy, and the careful manipulation of legal and religious institutions. Former Utar provincial structures still provide framework for governance, but competing claimants to the Sun-court have created a complex web of overlapping jurisdictions and conflicting loyalties. The true power lies with those who can navigate this legal maze and maintain the appearance of legitimate authority.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Vhasia revolves around legitimacy, legal documents, and the ability to command respect from institutions that no longer have a clear central authority. Rewards often take the form of charters, writs, and official positions that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (seals, badges, writs) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival claimants issue conflicting authorities, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the parlements, cathedrals, and châteaux as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of law and custom determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Vhasia, your papers are your power, and your power determines whether you rule or are ruled.

\item \textbf{Rail Tick:} Advance a relevant campaign/front clock by 1 segment.
\item \textbf{Condition Applied:} Mark \textbf{Fatigue 1/Harm 1/Condition} appropriate to fiction.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Vhasia (Legal Warfare):} Court decisions reverse without warning, precedents are cited against you, writs expire at crucial moments.
\item \textbf{Vhasia (Sun Symbolism):} Sun-discs crack underfoot, light splits into contradictory shadows, oaths shatter like glass.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Vhasia — Fractured Sun}
\textbf{Starting Location:} The Pont‑du‑Tithe, its golden arches catching fire in the sunset as pilgrims chant from both banks.
\begin{quote}
“In Vhasia, faith and empire march together—and both leave ash in their wake.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Pont-du-Tithe, a Duchy Constable offers letters patent. ``The Chevauchée burns,'' he says. ``And two Crowns march to meet it.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Processional bridges, crusade echoes, split sovereignty, tithe-law.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Take both patents,'' ``Confiscate a relic,'' ``Call a levy early.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Chevauchée''; Community: ``Tithe Unrest''; Anchor: ``Bridge Peace.''
\paragraph{Complications} Relics demand oaths; the bridge groans; pilgrims arm themselves.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A parish cook; a field hospital.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} Sunlight burns in the rain.
\paragraph{Relief} Unite the Crowns for one march; return relics to neutral ground; tithe from the GM’s favorite NPC purse.

\subsection*{Extended Features}
\label{sec:vhasia-extended}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Viterran Holdings:} Much like Plantagenet France, Viterra holds extensive lands, castles, and abbeys in northern Vhasia. These estates complicate every allegiance—dukes and abbesses may be Vhasian in name but Viterran in loyalty. Any Diamond tied to land or charter risks being overridden by Viterran claim.
\item \textbf{Faction Entanglements:} When traveling through Vhasia, allegiance matters. Declaring for a duke, abbey, or parlement modifies \emph{Position} one step in dealings with rivals. Silence may itself be treated as tacit support.
\item \textbf{Church Corruption:} Echoing a Three Musketeers era, bishops and abbesses play as much at politics as prayer. Relic disputes, indulgence sales, and cathedral building races create Complications that rival armies cannot ignore. Any Diamond tied to church authority is a double-edged blade.
\item \textbf{Trade Goods and Strains:} 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Vhasian wine is currency of diplomacy: spilled casks advance a \emph{Resentment} clock in rival duchies.
    \item Salt leases at Pont-du-Tithe ripple into Ubral and Kahfagia—granting passage but attracting bandits.
    \item Stamped coins circulate with rival suns; carrying mixed purses invites suspicion and bribe demands.
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Diplomatic Currency:} Introduce \emph{Favor of the Sun} as a minor track (like Boons). Earned by resolving conflicts between claimants without bloodshed, it can be spent to ease crossings or dismiss levies. Each use risks sparking a rival \emph{Legitimacy Challenge}.
\item \textbf{Reputation Echoes:} Gaining reputation with one claimant carries weight in others: rumors precede you across bridges, fairs, and shrines. This grants +1d to engagement rolls where prior deeds are known, but increases SB cost by +1 when foes exploit your divided loyalties.
\item \textbf{Processions and Parlements:} Add a special draw during travel: one extra card may be pulled to represent a festival, procession, or parlement session. This can invert Complications into Leverage (e.g., a Parlement Divided scene producing a sudden Diamond policy lever).
\item \textbf{Relic and Rite Pressure:} Any Diamond tied to relics, patents, or charters may be stolen, voided, or challenged in public. Such leverage always risks escalation—treat rival claims as a hidden SB cost the GM may reveal later.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cross-Regional Connections}
\label{sec:vhasia-cross}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{To Thepyrgos:} Synod indulgences can temporarily suspend Vhasian interdicts, but doing so creates precedent cited in Thepyrgos later (\emph{Whispered Precedent} clock).
\item \textbf{To Ubral:} Salt leases and bridge tolls turn into feud fuel; clans see them as foreign intrusion, advancing feud clocks when overused.
\item \textbf{To Kahfagia:} Wine routes and salt flows are lifeblood of coastal trade; a Kahfagian coracle-mark can substitute for Safe-Conduct once, but rivals may brand it smuggling.
\item \textbf{To Valewood:} Relics from Vhasia sometimes vanish into fae courts; a Diamond spent on relic control may instead draw fae interest.
\item \textbf{To Viterra:} Viterran dukes, abbots, and condottieri are ever-present; any travel seed through Vhasia may be claimed by Viterran authority. Safe-Conducts are fragile—Viterra treats them as favors, not guarantees.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{GM Guidance}
\label{sec:vhasia-gm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Treat Vhasia as a region of \emph{contested legitimacy}: every writ, token, or badge is both leverage and liability.
\item Complications should echo fracture: factions pulling players in opposite directions, symbols splitting under stress, oaths that cannot be held by all sides.
\item Rewards should feel conditional: charters, patents, and safe-conducts that are powerful but precarious, always subject to rival interpretation.
\item Intrigue should echo musketeer romances: duels in cathedrals, midnight meetings under abbey arches, letters seized at river fords. Every move risks scandal as much as war.
\end{itemize}
