\section{Vhasia --- ``The Fractured Sun''}
\label{chap:vhasia}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Vhasia is a realm of broken coronations and split loyalties. Once a proud province of the Utar empire, the unified \index{Sun-court} Sun-court shattered like its heraldic sunburst, leaving rival dukes, abbesses, and parlements to claim the light. Everywhere, signs of fracture: chipped sun-discs on milestones, worn tabards bearing half a crown, coins minted in rival cities with different suns. In Vhasia, \index{legitimacy} legitimacy is as fragile as a mirror, and every oath risks breaking along the fault lines of politics, faith, and fortune.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:vhasia-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (charters/patents/rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{fractured sun} motif—light that splinters, oaths that crack like glass.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fractured Seals:} When brandishing writ/badge/charter tied to Sun-court claimant, step \textbf{Position} up one step for scene's next interaction at gate/court/checkpoint. Each use advances \textbf{Legitimacy (4)} clock linked to claimant; when fills, rivals challenge authority on sight.
\item \textbf{Parlement Games:} If scene touches petitions/guild disputes/feudal appeals, first \textbf{Diamond} played becomes \emph{policy lever}: treat as two Diamonds toward swaying decision/rewriting custom. Afterward, start/advance \textbf{Whispered Precedent} clock; when resolves, backlash spreads as other courts cite case against you.
\item \textbf{Gabelle Knife-Edge:} At bridges/fairs/salt depots, convert \textbf{Diamonds} tied to tolls/leases/safe-conducts into immediate passage/tariff relief for company (no roll). Each conversion ticks \textbf{Resentment (4)} clock for locale; when completes, expect boycotts/ambush rumors/audit by rival officials.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Vhasia, power flows through the remnants of imperial authority, fractured legitimacy, and the careful manipulation of legal and religious institutions. Former Utar provincial structures still provide framework for governance, but competing claimants to the Sun-court have created a complex web of overlapping jurisdictions and conflicting loyalties. The true power lies with those who can navigate this legal maze and maintain the appearance of legitimate authority.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Vhasia revolves around legitimacy, legal documents, and the ability to command respect from institutions that no longer have a clear central authority. Rewards often take the form of charters, writs, and official positions that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (seals, badges, writs) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival claimants issue conflicting authorities, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the parlements, cathedrals, and châteaux as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of law and custom determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Vhasia, your papers are your power, and your power determines whether you rule or are ruled.
