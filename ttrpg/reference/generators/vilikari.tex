\section{Vilikari --- ``Laurels \& Longhouses'' Generator}
\label{chap:vilikari}

The Vilikari are the agrarian peoples straddling the frontiers of \index{Ecktoria} and \index{Kahfagia}, tillers and treaty-makers who balance survival between empire, steppe, and sea. In a three-way war with the \index{Ykrul} and the Black Banners, they live by the cleverness of their diplomacy, the leverage of their markets, and the shifting weight of oaths. Their halls are longhouses raised over ruined forums; their laws carved on both oak and marble; their loyalties braided like the braids of their war-maidens’ hair.

\subsection*{Spades --- Places (march towns, villa-forts, old roads)}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (two laws, two fronts, old grudges)}
\label{sec:vilikari-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Annona late---grain stipend misses the comitatus; tempers quicken.

\item[A] Great Law Day---proclaim a new concord; one temporary exception to old law stands.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\label{sec:vilikari-features}
\paragraph{Two-Law Balance}
Whenever a \emph{jurisdictional conflict} arises (mallus vs basilica, wolf vs eagle), players may step Position up by citing the \emph{Foedus Stone} or an older precedent—but every use adds a tick to the \textbf{Two-Law (4)} clock. When it fills, one side demands exclusive authority.

\paragraph{Frontier Diplomacy}
If a \emph{Heart} card involves a foreign envoy, federate, or mixed-blood courtier, treat the first \textbf{Diamond} played in the scene as doubled leverage. Once per session, a deal struck this way reverberates—advance or start a \textbf{Border Tension} front.

\paragraph{March Markets}
At any \emph{Staple Market, Ford, or Bridge}, Diamonds tied to rights or escorts may be cashed as currency in lieu of coin, one-for-one. Doing so creates a \textbf{Ledger Debt} that the GM may call in later through factions or raiders.

\subsection*{Quick Use Notes}
\label{sec:vilikari-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until all four suits appear: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (charters/rights/escorts) that shift position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any Ace appears, echo law \& bond motifs---oaths that bind, stones that witness, and treaties that remember every hand.
\end{itemize}
