\section*{Quick use notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until all four suits appear: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (charters/rights/escorts) that shift position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A shows, echo the two-laws motif---wolf and eagle side by side, or the Foedus Stone watching---across later scenes.
\end{itemize}
