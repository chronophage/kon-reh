\section{Vilikari --- ``Laurels \& Longhouses''}
\label{chap:vilikari}

\subsection*{Elite (Federate King)}
\textit{``We are the bridge between empire and wilderness, the marriage of law and custom. Our strength lies not in choosing one path but in walking both with equal surety.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Hearth-Mother who guest-cup and house's temper)}
\textit{``The old ways and new laws both have their place at our table. Serve the right mead to the right guest, honor the proper customs, and you'll find we're better hosts than most kings.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
The Vilikari are the agrarian peoples straddling the frontiers of \index{Ecktoria} and \index{Kahfagia}, tillers and treaty-makers who balance survival between empire, steppe, and sea. In a three-way war with the \index{Ykrul} and the Black Banners, they live by the cleverness of their diplomacy, the leverage of their markets, and the shifting weight of oaths. Their halls are longhouses raised over ruined forums; their laws carved on both oak and marble; their loyalties braided like the braids of their war-maidens' hair.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(March Town/Villa-Fort/Old Road)} Longhouse Quarter tucked into old forum with hearth-smoke under broken eaves; Milefort XVII with earth bank and faded eagle.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:vilikari-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (charters/rights/escorts) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{law \& bond} motifs---oaths that bind, stones that witness, treaties that remember every hand.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Two-Law Balance:} Whenever \emph{jurisdictional conflict} arises (mallus vs basilica, wolf vs eagle), players may step Position up by citing \emph{Foedus Stone} or older precedent—but every use adds tick to \textbf{Two-Law (4)} clock. When fills, one side demands exclusive authority.
\item \textbf{Frontier Diplomacy:} If \emph{Heart} card involves foreign envoy, federate, or mixed-blood courtier, treat first \textbf{Diamond} played in scene as doubled leverage. Once per session, deal struck reverberates—advance/start \textbf{Border Tension} front.
\item \textbf{March Markets:} At any \emph{Staple Market, Ford, or Bridge}, Diamonds tied to rights/escorts may be cashed as currency in lieu of coin, one-for-one. Doing so creates \textbf{Ledger Debt} GM may call in later through factions/raiders.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Vilikari society, power flows through the careful balance of multiple legal traditions, the management of frontier diplomacy, and the maintenance of complex oaths and treaties. The Federate King maintains authority through a combination of imperial forms and traditional customs, while local leaders wield influence through their knowledge of both Utaran law and tribal custom. The true power lies with those who can navigate this complex legal and diplomatic landscape while maintaining the loyalty of their people and the respect of their neighbors.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Vilikari society revolves around legal documents, diplomatic relationships, and the ability to command respect from institutions that operate under multiple legal systems. Rewards often take the form of treaties, charters, and official positions that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (seals, writs, treaties) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival legal systems issue conflicting authorities, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the courts, markets, and frontier posts as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of law and custom determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Vilikari society, your word is your bond, and your bond determines whether you rule or are ruled.

\item \textbf{Rail Tick:} Advance a relevant campaign/front clock by 1 segment.
\item \textbf{Condition Applied:} Mark \textbf{Fatigue 1/Harm 1/Condition} appropriate to fiction.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Narrative Pivot:} The story takes an unexpected turn that reframes objectives.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Region-Specific SB Options}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Vilikari (Two Laws):} Legal documents contradict each other, courts issue conflicting rulings, oaths bind to different authorities.
\item \textbf{Vilikari (Frontier Diplomacy):} Treaties expire without warning, foreign envoys demand additional concessions, mixed-blood courtiers shift allegiances.
\item \textbf{Vilikari (Border Tensions):} Frontier posts close without notice, markets shift locations, safe-conducts are revoked mid-journey.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Vilikari — Laurels and Longhouses}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A longhouse hung with laurel garlands and antler trophies, the air thick with mead and judgment.
\begin{quote}
“In Vilikari, feasts end in trials, and peace lasts only until the cups run dry.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Longhouse Quarter, a Ykrul Envoy lays a treaty scroll. ``The Foedus Stone cracks,'' he says. ``And the steppe listens.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Moot laurels, oath-stones, horse-lords, treaty feasts.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Break bread alone,'' ``Pocket the treaty seal,'' ``Name the steppe’s price.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Community: ``Feud Rekindled''; Threat: ``Envoy’s Trial''; Anchor: ``Foedus Stone.``
\paragraph{Complications} Longhouse smoke writes terms; horses refuse one PC; the seal sweats brine.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A host family; a hearth-blessing.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The Stone audibly cracks again.
\paragraph{Relief} Renew the feast with a difficult apology; ride a night circuit together; bind the seal with hair and oath.

\subsection*{Vilikari — Invisible in Plain Sight}
\paragraph{Seen/Unseen Clock (4)} When the company leans on Vilikari low profile—switching tongues, wearing the right braid, using local rites—reduce \textbf{Exposure} by 1 for a scene. Each time you do, tick \textbf{Seen/Unseen}. When it fills, one of these lands:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Face in the Crowd:} A local authority assumes you owe duties here; pay (coin, service, or favor) or mark \textbf{Position} down.
  \item \textbf{Forgotten Credit:} A past deed is attributed to someone “more official”; lose one stored leverage (GM picks) until publicly reclaimed.
  \item \textbf{Paper Mirror:} Your name appears under a different script; identity challenge triggers a \textbf{Law Tangle} at next gate/market.
\end{itemize}
Clear \textbf{Seen/Unseen} by: making a public claim (song, oath, banner) or accepting a small, sticky duty (night watch, tithe escort) for a locale.

\medskip

\paragraph{Treaty-Feast Procedure} To bind a deal over bread and smoke:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Set the Table:} Name 2–3 \emph{terms} (what both sides want) and 1 \emph{taboo} (off-limits).
  \item \textbf{First Cup (Position):} Roll/social test; success grants +1 die to bargain, failure grants the host 1 SB.
  \item \textbf{Bread & Salt (Offer):} Put \emph{one} leverage on the table (Diamond or oath-promise). Host matches with an obligation (escort, safe-market, or hostage).
  \item \textbf{Smoke (Test):} GM reveals a Complication tied to \emph{Old Grudges} or \emph{Two Laws}. Resolve or accept a \emph{Rider Clause}.
  \item \textbf{Knot the Braid:} On success, create a \textbf{Feast-Bond (3)} clock that protects both parties from betrayal in that matter while it has segments; on breach, the breaker immediately takes 1–2 SB and the clock flips to \textbf{Blood-Owed (3)}.
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Cross-Regional Conversions (Vilikari Interfaces)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Kahfagia (Lantern-Law):} \emph{Foedus Seal} may stand in for a \emph{Safe-Conduct} along a single beaconed lane once. Doing so ticks \textbf{Port Clash}.
\item \textbf{Ecktoria (Imperial Remnants):} \emph{Roman Patent} counts as \emph{Archive Hour} or \emph{Icon License} in old Utar sites—choose one per session.
\item \textbf{Vhasia (Fractured Sun):} \emph{Mallus Right} functions as \emph{Low-Justice} in a bastide for a day; first use starts a \textbf{Parlement Divided} tick.
\item \textbf{Viterra (Hedge-Law):} \emph{Wergild Table} can settle a \emph{Quiet Tolls} dispute without duel; convert 1 Club into \emph{Audit Freeze} unless a \emph{Parish Surveyor} is present.
\item \textbf{Ubral (Stone \& Oath):} \emph{Hostage Treaty} counts as \emph{Bride-Escrow} once; if cashed at a Moot, start \textbf{Feud Rekindled}.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Region-Specific SB Options (Vilikari Addenda)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Invisible Ledger:} A debt you paid “off-book” resurfaces; pay again or name the fixer (create a fragile ally).
\item \textbf{Twin Court Whiplash:} Basilican clerk and mallus elder arrive together; arguments must be made in \emph{both} forms or lose \textbf{Effect}.
\item \textbf{Forum Bones Stir:} Old mausolea “voice” an imperial claim; papers \& oaths suffer disadvantage until rites are observed.
\end{itemize}

% ================================

\subsection*{Geography \& Borders}
The Vilikari marches do \emph{not} touch Vhasia, Thepyrgos, Ubral, or the Valewood.  
They are land-bordering \textbf{Kahfagia} to the southwest, with the \textbf{Ecktoria} prefectures to the northwest, the \textbf{Aelerian Mountains} along the southern rim, and the \textbf{Direwood} pressing from the east.  
Beyond the northern steppe lie the Ykrul raiders and Linn clans.  

\emph{“The marches sit between the beaconed lanes of Kahfagia and the paper-forts of Ecktoria, with dwarf-kept passes in the Aelerian spurs and the Direwood’s breath forever clawing at their borders.”}

% -------------------------------
\section*{Cross-Regional Conversions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Kahfagia (Lantern-Law):} A \emph{Foedus Seal} may stand in for a \emph{Safe-Conduct} once on a beaconed lane. Doing so starts \emph{Port Clash [2]} in the next harbor touched.
  \item \textbf{Ecktoria (Imperial Remnants):} An \emph{Utaran Patent} counts as either \emph{Archive Hour} (scholars open doors) \emph{or} \emph{Icon License} (display symbols) in Ecktorial sites—choose once per session.
  \item \textbf{Aelerian Mountains (Pass \& Toll):} A \emph{Pass-Ring} grants priority at dwarf switchbacks. Cashing it to bypass inspection spawns \emph{Ledger Notice [3]}. A \emph{Guide’s Braid} improves Position on any high-pass travel.
  \item \textbf{Direwood (Breath \& Bells):} Spending \emph{Stipend Arrears} for levee labor converts one Direwood \textbf{Clubs} draw into a \emph{Ward-Salt} Diamond for a scene, then begins \emph{Names Disputed [3]} with bell-wardens.
\end{itemize}

% -------------------------------
\subsection*{Cross-Region Boss Entanglements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Kahfagian Lane War:} Outmaneuvering a \textbf{Port-Captain of Lantern-Law} by citing a \emph{Foedus Seal} converts one \emph{Port Clash} into \emph{Stall-Right} for a scene, then ticks \emph{Port Clash +1} later.
  \item \emph{Ecktoria’s Paper Teeth:} Defeating the \textbf{March Notary} with precedent spawns \emph{Whispered Precedent [4]} in New Raivon’s basilica benches.
  \item \emph{Aelerian Toll Storm:} Using a \textbf{Purple Warrant} to force dwarf passage downgrades one \emph{Bridge Levy} now, but adds \emph{Dwarf Toll Hike} at the next mountain seed.
  \item \emph{Direwood Breath-Debt:} Ransoming captives from a \textbf{Ykrul Storm-Rider} with a foster’s \emph{Name Facet} ticks \emph{Name Leverage [1]}, later claimable by Direwood spirits.
\end{itemize}

% -------------------------------
\subsection*{Region-Specific SB Options}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Beacon Audit (Kahfagia):} Lantern-law requires a bonded pilot; lose 1 Effect on smuggling or pay a fee (convert 1 Diamond into a temporary \emph{Pilot Bond}).
  \item \textbf{Prefect’s Recall (Ecktoria):} An Ecktorial clerk “recovers” a settler cohort; your next \emph{Hostage Treaty} is treated as \emph{Foedus Recall} unless countered by \emph{Mallus Right}.
  \item \textbf{Stone Tithe (Aelerian):} Dwarf wardens demand exact weights; failing to provide spawns \emph{Law Tangle} (weights vs. words).
  \item \textbf{Breath on the Wind (Direwood):} A ridge-signal carries a name you meant to keep hidden; mark \emph{Exposure +1} or pay \emph{Wergild Table} to buy silence.
\end{itemize}

% -------------------------------
\subsection*{Map Notes (GM Facing)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Southwest:} Kahfagia’s beaconed lanes and river-law bleed inland to staple markets.  
  \item \textbf{Northwest:} Ecktoria’s prefectures—paper strong, coffers weak—still field clerks and patents.  
  \item \textbf{South:} Aelerian spurs with dwarf switchbacks, toll-stones, and storms that own the high road.  
  \item \textbf{East:} The Direwood’s breath; names carry, bells toll, and salt buys only time.  
\end{itemize}
