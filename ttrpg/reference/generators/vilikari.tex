\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (two laws, two fronts, old grudges)}
\label{sec:vilikari-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Annona late---grain stipend misses the comitatus; tempers quicken.
\item Jurisdiction tangle: mallus verdict vs basilica writ---whose seal bites?
\item Winter raid rumor from a Ykrul boyar; levies panic the plowlands.
\item Bridge levy doubled for road-works; caravans balk, fists rise.
\item Succession feud---wolf-brother claim vs purple-charter heir.

\item Coin debasement talk; pay demanded in salt, hides, hostages.
\item Grave offense---burial field disturbed; omens ride with the news.
\item Port clash: lantern-law vs street-law; confiscations bloom.
\item[J] Warband flips colors mid-pay; hostage protocol snaps shut.
\item[Q] Restoration preacher stirs crowds against the ``barb king in purple.''
\item[K] General levy---march closed; markets freeze into spears.

\setcounter{enumi}{1}

\item Wergild Table recognized by both codes; vengeance priced and paid.
\item Bridge Farm (imperial) for a season---funds and friends accrue.
\item[J] Purple-Border Warrant---wear the stripe; officials defer on sight.
\item[Q] Private Audience with the Queen of the Marches; whisper becomes policy.
\item[K] Dux Commission---command a mixed unit with pay authority.
\item[A] Great Law Day---proclaim a new concord; one temporary exception to old law stands.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:vilikari-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until all four suits appear: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (charters/rights/escorts) that shift position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A shows, echo the two-laws motif---wolf and eagle side by side, or the Foedus Stone watching---across later scenes.
\item If any A appears, echo law \& bond motifs---oaths that bind, stones that witness, and treaties that remember every hand.
\end{itemize}
