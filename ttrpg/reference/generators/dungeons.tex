\section*{Spades --- Places (Chambers, Features, Architecture)}
\label{sec:dungeon-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item \textbf{Cracked Gallery} — Hairline faults veined with damp; grit ticks from the ceiling like a slow clock.
\item \textbf{Sunken Vestibule} — Waist-deep water glazed with oil rainbows; cold leeches the knees, something brushes past.
\item \textbf{Vaulted Refectory} — Tables laid for a meal gone to dust; goblets taste faintly of iron when breathed upon.
\item \textbf{Spiral Stairwell} — Steps cupped by centuries; one cough ricochets down into a throat not your own.
\item \textbf{Collapsed Observatory} — Stars stare through ribs of broken dome; wind brings ash that smears like soot.
\item \textbf{Armory Alcove} — Weapon shadows longer than the racks; a glass-front case fogs from the inside.
\item \textbf{Chained Sanctuary} — Prayer-niches and iron hooks; stone bruised where something strained to leave.
\item \textbf{Mirror Hall} — Reflections lag by a heartbeat; one pane shows you older, another shows you missing.
\item \textbf{Garden of Stone} — Statues mid-breath; a chisel-mark still weeps dust as if freshly struck.
\item[J] \textbf{Throne of Echoes} — A single block worn satin-smooth; sit and your name returns in a stranger’s verdict.
\item[Q] \textbf{Vault of Whispers} — Books exhale when opened; vowels crawl up the spine and into the ear.
\item[K] \textbf{Chamber of Seasons} — Air flips from pollen-sweet to knife-cold; breath ghosts, sweat beads, leaves skitter.
\item[A] \textbf{The Heart Chamber} — Mortar smells like blood, light like fever; floor hums to your pulse then sets its own.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hearts --- Actors (Inhabitants, Factions, Entities)}
\label{sec:dungeon-actors}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item \textbf{Forgotten Custodian} — Keys like teeth on a ring; polishes thresholds no one crosses.
\item \textbf{Scholar-Prisoner} — Ink-stained nails, hollow cheeks; knows which lies the walls prefer.
\item \textbf{Symbiotic Colony} — Many mouths, one hunger; bargains in warmth, hoards salt.
\item \textbf{Cursed Noble} — Velvet rotted to lace; voice drags like chain, eyes beg for ending.
\item \textbf{Mercenary Remnant} — Dried mud, wet fear; map carved into forearm with a dinner knife.
\item \textbf{Bound Guardian} — Filigree of wards across stone skin; obeys the letter, hears the spirit.
\item \textbf{Cult Initiate} — Pupil-widened zeal; speaks passwords like prayers, prayers like debts.
\item \textbf{Refugee Family} — Boot-scrapes under cots; clutch charms that grow warm when danger nears.
\item \textbf{Merchant of Curiosities} — Breath like cloves and rust; sells certainty bottled and slightly used.
\item[J] \textbf{Ascended Vermin} — Crown of wire, court of nests; taxes crumbs, enforces with a thousand eyes.
\item[Q] \textbf{Fallen Hero’s Shade} — Armor of frost, sword of grievance; wants one last right choice.
\item[K] \textbf{Dungeon’s Creator} — Architect’s hands cracked with mortar; still moving rooms the way others move chess.
\item[A] \textbf{The Collective Consciousness} — Voices braided into one intention; your thoughts return carrying fingerprints.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Pressures (Hazards, Threats, Complications)}
\label{sec:dungeon-pressures}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item \textbf{Shifting Walls} — Mortar pops like knuckles; corridors narrow behind you with polite insistence.
\item \textbf{Hungering Dark} — Wicks gutter blue; shadows lip the flame and swallow the heat first.
\item \textbf{Memory Fog} — Cool on the gums, sweet on the tongue; you “recall” a door that never was.
\item \textbf{Gravity Wells} — Knees turn to iron; dropped coins smack floor like thrown knives.
\item \textbf{Temporal Echoes} — Footfalls not yours keep pace; a conversation repeats with one word wrong.
\item \textbf{Corrosive Atmosphere} — Leather slimes, metal freckles; breathe shallow or taste copper.
\item \textbf{Phantom Locks} — Doors exist when watched sidelong; they prefer particular hands and hours.
\item \textbf{Borrowed Time} — Hair whitens at the tips; hunger leaps ahead of the clock.
\item \textbf{Infectious Transformation} — Fingertips grain to stone, pupils catch light like a cat’s; urges shift.
\item[J] \textbf{Reality Anchor Points} — Candles burn sideways, water beads uphill; spells itch in the teeth.
\item[Q] \textbf{The Dungeon’s Will} — Maps argue with themselves; paths rephrase your intentions.
\item[K] \textbf{Cascading Failure} — A cracked lintel sighs and the far cistern answers; systems talk in groans.
\item[A] \textbf{The Price of Passage} — Each shortcut salts your tongue with loss; the house keeps its ledger.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Diamonds --- Leverages (Rewards, Tools, Advantages)}
\label{sec:dungeon-leverages}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item \textbf{Wayfinder Compass} — Needle twitches toward safety like a frightened animal; steadies if you hum.
\item \textbf{Key of Echoes} — Warms in the palm when a door remembers being opened.
\item \textbf{Lantern of Clarity} — Light outlines hollows in the world; truths show up as clean edges.
\item \textbf{Cloak of Passage} — Hem sips through stone or mist; leaves damp prints on the far side.
\item \textbf{Tome of Convenient Knowledge} — Pages grow new margins; ink creeps to answer the question you’re afraid to ask.
\item \textbf{Ration of Sustenance} — Bread that tastes like last winter; settles the stomach, quiets the shakes.
\item \textbf{Focus Crystal} — Thrum matches your breath; thoughts align the way teeth fit.
\item \textbf{Token of Safe Return} — Thread around a wrist; tugs once when it’s time to flee.
\item \textbf{Map that Grows} — Charcoal blooms corridors as you walk; tiny figures drift where things currently are.
\item[J] \textbf{Shield of Temporary Immunity} — Hazards strike sparks and spend themselves like rain on slate.
\item[Q] \textbf{Crown of Momentary Authority} — Creatures blink, recognize a crest they cannot name, and obey.
\item[K] \textbf{Forge of Quick Repair} — Heat like a heartbeat; fractured gear exhales and remembers its shape.
\item[A] \textbf{The Dungeon’s Blessing} — A knack that lingers in the bones; doors like you now, as do certain hungers.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:dungeon-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Seed with four cards: \textbf{Spade}=place, \textbf{Heart}=actor, \textbf{Club}=pressure, \textbf{Diamond}=leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Diamonds are \emph{position changers}: play for keys, truths, routes, and brief immunities—no test.
\item If any \textbf{A} appears, give the site a pulse: the place notices you and answers later (a door relocated, a voice repeats your plan, the light returns redder).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Living Infrastructure}: Fluids, heat, dust, and sound move like blood—follow the drafts, the drips, the echoes to find organs: cisterns, chimneys, nerve-halls.
\item \textbf{Scent Ledger}: Track smells (ozone, wet lime, tallow, old wine); they foretell hazards and factions before you see them.
\item \textbf{Echo Etiquette}: Some rooms reward whispers and punish shouts; others demand a spoken price to cross. Listen first.
\end{itemize}
