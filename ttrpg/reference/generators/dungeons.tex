\section{Dungeon --- ``Living Infrastructure''}
\label{chap:dungeon-generator}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Beneath the surface, ancient places breathe with mechanical lungs and dream electric dreams. Dungeons are not merely ruins but living systems—vascular networks of stone and shadow where every corridor hums with purpose and every chamber holds its own hungry logic. The walls remember every footfall, the air carries whispers of forgotten conversations, and the very architecture shifts like a sleeper turning in bed. Here, the boundary between structure and organism blurs, and those who would plunder its secrets must first learn to speak its language of echoes, scents, and subtle pressures.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Chamber/Feature)} Cracked gallery veined with damp; grit ticks from the ceiling like a slow clock.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:dungeon-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (papers/claims/safe-conducts) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{living infrastructure}---walls shift, voices repeat your plans, light returns redder.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Living Infrastructure:} Fluids, heat, dust, and sound move like blood---follow the drafts, the drips, the echoes to find organs: cisterns, chimneys, nerve-halls.
\item \textbf{Scent Ledger:} Track smells (ozone, wet lime, tallow, old wine); they foretell hazards and factions before you see them.
\item \textbf{Echo Etiquette:} Some rooms reward whispers and punish shouts; others demand a spoken price to cross. Listen first.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
The true dungeon is not a place but a process---a slow alchemy that transforms intruders into something the structure can understand or consume. Every chamber is a test, every corridor a negotiation, and every inhabitant a symptom of the site's deeper hungers. The wise explorer learns to read the dungeon's moods in the way light falls, the way echoes return, and the way the very air seems to lean toward certain passages. Here, knowledge is not power but currency, and the smart adventurer knows when to pay with memory, when to pay with blood, and when to simply walk away.

\section*{Thematic SB Spend Table}
\label{sec:dungeon-sb}

\subsection*{Minor Complications (1 SB)}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Moderate Setbacks (2 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Alarm Raised:} \textbf{The dungeon's will} becomes aware and begins responding.

\item \textbf{Gear Trouble:} A piece of equipment becomes \textbf{Compromised/Neglected}.
\item \textbf{Lock/Barrier:} A simple obstacle now requires a test to overcome.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Rail Tick:} Advance a relevant campaign/front clock by 1 segment.
\item \textbf{Condition Applied:} Mark \textbf{Fatigue 1/Harm 1/Condition} appropriate to fiction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Major Turns (4+ SB)}

\item \textbf{Narrative Pivot:} The story takes an unexpected turn that reframes objectives.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Region-Specific SB Options}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dungeon (Living Infrastructure):} Corridors whisper your name, reflections blink slower, scent trails loop back.
\item \textbf{Dungeon (Echo Etiquette):} Shouts echo thrice, silence answers back, doors ask riddles.
\item \textbf{Dungeon (Cascading Failure):} One crack becomes many, water flows uphill, lights dim in sequence.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Dungeon — Living Infrastructure}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A spiral stairwell deep beneath a forgotten citadel, pulsing with a heartbeat not entirely mechanical.
\begin{quote}
“In the Dungeon, walls breathe, corridors shift, and memory is the only map worth keeping.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A spiral stairwell, the steps hum underfoot. A Forgotten Custodian keys a door that wasn’t there yesterday. ``The Heart Chamber hungers,'' they whisper. ``Will you feed it—or be fed?''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Maintenance spirits, adaptive stone, ritual vents, memory valves.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Take the shortcut that erases you,'' ``Trade blood for passage,'' ``Leave a companion behind as toll.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Heart Pressure Rises''; Fracture: ``Floorplan Loops''; Anchor: ``Safe Route Fails.''
\paragraph{Complications} Corridors swap; keys rust to teeth; the Custodian forgets who asked.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} Camp cache; a mapping apprentice.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The stairwell adds a step every circuit.
\paragraph{Relief} Vent the Heart with a true name; feed it a secret belonging to all PCs (reduces Threat by one).
% ====== DUNGEON: PLUG-AND-PLAY EXTENSIONS ======

\subsection*{Plug-in Expedition Layer}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Universal Clocks (drop into any site):}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \emph{Dungeon Awareness (Heat)} [10]: rises on loud actions, light spillage, blood, or haste. At 4/7/10, the Keeper may promote Clubs results one step.
      \item \emph{Structure Stress} [6/8]: ticks on blasts, overloading mechanisms, or ignored warnings; when full, trigger \emph{Cascading Failure}.
      \item \emph{Expedition Supply}: three pooled tracks—\emph{Light} [4], \emph{Air} [4] (if sealed), \emph{Load} [4] (fatigue/overburden). Each empty track worsens Position for relevant actions until refreshed.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Safe Route Tokens:} On a strong success mapping/scouting, issue a \emph{Safe Route} token. Spend to bypass one known hazard in that segment or to negate a single “Position Lost” SB.
  \item \textbf{Retreat \& Seal:} When withdrawing, a PC may \emph{seal the way} (chalk, wedges, wards). Clear 1 Heat, but tick \emph{Structure Stress} or spawn a \emph{Phantom Lock} in that lane.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Interfaces \& Entanglements (use what fits your campaign)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Surface Stakeholders:} \emph{Scavenger Union}, \emph{Shrinekeepers}, \emph{Civic Factors}. Register finds to bank a \emph{Finder’s Favor}—spend to reduce one sell-off DV; skipping registration adds a “Disputed Claim” tag to the haul.
  \item \textbf{Internal Polities:} \emph{Custodians}, \emph{Bound Guardians}, \emph{Refugee Enclaves}. Parley with proper tokens (salt, names, warmth) to downgrade the next Clubs result in their turf.
  \item \textbf{Patron Hooks (optional):}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{The Sealed Gate:} Chalk lines cancel one intrusion for a scene; breaking them adds 1 Heat.
      \item \textbf{Lunara:} Moon-silver reveals one hidden organ (cistern, nerve-hall); mark Exposure +1.
      \item \textbf{The Traveler:} Waymarks let you finish one travel tick after a room clear.
      \item \textbf{Varnek Karn:} Naming the dead here clears 1 \emph{Awareness} but starts a \emph{Ledger Attention} [4].
      \item \textbf{Maelstraeus:} Trade salvage tags at “fair rate” once/expedition; skewed trades create a \emph{Karmic Debt} [6].
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Keys, Locks, \& Doors (drop-in schema)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Door Attitudes:} \emph{Literal} (wants the right key), \emph{Courteous} (opens to the right words), \emph{Hungry} (takes a toll), \emph{Shy} (hates crowds), \emph{Proud} (demands ceremony).
  \item \textbf{Key Types:} \emph{Mechanical} (wards/picks), \emph{Mnemonic} (password, name), \emph{Somatic} (gesture, breath), \emph{Affective} (emotion offered), \emph{Sacrificial} (blood, time, memory).
  \item \textbf{Rule of Two:} Each important barrier recognizes two different key types; learning either grants +1 Effect to breach or parley with it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Salvage, Haul, \& Conversion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Salvage Tags:} \emph{Stable} (safe to carry), \emph{Volatile} (ticks Stress on jostle), \emph{Bound} (linked to site), \emph{Loud} (adds Heat when moved), \emph{Forbidden} (attracts factions).
  \item \textbf{Convert on Exit (choose one):} trade haul for a \emph{Map that Grows} upgrade, a \emph{Pass-Key Writ} (one automatic door compliance), or \emph{Market Credit} (reduce next sell-off complication).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Table Prompts (d6 each, fast prep)}
\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
\textbf{Echo Questions}
\begin{enumerate}\item What does the room want?\item Who set this alarm?\item What was repaired last?\item Where does the draft go?\item What memory sticks here?\item What price opens the way?\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
\textbf{Find the Organ}
\begin{enumerate}\item Cistern (fluid)\item Bell-shaft (signal)\item Heat lung (thermal)\item Nerve-hall (control)\item Waste sluice (decay)\item Relay shrine (intent)\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}

\subsection*{Procedures at the Door (one-minute read-aloud checklist)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Sense:} Name two smells; ask which grew stronger.
  \item \textbf{Listen:} Offer one echo; ask what word returns wrong.
  \item \textbf{Light:} Describe color/behavior; ask who steadies it (hum, prayer, silence).
  \item \textbf{Count:} Beats, drips, or breaths—players may claim \emph{Counting Etiquette} to shift Position safer once.
  \item \textbf{Declare Price or Key:} Players state attitude + key type; on a hit, grant +1 Effect or a \emph{Safe Route} token.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Plug-in SB Conversions (use with any dungeon)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item First 1 SB in a scene may become \emph{Heat +1} instead of a narrative wrinkle (signal without immediate harm).
  \item Any 2 SB can instead tick \emph{Structure Stress} and foreshadow \emph{Cascading Failure} rather than spawn foes.
  \item On 3+ SB, offer a bargain: pay with \emph{memory/gear/time} to halve the consequence and add \emph{Price of Passage} [3].
\end{itemize}
