\section{Dungeon --- ``Living Infrastructure''}
\label{chap:dungeon-generator}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Beneath the surface, ancient places breathe with mechanical lungs and dream electric dreams. Dungeons are not merely ruins but living systems—vascular networks of stone and shadow where every corridor hums with purpose and every chamber holds its own hungry logic. The walls remember every footfall, the air carries whispers of forgotten conversations, and the very architecture shifts like a sleeper turning in bed. Here, the boundary between structure and organism blurs, and those who would plunder its secrets must first learn to speak its language of echoes, scents, and subtle pressures.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Chamber/Feature)} Cracked gallery veined with damp; grit ticks from the ceiling like a slow clock.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:dungeon-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (papers/claims/safe-conducts) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{living infrastructure}---walls shift, voices repeat your plans, light returns redder.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Living Infrastructure:} Fluids, heat, dust, and sound move like blood---follow the drafts, the drips, the echoes to find organs: cisterns, chimneys, nerve-halls.
\item \textbf{Scent Ledger:} Track smells (ozone, wet lime, tallow, old wine); they foretell hazards and factions before you see them.
\item \textbf{Echo Etiquette:} Some rooms reward whispers and punish shouts; others demand a spoken price to cross. Listen first.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
The true dungeon is not a place but a process---a slow alchemy that transforms intruders into something the structure can understand or consume. Every chamber is a test, every corridor a negotiation, and every inhabitant a symptom of the site's deeper hungers. The wise explorer learns to read the dungeon's moods in the way light falls, the way echoes return, and the way the very air seems to lean toward certain passages. Here, knowledge is not power but currency, and the smart adventurer knows when to pay with memory, when to pay with blood, and when to simply walk away.

\subsection*{Dungeon — Living Infrastructure}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A spiral stairwell deep beneath a forgotten citadel, pulsing with a heartbeat not entirely mechanical.
\begin{quote}
“In the Dungeon, walls breathe, corridors shift, and memory is the only map worth keeping.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A spiral stairwell, the steps hum underfoot. A Forgotten Custodian keys a door that wasn’t there yesterday. ``The Heart Chamber hungers,'' they whisper. ``Will you feed it—or be fed?''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Maintenance spirits, adaptive stone, ritual vents, memory valves.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Take the shortcut that erases you,'' ``Trade blood for passage,'' ``Leave a companion behind as toll.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Heart Pressure Rises''; Fracture: ``Floorplan Loops''; Anchor: ``Safe Route Fails.''
\paragraph{Complications} Corridors swap; keys rust to teeth; the Custodian forgets who asked.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} Camp cache; a mapping apprentice.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The stairwell adds a step every circuit.
\paragraph{Relief} Vent the Heart with a true name; feed it a secret belonging to all PCs (reduces Threat by one).
