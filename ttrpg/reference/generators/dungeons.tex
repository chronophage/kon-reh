\section{Dungeon --- ``Living Infrastructure''}
\label{chap:dungeon-generator}

\subsection*{Elite (Dungeon's Creator)}
\textit{``I built more than walls and corridors – I crafted a living symphony of stone and shadow, where every passage breathes and every chamber remembers. The structure itself is the true inhabitant.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Scholar-Prisoner)}
\textit{``The walls here got a memory like old parchment – they remember every scream, every spell, every drop of blood spilled on the stones. And sometimes, when the air's just right, they whisper it back to you.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Beneath the surface, ancient places breathe with mechanical lungs and dream electric dreams. Dungeons are not merely ruins but living systems—vascular networks of stone and shadow where every corridor hums with purpose and every chamber holds its own hungry logic. The walls remember every footfall, the air carries whispers of forgotten conversations, and the very architecture shifts like a sleeper turning in bed. Here, the boundary between structure and organism blurs, and those who would plunder its secrets must first learn to speak its language of echoes, scents, and subtle pressures.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Chamber/Feature)} Cracked gallery veined with damp; grit ticks from the ceiling like a slow clock.

\section*{Spades --- Places (categories)}
\label{sec:dungeon-places}

\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item \textbf{Cracked Gallery} --- Hairline faults veined with damp; grit ticks from the ceiling like a slow clock.
\item \textbf{Sunken Vestibule} --- Waist-deep water glazed with oil rainbows; cold leeches the knees, something brushes past.
\item \textbf{Vaulted Refectory} --- Tables laid for a meal gone to dust; goblets taste faintly of iron when breathed upon.
\item \textbf{Spiral Stairwell} --- Steps cupped by centuries; one cough ricochets down into a throat not your own.
\item \textbf{Collapsed Observatory} --- Stars stare through ribs of broken dome; wind brings ash that smears like soot.

\item \textbf{Refugee Family} --- Boot-scrapes under cots; clutch charms that grow warm when danger nears.

\item[K] \textbf{Dungeon's Creator} --- Architect's hands cracked with mortar; still moving rooms the way others move chess.

\item[K] \textbf{Cascading Failure} --- A cracked lintel sighs and the far cistern answers; systems talk in groans.
\item[A] \textbf{The Price of Passage} --- Each shortcut salts your tongue with loss; the house keeps its ledger.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{(Tool/Reward)} Wayfinder compass needle twitches toward safety like a frightened animal; steadies if you hum.

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (categories)}

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:dungeon-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (papers/claims/safe-conducts) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{living infrastructure}---walls shift, voices repeat your plans, light returns redder.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Living Infrastructure:} Fluids, heat, dust, and sound move like blood---follow the drafts, the drips, the echoes to find organs: cisterns, chimneys, nerve-halls.
\item \textbf{Scent Ledger:} Track smells (ozone, wet lime, tallow, old wine); they foretell hazards and factions before you see them.
\item \textbf{Echo Etiquette:} Some rooms reward whispers and punish shouts; others demand a spoken price to cross. Listen first.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
The true dungeon is not a place but a process---a slow alchemy that transforms intruders into something the structure can understand or consume. Every chamber is a test, every corridor a negotiation, and every inhabitant a symptom of the site's deeper hungers. The wise explorer learns to read the dungeon's moods in the way light falls, the way echoes return, and the way the very air seems to lean toward certain passages. Here, knowledge is not power but currency, and the smart adventurer knows when to pay with memory, when to pay with blood, and when to simply walk away.

\section*{Thematic SB Spend Table}
\label{sec:dungeon-sb}

\subsection*{Minor Complications (1 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Exposure:} Your actions draw unwanted attention from \textbf{dungeon dwellers or factions}.
\item \textbf{Noise:} Sounds of your actions alert nearby \textbf{creatures or echoes}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Moderate Setbacks (2 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Alarm Raised:} \textbf{The dungeon's will} becomes aware and begins responding.
\item \textbf{Position Lost:} You lose advantageous ground/cover/stealth due to \textbf{shifting architecture}.
\item \textbf{Foe Appears:} A \textbf{minor entity or faction member} arrives on scene.
\item \textbf{Gear Trouble:} A piece of equipment becomes \textbf{Compromised/Neglected}.
\item \textbf{Lock/Barrier:} A simple obstacle now requires a test to overcome.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Serious Trouble (3 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reinforcements:} Additional \textbf{dungeon entities or guardians} arrive.
\item \textbf{Key Gear Breaks:} A crucial tool/weapon becomes temporarily unusable.
\item \textbf{Major Twist:} The situation fundamentally changes - \textbf{trap springs/route blocked/ally turns}.
\item \textbf{Rail Tick:} Advance a relevant campaign/front clock by 1 segment.
\item \textbf{Condition Applied:} Mark \textbf{Fatigue 1/Harm 1/Condition} appropriate to fiction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Major Turns (4+ SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Trap Springs:} A prepared danger activates with full effect.
\item \textbf{Authority Arrival:} \textbf{The Dungeon's Creator or Collective Consciousness} intervenes.
\item \textbf{Scene Shift:} The environment changes dramatically - \textbf{walls shift/floor collapses/air thickens}.
\item \textbf{Patron Omen:} Divine/arcane forces take notice - \textbf{omen appears/blessing lost/curse manifests}.
\item \textbf{Narrative Pivot:} The story takes an unexpected turn that reframes objectives.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Region-Specific SB Options}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dungeon (Living Infrastructure):} Corridors whisper your name, reflections blink slower, scent trails loop back.
\item \textbf{Dungeon (Echo Etiquette):} Shouts echo thrice, silence answers back, doors ask riddles.
\item \textbf{Dungeon (Cascading Failure):} One crack becomes many, water flows uphill, lights dim in sequence.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Dungeon — Living Infrastructure}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A spiral stairwell deep beneath a forgotten citadel, pulsing with a heartbeat not entirely mechanical.
\begin{quote}
“In the Dungeon, walls breathe, corridors shift, and memory is the only map worth keeping.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A spiral stairwell, the steps hum underfoot. A Forgotten Custodian keys a door that wasn’t there yesterday. ``The Heart Chamber hungers,'' they whisper. ``Will you feed it—or be fed?''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Maintenance spirits, adaptive stone, ritual vents, memory valves.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Take the shortcut that erases you,'' ``Trade blood for passage,'' ``Leave a companion behind as toll.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Heart Pressure Rises''; Fracture: ``Floorplan Loops''; Anchor: ``Safe Route Fails.''
\paragraph{Complications} Corridors swap; keys rust to teeth; the Custodian forgets who asked.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} Camp cache; a mapping apprentice.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The stairwell adds a step every circuit.
\paragraph{Relief} Vent the Heart with a true name; feed it a secret belonging to all PCs (reduces Threat by one).
% ====== DUNGEON: PLUG-AND-PLAY EXTENSIONS ======

\subsection*{Plug-in Expedition Layer}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Universal Clocks (drop into any site):}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \emph{Dungeon Awareness (Heat)} [10]: rises on loud actions, light spillage, blood, or haste. At 4/7/10, the Keeper may promote Clubs results one step.
      \item \emph{Structure Stress} [6/8]: ticks on blasts, overloading mechanisms, or ignored warnings; when full, trigger \emph{Cascading Failure}.
      \item \emph{Expedition Supply}: three pooled tracks—\emph{Light} [4], \emph{Air} [4] (if sealed), \emph{Load} [4] (fatigue/overburden). Each empty track worsens Position for relevant actions until refreshed.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Safe Route Tokens:} On a strong success mapping/scouting, issue a \emph{Safe Route} token. Spend to bypass one known hazard in that segment or to negate a single “Position Lost” SB.
  \item \textbf{Retreat \& Seal:} When withdrawing, a PC may \emph{seal the way} (chalk, wedges, wards). Clear 1 Heat, but tick \emph{Structure Stress} or spawn a \emph{Phantom Lock} in that lane.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Interfaces \& Entanglements (use what fits your campaign)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Surface Stakeholders:} \emph{Scavenger Union}, \emph{Shrinekeepers}, \emph{Civic Factors}. Register finds to bank a \emph{Finder’s Favor}—spend to reduce one sell-off DV; skipping registration adds a “Disputed Claim” tag to the haul.
  \item \textbf{Internal Polities:} \emph{Custodians}, \emph{Bound Guardians}, \emph{Refugee Enclaves}. Parley with proper tokens (salt, names, warmth) to downgrade the next Clubs result in their turf.
  \item \textbf{Patron Hooks (optional):}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{The Sealed Gate:} Chalk lines cancel one intrusion for a scene; breaking them adds 1 Heat.
      \item \textbf{Lunara:} Moon-silver reveals one hidden organ (cistern, nerve-hall); mark Exposure +1.
      \item \textbf{The Traveler:} Waymarks let you finish one travel tick after a room clear.
      \item \textbf{Varnek Karn:} Naming the dead here clears 1 \emph{Awareness} but starts a \emph{Ledger Attention} [4].
      \item \textbf{Maelstraeus:} Trade salvage tags at “fair rate” once/expedition; skewed trades create a \emph{Karmic Debt} [6].
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Keys, Locks, \& Doors (drop-in schema)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Door Attitudes:} \emph{Literal} (wants the right key), \emph{Courteous} (opens to the right words), \emph{Hungry} (takes a toll), \emph{Shy} (hates crowds), \emph{Proud} (demands ceremony).
  \item \textbf{Key Types:} \emph{Mechanical} (wards/picks), \emph{Mnemonic} (password, name), \emph{Somatic} (gesture, breath), \emph{Affective} (emotion offered), \emph{Sacrificial} (blood, time, memory).
  \item \textbf{Rule of Two:} Each important barrier recognizes two different key types; learning either grants +1 Effect to breach or parley with it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Salvage, Haul, \& Conversion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Salvage Tags:} \emph{Stable} (safe to carry), \emph{Volatile} (ticks Stress on jostle), \emph{Bound} (linked to site), \emph{Loud} (adds Heat when moved), \emph{Forbidden} (attracts factions).
  \item \textbf{Convert on Exit (choose one):} trade haul for a \emph{Map that Grows} upgrade, a \emph{Pass-Key Writ} (one automatic door compliance), or \emph{Market Credit} (reduce next sell-off complication).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Table Prompts (d6 each, fast prep)}
\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
\textbf{Echo Questions}
\begin{enumerate}\item What does the room want?\item Who set this alarm?\item What was repaired last?\item Where does the draft go?\item What memory sticks here?\item What price opens the way?\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
\textbf{Find the Organ}
\begin{enumerate}\item Cistern (fluid)\item Bell-shaft (signal)\item Heat lung (thermal)\item Nerve-hall (control)\item Waste sluice (decay)\item Relay shrine (intent)\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}

\subsection*{Procedures at the Door (one-minute read-aloud checklist)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Sense:} Name two smells; ask which grew stronger.
  \item \textbf{Listen:} Offer one echo; ask what word returns wrong.
  \item \textbf{Light:} Describe color/behavior; ask who steadies it (hum, prayer, silence).
  \item \textbf{Count:} Beats, drips, or breaths—players may claim \emph{Counting Etiquette} to shift Position safer once.
  \item \textbf{Declare Price or Key:} Players state attitude + key type; on a hit, grant +1 Effect or a \emph{Safe Route} token.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Plug-in SB Conversions (use with any dungeon)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item First 1 SB in a scene may become \emph{Heat +1} instead of a narrative wrinkle (signal without immediate harm).
  \item Any 2 SB can instead tick \emph{Structure Stress} and foreshadow \emph{Cascading Failure} rather than spawn foes.
  \item On 3+ SB, offer a bargain: pay with \emph{memory/gear/time} to halve the consequence and add \emph{Price of Passage} [3].
\end{itemize}

% =========================
% DUNGEON — BOSSES & CRAWL LAYER
% =========================

\subsection*{Bosses \& Lairs (Classic Crawl Feel, Fate's Edge Framework)}
\label{sec:dungeon-bosses}

\paragraph{Using Bosses}
Each boss runs on a \textbf{Phase Clock} and 2--3 \textbf{Lair Actions}. Tie them to the site’s \emph{Dungeon Awareness (Heat)} and \emph{Structure Stress}; as either rises, promote boss position/effect. Boss defeats should yield a Diamond-tier boon keyed to the lair.

\subsubsection*{Oculus Warden (many-eyed sentry)}
\textit{A floating nerve-knot studded with glass eyes; lenses irise like gills.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Phase Clock:} \([8]\) \emph{Calibration \(\rightarrow\) Overwatch \(\rightarrow\) Lethal Focus \(\rightarrow\) Blind Panic}
  \item \textbf{Moves:} \emph{Disintegrate Signage} (erase waymarks), \emph{Anti-magic Glare} (downgrade 1 magical effect this exchange), \emph{Scry Ping} (advance Awareness +1).

  \begin{enumerate}\item \emph{Prismatic Sweep:} Split the party’s positions (each PC steps one tier toward Risky).\item \emph{Echo False Order:} One PC hears an ally’s command that was never given; test or waste an action.\item \emph{Lens Flare:} Next ranged attack against the Warden loses 1 Effect unless the light source is doused. \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Counters:} Smoke, darkness, reflective shields, calling shots on specific lenses (name a lens: cancel one Move this round).
  \item \textbf{Drop (Diamond):} \emph{Crown of Momentary Authority} or \emph{Lantern of Clarity}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Digestive Array (cube-that-crawls)}

  \item \textbf{Lair Actions (Sunken Vestibule / Chained Sanctuary):}
  \begin{enumerate}\item \emph{Flood Gate Twitch:} Water level rises a step; footing worsens.\item \emph{Sluice Pulse:} Pushes all creatures one range band.\item \emph{Reagent Bloom:} Vapors add --1 die to breathy actions this round. \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Counters:} Grates, cold cinders, base powders; lures with iron filings or salted meat (draw off for a scene).
  \item \textbf{Drop (Diamond):} \emph{Forge of Quick Repair} salvage or \emph{Ration of Sustenance} (3).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Ledger Lich (archivist revenant)}

  \item \textbf{Phase Clock:} \([8]\) \emph{Citation \(\rightarrow\) Injunction \(\rightarrow\) Foreclosure \(\rightarrow\) Redaction}
  \item \textbf{Moves:} \emph{Name Forfeiture} (steal a declared tag until bell), \emph{Writ of Seizure} (lock a Diamond or gear under spectral seal), \emph{Errata} (retroactively worsen one PC’s prior roll Outcome).
  \item \textbf{Lair Actions (Vault of Whispers / Deep Archive):}
  \begin{enumerate}\item \emph{Quiet Hours:} Casting/rites generate +1 SB or fail softly.\item \emph{Reference Only:} Movement through stacks costs an action unless proper tokens are presented.\item \emph{Cross-reference Collapse:} Bookshelves reconfigure; split the party. \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Counters:} True names carved in quartz, burning a citation (sacrifice an \emph{index}—a map, a ledger, a vow) to cancel one Move.
  \item \textbf{Drop (Diamond):} \emph{Key of Echoes}, \emph{Tome of Convenient Knowledge}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Protocol Titan (stone sentinel)}
\textit{A walking paragraph of law in granite; joints clock with tiny bells.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Phase Clock:} \([6]\) \emph{Challenge \(\rightarrow\) Adjudicate \(\rightarrow\) Execute}
  \item \textbf{Moves:} \emph{Ward Stomp} (shockwave; prone or position --), \emph{Clause Capture} (binds a PC to a declared rule), \emph{Countermeasure} (reflect mundane force).
  \item \textbf{Lair Actions (Measure Vault / Throne of Echoes):}
  \begin{enumerate}\item \emph{Bell of Standing:} Only those who declare an intent may act this round.\item \emph{Weigh Deceit:} The largest lie in the scene takes Harm 1 (Stress).\item \emph{Seal Turned:} A door the party used closes and locks under new terms. \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Counters:} Present certified measures, exploit contradictions, or swear a binding minor oath (shift boss Position --).
  \item \textbf{Drop (Diamond):} \emph{The Under-Seal Clause} (local), \emph{Key-Writ}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Mimetic Colony (door-that-eats)}
\textit{An ecosystem of impostor hinges, handles, chests, and carpets.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Phase Clock:} \([6]\) \emph{Invitation \(\rightarrow\) Adhesion \(\rightarrow\) Ingestion}
  \item \textbf{Moves:} \emph{Stickfast} (immobilize limb/gear), \emph{Swallow Noise} (negate assists), \emph{Split \& Flank}.
  \item \textbf{Lair Actions (Armory / Garden of Stone):}
  \begin{enumerate}\item \emph{Everything’s a Mouth:} First interacted object bites.\item \emph{False Safe:} Creates a “short rest” that actually advances Heat +2.\item \emph{Chew Through:} Destroys one rung/bridge segment. \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Counters:} Iron spikes, chalk lines, bait boxes; fire/acid cause the colony to fragment (treat as minions).
  \item \textbf{Drop (Diamond):} \emph{Cloak of Passage}, \emph{Token of Safe Return}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Sluice Dragon (steam \& acid wyrm)}
\textit{A heat lung grown proud; scales are boiler plates, breath a flash-boil scream.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Phase Clock:} \([10]\) \emph{Banked Heat \(\rightarrow\) Pressure Rise \(\rightarrow\) Vent Fury \(\rightarrow\) Rupture}

  \item \textbf{Lair Actions (Heat Lungs / Cistern):}
  \begin{enumerate}\item \emph{Valve Spin:} Change terrain tags (Dry/Wet/Boiling).\item \emph{Gauge Pop:} Structure Stress +1; cracks form.\item \emph{Pressure Shadow:} The dragon gains +1 Effect for one exchange. \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Counters:} Chill the room (dump cistern), bleed valves (two actions), or bait with metal ingots.
  \item \textbf{Drop (Diamond):} \emph{Forge of Quick Repair}, \emph{Shield of Temporary Immunity}.
\end{itemize}

% -------------------------
\subsection*{Crawl Procedures (Quick, Crunchy Options)}
\label{sec:dungeon-crawl-proc}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Short Rest (10 minutes):} Clear Fatigue 1 \emph{or} refresh one spent tool; advance \emph{Dungeon Awareness} +1 and roll once on \emph{Ambient Signs} (below).
  \item \textbf{Secure Camp (1 hour, defensible):} Clear Fatigue 2 and one \emph{Condition} (not Harm); \emph{Structure Stress} +1d2 from barricading/heat, Awareness +2 unless \emph{Sealed}.
  \item \textbf{Search a Room (5 minutes):} On success, gain 1 \emph{Safe Route} token \emph{or} a \emph{Map that Grows} tick; on miss, trigger a \emph{Door Attitude} complication.
  \item \textbf{Light, Air, Load:} Track three pooled clocks [4] (see Plug-in Expedition Layer). Empty tracks worsen Position until restored.
\end{itemize}

% -------------------------
\subsection*{Wandering Signs \& Encounters (d12)}
\label{sec:dungeon-wander}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Whisper returns one word wrong; nearest door adopts a \emph{Hungry} attitude.
  \item Drip changes rhythm; nearby \emph{Gravity Well} awakens.
  \item Custodian chalk erased and redrawn \emph{behind} you.
  \item A stack exhales: \emph{Memory Fog} for one exchange.
  \item Pilfer-vermin court demands toll (crumbs, salt, \emph{or} gossip).
  \item Bound Guardian patrol, willing to debate terms (papers help).
  \item Refugee child with a \emph{Key of Echoes} that hates you.
  \item Floor warms; \emph{Heat Lung} cycling—steam hazard next room.
  \item Echo sermon on “proper doors”; ignoring it adds Heat +1.
  \item Sloshing in walls; \emph{Digestive Array} scouts with a filament.
  \item A mirror shows your gear two items lighter—choose which or mark Fatigue 1.
  \item Stone hymn—sing along to cancel first SB this scene, or suffer \emph{Hungering Dark} pulse.
\end{enumerate}

% -------------------------
\subsection*{Classic Traps, Living-Site Style (pick 1–2 tags)}
\label{sec:dungeon-traps}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Pressure Mosaic} (Artful, Loud): Floor pattern asks for a dance step; wrong beat drops spears from \emph{ceiling}, not floor.
  \item \textbf{Breath Tax} (Subtle, Lingering): Room meters exhalations; excess vents sleeping gas; counting etiquette downgrades risk.
  \item \textbf{Magi-Siphon Grate} (Hungry, Magnetic): Drains charges from tools/wards; feeding it a \emph{Focus Crystal} buys safe passage.
  \item \textbf{Echo Latch} (Riddle, Social): Door opens to a truth spoken softly; lies trigger \emph{Phantom Locks}.
\end{itemize}

% -------------------------
\subsection*{Treasure \& Upgrade Hooks (d8 hoard seeds)}
\label{sec:dungeon-loot}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cage of \emph{tame echoes}—store a sentence for later; release as perfect mimicry.
  \item \emph{Map that Grows} (upgraded): shows \emph{organs} (cistern/nerve-hall) when rubbed with tallow.

  \item \emph{Key-ring of Attitudes}: once each—\emph{Courteous}, \emph{Hungry}, \emph{Proud}.
  \item Bottle of \emph{stolen seasons}: pour to set room to \emph{pollen-sweet} or \emph{knife-cold} for one scene.
  \item \emph{Token of Safe Return} (party-wide) that tugs twice when the \emph{Heart Pressure} hits threshold.
  \item A ledger page signed by the \emph{Dungeon’s Creator}—treat one barrier as if you are expected.
  \item \emph{Lantern of Clarity} mantle: once/session, reveals the \emph{Price of Passage} without paying it.

\subsection*{Boss Build Template (one-minute prep)}
\label{sec:dungeon-boss-template}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Name \& Nature:} What organ of the dungeon is this boss the face of?
  \item \textbf{Phase Clock:} 6/8/10 with 2–4 titled phases.
  \item \textbf{Three Moves:} One space-control, one resource-tax, one identity/knowledge twist.
  \item \textbf{Two Lair Actions:} Environmental toggles keyed to this lair.
  \item \textbf{Counters:} A courtesy, a tool, a sacrifice. (Players should be able to \emph{learn} these.)
  \item \textbf{Drop:} A Diamond (from \S\ref{sec:dungeon-rewards}) or bespoke boon tied to the organ.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Dungeon Boss: The Heart Itself (set-piece)}
\label{sec:dungeon-heart-boss}
\textit{A chamber of ribs and lintels; mortar smells like blood, light like fever.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Phase Clock:} \([10]\) \emph{Palpate \(\rightarrow\) Synchronize \(\rightarrow\) Pacemaker \(\rightarrow\) Arrest}
  \item \textbf{Moves:} \emph{Syncopate} (force actions to resolve off-beat; assist dice misfire), \emph{Tachycardia} (Heat +2, Structure Stress +1), \emph{Backflow} (reverse one clock tick on \emph{Floorplan Loops}, but split the party).
  \item \textbf{Lair Actions:}
  \begin{enumerate}\item \emph{Valve Close:} Seal exits; require a “Somatic” or “Affective” key to reopen.\item \emph{Adrenal Surge:} The Heart acts twice next round unless fed a secret \emph{all PCs share}. \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Counters:} Speak the dungeon’s \emph{true purpose} (as inferred via organs), vent a heat lung, or sacrifice mapped ground (tear up a \emph{Safe Route}).
  \item \textbf{Victory States:} \emph{Stabilize} (site becomes safer; Awareness clears to 0), \emph{Pacify} (gain \emph{Dungeon’s Blessing}), or \emph{Slay} (collapse risk; Structure Stress +2 across the level).
\end{itemize}
