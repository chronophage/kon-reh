\section{Zakov --- ``Salt \& Serpent''}
\label{chap:zakov}

\subsection*{Elite (Salt Prince)}
\textit{``The tide here keeps better ledgers than any scribe, and the reefs remember every secret whispered above their depths. Power flows like the currents – those who understand them rule the waves.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Dock-rat pickpocket with map tattoo and no fear)}
\textit{``The sewers and the sea both carry what folks want to forget, but they also remember everything. Best keep your business above water and your enemies guessing which dock you'll use next.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Zakov is the pirate-city of the Dolmis coast, where tides trade secrets and knives settle debts. Its streets are piers, its courts are taverns, and its rulers are whoever the Syndicates fear most this season. The Salt Prince claims the throne, but the real power ebbs and flows with the tide---and the tide remembers everything.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:zakov-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (passes/contracts/goods) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{salt \& serpent} motifs---tides that remember, reefs that shift, deep that listens.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Tide Clock:} Scenes run on four-segment \textbf{Tide Clock}. Each advance shifts Position: \emph{Low tide} reveals hidden wrecks/bolt-holes, \emph{Flood tide} drowns streets/seals doors. When Clock turns, Keeper may demand 1 SB tied to waters.
\item \textbf{Syndicate Debt:} Every deal leaves mark. Track single \textbf{Debt} value (0--3). At 3, Syndicate calls it in: betrayal, levy, unwanted escort. Clear 1 Debt by paying Diamond or sacrificing useful contact.
\item \textbf{Whispers Deep:} Rumors carry teeth. When characters openly boast/bargain/betray, roll 1d6: 1--3: Whispers spread, increasing SB generation. 4--6: Whispers favor PCs, lowering suspicion until tide turns.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Zakov, power flows through the control of smuggling routes, the management of syndicate debts, and the ability to navigate the complex web of pirate politics. The Salt Prince maintains nominal authority, but real power lies with those who control the tides, the reefs, and the flow of information through the city's taverns and black markets. The true authorities are those who can provide safe passage, protect cargoes, and mediate between competing syndicates.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Zakov revolves around smuggling rights, safe harbors, and the ability to provide protection from both legal and illegal authorities. Rewards often take the form of tokens, charters, and safe passage that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, manifests, keys) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival syndicates issue conflicting protections, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the docks, taverns, and smuggling routes as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of custom and connections determine success.
\end{itemize}
In Zakov, your reputation is your wealth, and your wealth determines whether you rule the waves or feed the fishes.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Zakov — Salt and Serpent}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A smuggler’s gate built into the seawall, its iron mouth crusted with barnacles and secrets.
\begin{quote}
“In Zakov, the sea remembers its debts, and every tide drags a name to pay.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Smuggler’s Gate, a Fence offers a forged manifest. ``The Salt Prince’s levy rises,'' they say. ``And the tide forgets who paid.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Salt levies, river smugglers, eel cults, threshold markets.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Take a bribe,'' ``Change the manifest,'' ``Drown the witness.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Levy Teeth''; Community: ``Smuggler War''; Anchor: ``Gate Truce.''
\paragraph{Complications} Eels spell names; brine coins multiply; gates open to water.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A dockside aunt; a tide-warden.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The manifest adds the party’s cargo.
\paragraph{Relief} Pay the levy in kind; throw the coin-chain back; swear the Gate to a new keeper.

\subsection*{City Operating System (Fast Play)}

\paragraph{Tide-State (4)}
Track a \textbf{Tide Clock} (Low \textrightarrow{} Flood \textrightarrow{} Slack \textrightarrow{} Ebb).  
At each shift: 
\begin{itemize}
\item change \textbf{Position}: Low (+Infiltration), Flood (-Mobility), Slack (+Deals), Ebb (+Getaway).
\item Keeper may bank 1 SB tied to \emph{water, rot, or rumor}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Heat \& Debt}
Track \textbf{Heat} (0--4) and \textbf{Debt} (0--3) citywide.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Heat} rises on noisy jobs; at 4, a \emph{Syndicate Split} tick or \emph{Naval Blockade} rumor triggers.
\item \emph{Debt} rises when you stiff a faction; at 3, a creditor picks the next scene's complication.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Crew Playbooks (pick one tag)}
\emph{Cutters} (+Effect on coercion at Crimson Docks); \emph{Ghosts} (ignore first Tide penalty each job); \emph{Lighters} (cargo swaps create 1 \textbf{Forged Manifest} per session); \emph{Lanterns} (fae bargains count as Diamonds once/session).

\subsection*{Signal, Cipher, \& Circuitry}

\paragraph{Harbor Flash (d6 quick comms)}
1 one-lantern (safe) \quad 2 two-lantern (watch) \quad 3 red rag (fire) \quad 4 black gull (hit) \quad 5 three knocks (meet) \quad 6 eel-twine (fae eyes)

\paragraph{Dock Cant (micro-phrases)}
“wet ledger” = bribe; “green rope” = cursed cargo; “white rain” = blockade rumor; “dead wake” = tail on you.

\paragraph{Shadow-Net}
Each \emph{Crow’s Roost}/tavern can host one \textbf{Cache}: 3 rumors total; \emph{spend} 1 rumor to bump Position on info-gathering. When emptied, add +1 \textbf{Heat}.

\subsection*{The Fae Leak}

\paragraph{Saltbound Rules}
Fae cannot \emph{enter} a circle salted with \textbf{tidewater salt}, but can \emph{bargain} across it. Breaking circle = 1 SB and a personal \emph{Mark}.

\paragraph{Eel Court}
Wharf-spirits (eel-hooded) adjudicate vows “where water hears.” Presenting a \textbf{Serpent’s Mark} lets you reroute a single clause in a contract once.

\paragraph{Drowned Names}
Names thrown from \emph{Bone-Yard Beach} return as \emph{Echo Debtors}. Cash one to erase 1 \textbf{Debt}—but the name occasionally speaks from your mouth.

\subsection*{Heist Skeletons (Plug \& Play)}

\paragraph{The Manifest Swap (3 beats)}
\textbf{Beat 1:} \emph{Entry} (Smuggler’s Gate or Sunken Quarter); on miss, \emph{Tide Shift}.  
\textbf{Beat 2:} \emph{Edit} (swap bill at Dock-Master); spend \textbf{Forged Manifest} to auto-pass.  
\textbf{Beat 3:} \emph{Exit} (Shallows); fail = \emph{Cursed Cargo} wakes.

\paragraph{Anchorhead Skim (4 beats)}
\textbf{Case} a ledger \textrightarrow{} \textbf{Turn} a clerk \textrightarrow{} \textbf{Lift} a page \textrightarrow{} \textbf{Ghost} on the Iron Pier. Any alarm = \emph{Prince’s Levy} this scene.

\subsection*{Syndicate Play (Mini-Game)}

\paragraph{Stacks \& Faces}
Pick a patron \emph{Stack} each arc: \textbf{Red Wake} (muscle), \textbf{Silent Syndicate} (intel), \textbf{Salt Prince} (papers).  
During downtime, exchange \emph{Faces} (favors) for one of: reduce \textbf{Heat} by 1; clear 1 \textbf{Debt}; mint one \textbf{Black Ledger} page (one-use leverage on any named).

\paragraph{War Track (0--6)}
Each conflicting job advances \textbf{War}; at 3, \emph{Blood Feud}; at 6, \emph{Syndicate Split}. Reset if PCs deliver a \textbf{Queen’s Blessing} or sacrifice a crew asset.

\subsection*{Urban Terrain \& Glitches}

\paragraph{Glitch Table (fae-punk fuzz, d8)}
1 door opens to water \quad 2 lantern whispers your alias \quad 3 rope grows kelp \quad 4 coin tastes like brine and lies  
5 footprints go opposite \quad 6 eel writes your name \quad 7 reef sound indoors \quad 8 tide remembers a promise you didn’t make

\paragraph{Zones (quick tags)}
\emph{Dregs:} +Stealth, -Status; \emph{Crimson:} +Force, -Subtle; \emph{Sunken:} +Weird, -Mobility; \emph{Salt Maze:} +Escape, -Clarity.

\subsection*{NPC Templates}

\paragraph{Kraken’s Tongue (Oracle)}
\emph{Wants:} Tribute in secrets. \quad \emph{Leverage:} once/session convert a \textbf{Club} to a \textbf{Diamond}. \quad \emph{Cost:} forget a friend’s face for a night.

\paragraph{Dock-Master Briga}
\emph{Wants:} A rival’s ledger singe. \quad \emph{Leverage:} “lose” any hull for a day. \quad \emph{Cost:} your real name in her book.

\paragraph{Pirate Queen Mael}
\emph{Wants:} A tide-warden compromised. \quad \emph{Leverage:} \textbf{Queen’s Blessing}. \quad \emph{Cost:} carry her mark where it shows.

\subsection*{Contraband \& Curses}

\paragraph{Hot List (d6)}
1 saint-glass (screams when lied to) \quad 2 eel-ink (writes back) \quad 3 tide-bell (rings at wrong hour)  
4 serpent charts (reef moves for bearer) \quad 5 name-wine (drink a memory) \quad 6 drowned coins (buy help, cost breath)

\paragraph{Tagging Cargo}
Each illicit lot has 1 \emph{Tag}: \textbf{Watching}, \textbf{Hungry}, \textbf{Bound}, \textbf{Cold}. Tag can be “disarmed” by the right shrine/fee/contact.

\subsection*{Cross-Region Conversions}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Theona:} \emph{Smuggler’s Token} counts as \emph{Hawthorn Pass} if bells play eight; a ninth sound voids both.
\item \textbf{Viterra:} \emph{Prince’s Writ} can masquerade as \emph{Customs Seal} for one audit before \emph{Audit Freeze} ticks.
\item \textbf{Ubral:} \emph{Black Ledger} page buys one night of \emph{Guest-Token}—if read aloud at Wergild Ford.
\item \textbf{Vhasia:} \emph{Lighthouse Key} spoofs a beacon on \emph{Beacon Crown}/King’s High Road ferries once.
\item \textbf{Valewood:} \emph{Serpent’s Mark} = one-scene \emph{Way-Cord} if dipped in Moon-Cistern.
\item \textbf{Ways Between:} A complete \emph{Forged Manifest} recited at a \emph{Threshold Arch} becomes a \emph{Passage Token}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Clocks \& Pressures}

\paragraph{Levy Teeth (6)}
1–2: Quayside “inspections” \quad 3–4: Tithe brigades \quad 5: Fire at the wrong warehouse \quad 6: Floating gallows at Anchorhead.

\paragraph{Smuggler War (6)}
1–2: Protection doubled \quad 3–4: Routes trapped \quad 5: Crews defect \quad 6: Open water gunwales—everyone draws steel.

\paragraph{Gate Truce (4)}
1: Coins tied on rope \quad 2–3: Gate stays “neutral” \quad 4: New Keeper named; reroute \emph{Tide Clock} once/session.

\subsection*{Score Seeds}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Eel That Spoke:} A \emph{Cursed Cargo} eel whispers court gossip from Thepyrgos; bottle it before \emph{Syndicate Split}.
\item \textbf{Red Wake’s Shadow:} Lift a \emph{Black Ledger} page naming the Salt Prince’s heir; payment is \emph{Prince’s Coin}—and a knife in the dark.
\item \textbf{Lighthouse Down:} Swap the \emph{Lighthouse Key} during a storm; success grants \emph{Kraken’s Favor}, fail triggers \emph{Naval Blockade}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Designer Hooks (Optional)}

\paragraph{Reefburn}
When you voluntarily take \emph{Heat} to make a daring move, mark \emph{Reefburn}. Once per session, spend \emph{Reefburn} to treat the \emph{Serpent’s Spine} as a safe exit regardless of tide—something else pays the price later.

\paragraph{Name-Mask}
Craft a single-scene alias with eel-ink; while worn, your \textbf{Heat} ticks to the mask, not you. If the mask “dies,” transfer 1 \textbf{Debt} to the faction who owned the name you stole.
