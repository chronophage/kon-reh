\section{Acasia --- ``Broken Marches''}
\label{chap:acasia}

Acasia is a scar across the map---a land of famine-slick fields, ruined abbeys, and banners nailed to every hill. Once an Imperial heartland, it fell swiftly when plague and curse gnawed its seams, leaving warlords, mercenaries, and saints-for-hire to feast on what remained. The Rothari Clan rules their stretch of the marches with mailed fist and gallows law, but beyond their walls, a king sits in every ruin, and every bride carries daggers under her veil.

\section*{Spades --- Places (passes, ruins, blackwoods, toll-towns)}
\label{sec:acasia-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Broken milestone on the old Imperial Road; borders ``moved'' overnight.
\item Vine-terrace hillside with an abandoned press; strangler ivy owns it now.
\item Toll-bridge town over a cold river---two tolls, no receipts.
\item Wolfstairs Pass switchbacks beneath a stonefall cliff.
\item Sootfall Abbey ruins; bell tower intact, crypts breathing.
\item Hill-motte with fresh palisade; ditch scattered with caltrops.
\item Border-stone ring carved with seven crowns; each points wrong.
\item Blackwood charcoalers' hollow; witch-posts at every path.
\item Salt-road ford; rains expose old bones in the chalk banks.
\item[J] Iron mine adits held by a miners' commune; air full of whispers.
\item[Q] Margravine's hunting lodge; tapestries of victories that never were.
\item[K] War-camp city---tents around a burned keep; every banner claims the throne.
\item[A] The Pale Causeway: the last high road that survives spring thaws.
\end{enumerate}

\item ``King'' of three villages; iron-nail crown, iron-will taxes.
\item[J] Bride with no dowry but a claim; daggers in the wedding chest.
\item[Q] Margravine of the Broken March---half-saint, half tax-roll.

\item[A] The Cursed Child of Silkstrand (a rumor more than a person) whose laughter ends sieges.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (feud, levy, weather, curse)}
\label{sec:acasia-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Peat-fog; all horns sound like someone calling your name.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Border-stone adjustment---move a line two fields over.
\item Pass-key charm recognized by Pale Causeway watchmen.
\item Sealed dowry chest of claims, not coin; certain doors open.
\item Mine-share in the commune; they fight like they mean it.
\item[J] Blood-peace charter; suspend a feud long enough to move your wagons.
\item[Q] Marriage proxy from the Margravine---bind a hill-king to your cause.
\item[K] The Lame King's traveling writ---troops must make way (for now).
\item[A] Curse-redemption rite (temporary): for one night no crossroads can hold you.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:acasia-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (papers/claims/safe-conducts) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo plague \& curse motifs---crossroads that turn back on themselves, bells tolling for no funeral, banners blackened by mildew.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Feud as Currency:} Any insult, accident, or rumor can birth a feud; GMs may replace a SB result with a feud-token tied to a petty lord or house.
\item \textbf{Rot \& Tithe:} Each market or harvest scene carries a risk of rot---add a pressure if food or coin are exchanged without blessing or seal.
\item \textbf{The Curse Remembers:} When roads or negotiations stall, the GM may quietly repeat imagery---crossroads, whispers, mildew---to remind players that Acasia itself resists resolution.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Decline \& Patronage}]
Acasia rots in the space between famine and ambition. Every hill wears a crown, every bridge bears a toll, and every road curves back to the same cursed crossroads. Where once the Empire’s coin and grain flowed, now tithe-collectors gnaw the marrow of starving villages, and warlords dress themselves as kings.

Patronage here is as brittle as candle wax. The Rothari Clan holds their marches by fear and iron law---patronage from them is real, but cruel, demanding service in blood or levy. Elsewhere, noble names are little more than titles printed on parchment and sold like debts. The Margravine keeps a ledger like scripture, binding feuds to her feast days, while mercenary captains trade loyalty for coin, switching colors with each bell.

To seek a patron in Acasia is to choose which hunger you will feed: the Rothari’s iron teeth, a Free Company’s purse, or the hollow blessing of a saint who may never have lived. Yet even false crowns cast shadows long enough to shelter those desperate enough to kneel.
