\section{Acasia --- ``Broken Marches''}
\label{chap:acasia}

\subsection*{Elite (Margravine of the Broken March)}
\textit{``The tithe must be paid, not merely offered. A promise written in ash and sealed with iron will is worth more than a thousand gold coins scattered on the wind.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Hedge-witch who knows which bridges eat travelers)}
\textit{``Don't cross the Pale Causeway at dusk, especially not if you've got a silver tooth. The bridge'll remember it, and next time you pass, it'll want more than just your footfall.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Famine \& Ambition}]
Acasia is a former province of the Utaran Empire that rots in the space between famine and ambition. Every hill wears a crown, every bridge bears a toll, and every road curves back to the same cursed crossroads. Where once the Empire's coin and grain flowed, now tithe-collectors gnaw the marrow of starving villages, and warlords dress themselves as kings.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:acasia-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (papers/claims/safe-conducts) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo plague \& curse motifs---crossroads that turn back on themselves, bells tolling for no funeral, banners blackened by mildew.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Feud as Currency:} Any insult, accident, or rumor can birth a feud; GMs may replace a SB result with a feud-token tied to a petty lord or house.
\item \textbf{Rot \& Tithe:} Each market or harvest scene carries a risk of rot---add a pressure if food or coin are exchanged without blessing or seal.
\item \textbf{The Curse Remembers:} When roads or negotiations stall, the GM may quietly repeat imagery---crossroads, whispers, mildew---to remind players that Acasia itself resists resolution.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Decline \& Patronage}]
Patronage here is as brittle as candle wax. The Rothari Clan holds their marches by fear and iron law---patronage from them is real, but cruel, demanding service in blood or levy. Elsewhere, noble names are little more than titles printed on parchment and sold like debts. The Margravine keeps a ledger like scripture, binding feuds to her feast days, while mercenary captains trade loyalty for coin, switching colors with each bell.

To seek a patron in Acasia is to choose which hunger you will feed: the Rothari's iron teeth, a Free Company's purse, or the hollow blessing of a saint who may never have lived. Yet even false crowns cast shadows long enough to shelter those desperate enough to kneel.

\item \textbf{Narrative Pivot:} The story takes an unexpected turn that reframes objectives
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Region-Specific SB Options}
Each region generator should include 2-3 custom SB spends that reflect its unique themes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Acasia (Rot \& Curse):} Crossroads that loop back, mildew-blackened banners, bells tolling for no funeral
\item \textbf{Acasia (Feud):} A bloodline takes offense; you're named in a toast to vengeance
\item \textbf{Acasia (Tithes):} A collector arrives early; your passage now costs twice the grain
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Acasia — The Olde Tavern}
\textbf{Starting Location:} The Pale Causeway’s last inn, walls soot‑blackened by coal and gossip, where a bounty poster flutters beside a half‑empty hearth.
\begin{quote}
“In Acasia, every bargain is an echo of a promise once broken, and every drink tastes faintly of debt.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} The Pale Causeway's last inn, a Margravine's bounty poster flutters in the soot-stained hearth. A stranger at the bar offers the party a sealed contract: retrieve a dowry chest from a Blackwood matriarch… or die trying.
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Oath-script, soot and vellum, ledger-sorcery, ink that dries to sigils.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Sign without reading,'' ``Hide the original,'' ``Burn the witness list.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``The Dowry Wakes''; Community: ``Guild Panic''; Anchor: ``The Inn’s Safe Conduct.''
\paragraph{Complications} Contract has a second signer; the hearth remembers names; the Blackwood writes back.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} Innkeeper’s child archivist; a PC’s oath-scrip.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The poster adds a PC’s portrait.
\paragraph{Relief} Confess the contract’s hidden clause to those harmed; spend 2 \Boons{} to render the writ inert for a scene; or return the chest unopened.

\subsection*{Faction Entanglements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Free Companies:} Marching through Acasia with existing contracts or debts to mercenaries automatically increases SB by +1 per leg of travel.
  \item \textbf{Church of the Flame:} Priests press claims of tithe and sanctuary; favor with them grants food and shelter, enmity ensures blocked roads.
  \item \textbf{Rothari Clan:} Known for iron-law levies. Any insult or refusal of tax risks feud-tokens lasting the whole arc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cross-Regional Ties}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Silkstrand:} Dowry disputes in Acasia often echo into Silkstrand’s guild halls; any result involving marriage or feuds may ripple south.
  \item \textbf{Kahfagia:} Control of ford-roads determines who reaches western ports; Kahfagian traders quietly fund toll-lords here.
  \item \textbf{Aeler:} Underpass and grain routes tie Acasia’s survival to Aeler markets. Any famine result may also trigger shortages in Aeler.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Trade Goods \& Consequences}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Salt:} Salt-rights in Acasia fuel both cuisine and preservation across Vhasia and Mistlands. Monopolies here can shift entire caravans.
  \item \textbf{Iron:} Acasian iron feeds both Aeler smiths and Vilikari steppe cavalry. Control of mines changes military balances.
  \item \textbf{Wine:} Abandoned terraces yield forgotten vintages prized in Theona; recovery can turn famine into fortune.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Patron Networks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Sealed Gate:} Wards abbeys, ruined keeps, and iron-bound bridges — their symbols are recognized by abjurists across borders.
  \item \textbf{Maelstraeus:} His bargains ripple through Acasia’s mercenary contracts. A deal here can suddenly shift allegiance in faraway wars.
  \item \textbf{The Traveler:} Hidden shrines mark crossroads; those who tithe gain safe passage rumors, those who spurn them meet false milestones.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Diplomatic Favor \& Reputation Echoes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Earning \textbf{Diplomatic Favor} from resolving a feud or famine peacefully grants a reusable token: spend to reduce DV on travel through Acasia or its neighbors.
  \item \textbf{Reputation Echoes:} Reputation in Acasia carries into Silkstrand and Kahfagia. A PC who breaks feuds here may be greeted in Kahfagia as a “feud-binder” — or as “coward who yielded” depending on faction.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Decline \& Patronage}]
Patronage here is brittle as candle wax. The Rothari Clan rules by fear and levy. Elsewhere, noble names are debts for sale, and mercenary captains trade colors with the bells. To kneel in Acasia is to choose which hunger to feed: iron law, mercenary purse, or hollow saint. Even false crowns cast shadows long enough to shelter the desperate.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Boss Archetypes in Acasia}
\label{sec:acasia-bosses}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The False King (Feud/Authority):} A petty lord or pretender who crowns themselves on the ruins of empire. Often defended by mercenaries or cursed oaths. 
  \item \textbf{The Witch of the Blackwoods (Witchcraft/Curse):} A hedge-witch, matriarch, or revenant who manipulates feuds and curses; battlefield is her hollow or a haunted toll-bridge. 
  \item \textbf{The Tithe Collector (Greed/Extortion):} Not a warrior but a bureaucrat-priest with writs, escorts, and the ability to summon feuds or famine with a single decree.
  \item \textbf{The Rotting Child (Mystery/Curse):} A folkloric horror tied to Acasia’s plague of false crossroads. Their laughter can end sieges but at terrible cost. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Boss Mechanics Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Feud Tokens} act as lair actions — once per round, the Boss escalates a feud between NPC factions, pulling reinforcements or sabotaging PCs. 
  \item \emph{Crossroads Curse} may loop failed escapes back into the same scene until the curse is broken. 
  \item Boss arenas often include \emph{Tithe-Ledgers}, \emph{Burned Abbeys}, or \emph{Bridge-Feasts} that the GM can trigger as SB complications. 
\end{itemize}
