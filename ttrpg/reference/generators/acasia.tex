\end{enumerate}

Clubs --- Complications/Threats (feud, levy, weather, curse)
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Peat-fog; all horns sound like someone calling your name.
\item Sudden levy---every traveler pressed for a day's service.
\item Bridge feud; rival banners drop the chain on your cart.

\item Border-stone adjustment---move a line two fields over.

\item[K] The Lame King's traveling writ---troops must make way (for now).
\item[A] Curse-redemption rite (temporary): for one night no crossroads can hold you.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick Use Notes}
\label{sec:acasia-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (blessings/tokens/host-rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo Hearth \& Hollow motifs---quiet bells, red thread, watch-geese, footsteps under the soil---so the dread feels woven through the hedges.
\end{itemize}
