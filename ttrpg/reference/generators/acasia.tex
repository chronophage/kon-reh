\section{Acasia --- ``Broken Marches''}
\label{chap:acasia}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Famine \& Ambition}]
Acasia rots in the space between famine and ambition. Every hill wears a crown, every bridge bears a toll, and every road curves back to the same cursed crossroads. Where once the Empire's coin and grain flowed, now tithe-collectors gnaw the marrow of starving villages, and warlords dress themselves as kings.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:acasia-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (papers/claims/safe-conducts) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo plague \& curse motifs---crossroads that turn back on themselves, bells tolling for no funeral, banners blackened by mildew.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Feud as Currency:} Any insult, accident, or rumor can birth a feud; GMs may replace a SB result with a feud-token tied to a petty lord or house.
\item \textbf{Rot \& Tithe:} Each market or harvest scene carries a risk of rot---add a pressure if food or coin are exchanged without blessing or seal.
\item \textbf{The Curse Remembers:} When roads or negotiations stall, the GM may quietly repeat imagery---crossroads, whispers, mildew---to remind players that Acasia itself resists resolution.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Decline \& Patronage}]
Patronage here is as brittle as candle wax. The Rothari Clan holds their marches by fear and iron law---patronage from them is real, but cruel, demanding service in blood or levy. Elsewhere, noble names are little more than titles printed on parchment and sold like debts. The Margravine keeps a ledger like scripture, binding feuds to her feast days, while mercenary captains trade loyalty for coin, switching colors with each bell.

To seek a patron in Acasia is to choose which hunger you will feed: the Rothari's iron teeth, a Free Company's purse, or the hollow blessing of a saint who may never have lived. Yet even false crowns cast shadows long enough to shelter those desperate enough to kneel.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Region-Specific SB Options}
Each region generator should include 2-3 custom SB spends that reflect its unique themes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Acasia (Rot \& Curse):} Crossroads that loop back, mildew-blackened banners, bells tolling for no funeral
\item \textbf{Acasia (Feud):} A bloodline takes offense; you're named in a toast to vengeance
\item \textbf{Acasia (Tithes):} A collector arrives early; your passage now costs twice the grain
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Acasia — The Olde Tavern}
\textbf{Starting Location:} The Pale Causeway’s last inn, walls soot‑blackened by coal and gossip, where a bounty poster flutters beside a half‑empty hearth.
\begin{quote}
“In Acasia, every bargain is an echo of a promise once broken, and every drink tastes faintly of debt.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} The Pale Causeway's last inn, a Margravine's bounty poster flutters in the soot-stained hearth. A stranger at the bar offers the party a sealed contract: retrieve a dowry chest from a Blackwood matriarch… or die trying.
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Oath-script, soot and vellum, ledger-sorcery, ink that dries to sigils.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Sign without reading,'' ``Hide the original,'' ``Burn the witness list.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``The Dowry Wakes''; Community: ``Guild Panic''; Anchor: ``The Inn’s Safe Conduct.''
\paragraph{Complications} Contract has a second signer; the hearth remembers names; the Blackwood writes back.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} Innkeeper’s child archivist; a PC’s oath-scrip.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The poster adds a PC’s portrait.
\paragraph{Relief} Confess the contract’s hidden clause to those harmed; spend 2 \Boons{} to render the writ inert for a scene; or return the chest unopened.
