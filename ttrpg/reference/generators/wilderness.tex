\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Seed with 4 cards (ensure all four suits): Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes---rights, passes, windows---that change position rather than call for a test.
\item If an A appears, add a lingering omen of the land (a smell on the wind, a sound that carries too far) you can echo in later scenes.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Fast reskin palette}
\begin{description}
\item[Forest] swap dunes$\rightarrow$deadfall, spindrift$\rightarrow$canopy flare, prowlers$\rightarrow$boar/wolves; water = spring/stream.
\item[Desert] swap bog$\rightarrow$salt pan, fog$\rightarrow$dust, shelter = overhang/wadi; water = seep/fog net.
\item[Tundra/Ice] swap dune shift$\rightarrow$ice heave, fire$\rightarrow$spindrift, boats$\rightarrow$sleds; prowlers = bears/wolves.
\item[Coast/Isles] crossings = reef shelves, prowlers = seals/raiders, alarms = harbor booms; fuel = driftwood.
\item[Swamp/Fen] crossings = corduroy/log causeways, bad ground = peat crust, prowlers = gators/leeches.
\item[Highlands] crossings = cols and scree traverses, alarms = beacon chains, prowlers = cats/eagles.
\end{description}
