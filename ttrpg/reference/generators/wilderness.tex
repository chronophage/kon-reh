\section{The Wilds --- ``Roads, Ruins, and Weather''}
\label{chap:wilderness}

\subsection*{Elite (Claimant Chief)}
\textit{``These lands answer not to charters but to those who can read their signs and respect their moods. Authority here is earned one campfire at a time, by proving you understand the difference between claiming and belonging.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Forager child with truer maps than yours)}
\textit{``The wilds don't need your roads or your rules – they got their own ways of keeping score. Follow the cairns if you want to live, and always leave something behind to thank the land for letting you pass.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Between towns and treaties lies the patience of the land. Old roads remember armies; cairns remember names no book keeps. In the Wilds, law thins to trail-marks and favors, and the weather keeps its own counsel. Walk soft, read the wind, and bargain with whatever still listens.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:wilderness-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (cache/pass/favor) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, add lingering omen of land (smell on wind, sound that carries too far, tracks that shift) you can echo in later scenes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Trail Rights:} Some paths older than borders. Display right token (knot, bead, bark-sigil) turns strangers into neighbors for one camp's length; break custom and road forgets you.
\item \textbf{Weather-Lore:} Winds carry messages: resin-scent before lightning, hush before spindrift, birdsong that stops at once. Read aloud at table to bias Position before roll.
\item \textbf{Road Spirits:} Shrines at cairns and waystones prefer small courtesies: water poured, pebble placed, name spoken. Keep them and land is kinder; slight them and land remembers.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In the Wilds, power flows through knowledge of the land, the ability to navigate without formal authority, and the careful cultivation of local relationships. True authority comes from understanding weather patterns, reading tracks, and maintaining the favor of both human inhabitants and the spirits of place. Those who can provide safe passage, find water in dry times, or mediate between conflicting claims hold the most influence.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in the Wilds revolves around practical knowledge, local customs, and the ability to provide essential services like navigation, shelter, and supply. Rewards often take the form of tokens, passes, and local knowledge that can be leveraged into greater safety and efficiency. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, knots, passes) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival guides or claimants issue conflicting directions, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the trails, shelters, and crossings as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of local custom determines success.
\end{itemize}
In the Wilds, your skill is your standing, and your standing determines whether you survive or perish.

\subsection*{Fast reskin palette}
\label{sec:wilderness-reskin-palette}
\begin{description}
\item[Forest] swap dunes$\rightarrow$deadfall, spindrift$\rightarrow$canopy flare, prowlers$\rightarrow$boar/wolves; water = spring/stream.
\item[Desert] swap bog$\rightarrow$salt pan, fog$\rightarrow$dust, shelter = overhang/wadi; water = seep/fog net.
\item[Tundra/Ice] swap dune shift$\rightarrow$ice heave, fire$\rightarrow$spindrift, boats$\rightarrow$sleds; prowlers = bears/wolves.

\item[Swamp/Fen] crossings = corduroy/log causeways, bad ground = peat crust, prowlers = gators/leeches.
\item[Highlands] crossings = cols and scree traverses, alarms = beacon chains, prowlers = cats/eagles.
\end{description}


\subsection*{Wilds — Roads and Ruins}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A shelter hollow carved into a fallen giant’s ribcage, moss glowing faintly under starlight.
\begin{quote}
“In the Wilds, the land walks when you don’t watch it, and the roads remember who bled on them.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Shelter Hollow, a Forager Child offers a route-song. ``The Bad Ground shifts,'' they say. ``And the weather walks behind it.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Ruin ivy, singing paths, weather as creature, stone memories.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Cut through the Bad Ground,'' ``Take the relic,'' ``Leave the guide.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Weather Wakes''; Fracture: ``Roads Move''; Community: ``Foragers Vanish.''
\paragraph{Complications} Ruins reassemble; rain falls upward; the child knows tomorrow.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A caravan; a family relic.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The song changes key.
\paragraph{Relief} Sing in harmony; mark a safe path with blood and story; abandon the relic to drop Threat by one.

\subsection*{Travel Procedures (Fast Play)}

\paragraph{Route Intent (declare before you draw)}
Pick \emph{two}: \textbf{Speed}, \textbf{Stealth}, \textbf{Safety}, \textbf{Survey}.  
Each grants +1 Position on one appropriate action this leg; the neglected ones are -1 Position if tested.

\paragraph{March Structure}
Name: \textbf{Pathfinder}, \textbf{Rear Watch}, \textbf{Quartermaster}, \textbf{Envoy}.  
Each can cover one miss per leg by marking a minor cost (supply, time, favor, fatigue).

\paragraph{Leg Resolution (one “day” of travel)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Read Weather:} Roll on Weather Engine (below). Apply tags.
\item \textbf{Waycheck:} One check to \emph{Keep the Old Road} or \emph{Cut a New Line}. Success avoids \emph{Doubleback}. Mixed = \emph{Delay}. Miss = \emph{Route Blocked}.
\item \textbf{Encounter Pull:} If any \emph{Clubs} were drawn to frame this leg, resolve now (prowlers, wardens, alarm).
\item \textbf{Make Camp or Push:} Camp (see Camps \& Watches) or push on (mark 1 \emph{Fatigue} each; if pushing under a \emph{Weather Turn}, mark 2).
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Weather Engine}

\begin{tabular}{p{0.12\textwidth} p{0.26\textwidth} p{0.55\textwidth}}
\textbf{d12} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Tags / Effects} \\
\hline
1 & Glass-Clear & +Survey; mirage/long sight; smoke seen for miles \\
2 & Haze & -Survey; scents carry; \emph{Prowlers Shadow} +1 die \\
3 & Trickle Rain & Tracks muddle; \emph{Bad Ground} more likely \\
4 & Downpour & Paths sluice; +Delay on all exposed tasks \\
5 & Thunderhead & First metal test risks shock; morale checks -1 \\
6 & Cold Snap & Brittle gear; +1 cost to swim/ford tests \\
7 & Heat Snap & Water usage doubled; Exhaustion clocks advance \\
8 & Ground Fog & +Stealth/-Speed; signals/archery downgraded \\
9 & Spindrift / Dust & Ranged beyond close is risky; eyes/filters matter \\
10 & Shifting Wind & Smoke betrays; scent trails reverse mid-leg \\
11 & Front Line & Choose: detour (Delay) or face \emph{Elemental Front} \\
12 & Catspaw Omen & GM may bank 1 SB to twist weather next leg \\
\end{tabular}
\subsection*{Supply \& Forage}

\paragraph{Rations Track}
Each PC holds \textbf{3} marks of food/water abstractly. A leg consumes 1; \emph{Heat/Cold Snap} consumes +1.  
At 0, mark \textbf{Supply Pinch}: -1 die to Strenuous actions; predators test at +1.

\paragraph{Forage/Harvest (once per leg)}
Pick a biome tag (Forest/Desert/Tundra/Coast/Swamp/Highland). On success: +1d3 rations; mixed: +1 with a hitch (quarantine sign, spoor); miss: find nothing and trigger a minor Complication.

\paragraph{Cache Tokens}
Spending \emph{Cache Token} refills 1d3 party rations plus one of: fuel, arrows, spare tack.
\subsection*{Hazards \& Terrain (d8 each)}

\paragraph{Bad Ground (what it is)}
1 sink crust \quad 2 hidden crease \quad 3 old culvert \quad 4 rotten bridge  
5 talus ribbon \quad 6 reed-raft rot \quad 7 thaw-pocket \quad 8 dune slip

\paragraph{Why it bites (on a mixed/miss)}
1 pack animals balk \quad 2 axle snaps \quad 3 someone sinks to hip  
4 detour adds a leg \quad 5 noise carries \quad 6 gear lost \quad 7 trail erases \quad 8 local claims fee

\paragraph{Fix at hand (quirky mitigations)}
1 brush fascines \quad 2 snow shoes \quad 3 driftwood crib \quad 4 rope ferry  
5 sled/drag \quad 6 wait a bell \quad 7 lighten loads \quad 8 bribe the warden
\subsection*{Social in the Wilds}

\paragraph{Trail Rights (custom)}
Show a right-token (knot/bead/bark-sigil) and recite the road-blessing:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Success:} Treat strangers as neighbors for one camp; \emph{Paper vs Spear} downgrades one step.
\item \textbf{Mixed:} Hospitality but with a debt. Mark \textbf{Rescue Debt (2)}.
\item \textbf{Miss:} \emph{Claimant Chief} or \emph{Warden Patrol} contests your right; stakes escalate.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Wardens’ Ledger}
If you offer \emph{Route Song}, local escort negates one \emph{Prowlers Shadow} this leg. Refuse a reasonable toll? Start \textbf{Local Resentment (4)}; when it fills, checkpoints bloom.
\subsection*{Camps \& Watches}

\paragraph{Make Camp}
Pick one boon and one risk:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Boon (choose 1):} mend gear; clear 1 Fatigue total; scout tomorrow’s \emph{Weather Window}; parley with road spirits (see below).
\item \textbf{Risk (choose 1):} thin shelter; smoky fire; exposed approach; hungry neighbors.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Road Spirits (small courtesies)}
Pour water, place pebble, speak a name. Success: bank \emph{Truce Cord} for tomorrow. Miss: \emph{Bad Omen} flags this camp.
\subsection*{Chase \& Pursuit (three beats)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Gap} (terrain claim): runners set advantage via \emph{Lookout Knoll}/\emph{Gate Gully}/\emph{Old Road}.  
\item \textbf{Pressure} (weather claim): winner of \emph{Weather Engine} narration shifts Position.  
\item \textbf{Break} (resource claim): spend \emph{Remount Hire}/\emph{Route Song}/\emph{Warden’s Favor} to end it; otherwise test \emph{Pursuit}. 
\end{enumerate}
On miss at any beat, mark 1 harm or drop 1 load \emph{(your choice)}.
\subsection*{Clocks \& Escalations}

\paragraph{Roads Move (6)}
1–2: Landmarks drift. \quad 3–4: Old Road reroutes through \emph{Gate Gully}. \quad 5: Map contradicts guide. \quad 6: Trail nexus re-knots; choose who benefits.

\paragraph{Weather Wakes (6)}
1–2: Predictable fronts arrive early. \quad 3–4: Elementals ride the line. \quad 5: Two weathers at once. \quad 6: \emph{Catastrophe}; clocks jump.

\paragraph{Local Resentment (4)}
1: Tolls “adjust.” \quad 2–3: Wardens frisk; smugglers sniff profit. \quad 4: \emph{General Alarm}—every track a checkpoint.
\subsection*{Cross-Regional Conversions}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mistlands:} \emph{Weather Window} may count as a \emph{Lantern Writ} on levee crowns if you ring a bell after dark; doing so risks \emph{Witchlight Count}.
\item \textbf{Valewood:} \emph{Route Song} functions as a minor \emph{Way-Cord}; on use, start \textbf{Oath-Magnet (2)}.
\item \textbf{Ubral:} \emph{Warden’s Favor} can be honored as \emph{Guide’s Braid} on sheepwalks if a cairn-offering is made.
\item \textbf{Viterra:} \emph{Toll Waiver} notarized in Valora acts as a one-leg \emph{Ferry Priority}; tick \textbf{Border-Lace}.
\item \textbf{Vhasia:} \emph{Road Commission} is recognized as \emph{Low-Justice} on King’s High Road until the next levy call.
\item \textbf{Silkstrand:} \emph{Right-of-Pass} doubles as a dawn \emph{Bridge Token} if stamped by a bridge bailiff.
\item \textbf{Theona:} \emph{Truce Cord} permits “eight-and-one” crossing on an \emph{Uncounted Bridge}, once.
\item \textbf{Vilikari:} \emph{Water Deed} may be cited as \emph{Wergild Table} credit at a \emph{Mallus Right} court during drought disputes.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Omens \& Sign (d8 each)}

\paragraph{Sky Signs}
1 sun-dog \quad 2 mare’s tails \quad 3 anvil cloud faces the wrong way \quad 4 silent birds  
5 far thunder without storm \quad 6 moon with halo \quad 7 ash scent on clear air \quad 8 stars “shiver”

\paragraph{Ground Signs}
1 cairn with new pebble \quad 2 boot prints that end at rock \quad 3 butchered game left neat  
4 snapped twig at head height \quad 5 ash under wet moss \quad 6 ward-knot cut \quad 7 trail beads on shrub \quad 8 a single coin on a stone
\subsection*{Quick NPC Templates}

\paragraph{Forager Child (Truth Map)}
\emph{Wants:} To trade a route-song for a story.

\emph{Cost:} Promise to return a trinket to a Boundary Row (start a tiny quest).

\paragraph{Hermit-Healer (Weather Eye)}
\emph{Wants:} Someone to fetch a wind-bell from a Signal Height.  
\emph{Leverage:} Turns one \emph{Weather Turn} into a \emph{Weather Window}.  
\emph{Cost:} Accept their foul cordial (mark “Queasy” until dawn).

\emph{Leverage:} \emph{Remount Hire} or \emph{Cache Token} on the spot.  
\emph{Cost:} Put your name on the ledger (start \textbf{Rescue Debt} at 1).
\subsection*{Terrain / Trail Dressing (roll 1–2 per leg)}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ruins Speak:} Old mile-stone hums a date from a forgotten war; +1 die to history, -1 to stealth this leg.
\item \textbf{Beast Parliament:} Ravens, fox, and a boar seem to “confer” at Water Source; approach buys rumor or chase.
\item \textbf{Ghost Cart Ruts:} Ruts glow at dusk and shave time—if you accept a \emph{Supply Pinch} tomorrow.
\item \textbf{Prayer Flags:} Boundary Row flags in the wrong colors; locals may read you as allied or enemy.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Encounter Seeds}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fire on the Height:} A fresh coal at \emph{Signal Height}; lighting it calls help—or enemy levy. Your choice sets which \emph{Clubs} show next scene.
\item \textbf{Gate Gully Tithe:} Two claimants, one pinch-point. They’ll honor \emph{Truce Cord}—if you arbitrate a water deed on the spot.
\item \textbf{Shelter Debt:} The soot in \emph{Shelter Hollow} spells a name you know; leaving a meal clears a future \emph{Supply Pinch}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Designer Hooks (Optional)}

\paragraph{Route-Song Craft}
Spend a scene and 1 \emph{Route Song} scrap to compose a \emph{Songline}: once per journey, skip \emph{Doubleback}. Singing it in public adds 1 tick to \textbf{Local Resentment} (others want it).

\paragraph{Weather-Witchery (Low Magic)}
Offer a token to road spirits during a \emph{Front Line}; on a hit, trade today’s weather for tomorrow’s. On a miss, both happen now at half strength.

\subsection*{Homage Sites \& Lairs (drop-in Terrain)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Border Keep of Candle-Gate} — Stockade on a bluff above twin gullies; cellars link to smugglers’ bolt-holes where ledgers argue with knives.
  \item \textbf{The Bone King’s Barrow} — Hill split by lightning; whispering chute to a throne of antlers where oaths bind the living to the dead.
  \item \textbf{Serpent-Cairns of the Wind Steppe} — Rings of stacked shale; wind plays bone flutes; scale-runes name a forgotten tax on breath.
  \item \textbf{The Blue Glass Tower} — Fallen mage-spire sunk in a fen; panes show tomorrows you can’t reach; water stairs lead to a clockwork aviary.
  \item \textbf{Isle of Thunder-Lizards} — Reef shelf at low tide; drums in the cliffs; eggs warm under black sand that hisses with static.
  \item \textbf{The Amber Idol Dig} — Abandoned worksite with tar pits; half-freed idol drinks lantern-light; foreman’s diary ends mid-apology.
  \item \textbf{Hall of the Stone-Chiefs} — Terrace of toppled colossi; each face wears a different season; a living boulder judges trespass by weight.
  \item \textbf{Salt-Vein Labyrinth} — Collapsed mine whose walls sweat brine; maps dissolve; a blind choir keeps time with pick-hafts.
  \item \textbf{Shrine of the Four Storm Doors} — Weather turns on hinges; choose which door to open and pay its toll in breath, heat, chill, or silence.
  \item \textbf{The Black Lantern Monastery} — Ruin above a fall; lanterns that never burn out reveal tracks made tomorrow; ascetics wrote their sins on river mist.
\end{itemize}
