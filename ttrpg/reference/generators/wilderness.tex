\section{The Wilds --- ``Roads, Ruins, and Weather'' Generator}
\label{chap:wilderness}

\noindent
Between towns and treaties lies the patience of the land. Old roads remember armies; cairns remember names no book keeps. In the Wilds, law thins to trail-marks and favors, and the weather keeps its own counsel. Walk soft, read the wind, and bargain with whatever still listens.

\section*{Spades --- Places (flex to any biome)}
\label{sec:wilderness-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Crossing point (ford/ice-span/stepping logs/dune saddle/reef shelf).
\item Lookout knoll (tor/cliff/dune/ridge) with a wind-carved marker.
\item Old road trace---cairns and switchbacks half-eaten by terrain.
\item Shelter hollow---overhang/cave/root-cellar; soot says ``used lately.''
\item Water source---spring/seep/fog net/snow pan, guarded by thorns or stone.
\item Windbreak---rock ribs/lee of pines/reedwall berm.
\item Ruined outpost---watchstack/wayside shrine/marker pile.
\item Bad ground---sinkhole/bog crust/crevasse/loess slump.
\item Gate gully---a pinch point between bluffs, dunes, or ice hummocks.
\item[J] Boundary row---totems/standing stones/prayer flags bent by weather.
\item[Q] Abandoned worksite---mine/quarry/logging camp/salt pan.
\item[K] Signal height---old fire-pit or mirror stand; smoke stains linger.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (who you meet out here)}

\item Poachers \& trappers who know every snare and shortcut.
\item Hermit-healer with dogs/geese and opinions about weather.
\item Prospectors (salt/amber/iron/fungus) chasing rumors and glint.
\item Roving war-band---reavers or ``escorts,'' depending on your purse.

\item[Q] Quartermaster on inspection---ledgers first, hospitality second.
\item[K] Claimant chief---papers and spears to match.
\item[A] The Stranger---spirit-touched nomad/emissary; rules bend near them.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (re-skin by terrain)}
\label{sec:wilderness-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Weather turn---heat snap/cold snap/fog/dust; plans sag.

\item[J] Pursuit---hunters/avengers follow; signs say ``close.''
\item[Q] Bad omen---will-lights, taboo day, saint bells silent; locals refuse.
\item[K] General alarm---levy/muster/evacuation; all tracks become checkpoints.
\item[A] Catastrophe---flood/whiteout/sandstorm/lahar; clocks jump.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (position changers)}
\label{sec:wilderness-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Cache token---key to a hidden food/fuel stash (once).
\item Right-of-way pass---recognized marker for a named trail or crossing.
\item Warden's favor---escort letter; ``they're with us.''
\item Weather window---good forecast and a narrow gate to use it.
\item Water/fuel deed---lawful draw at a scarce source.
\item Route song / map scrap---navigation advantage that actually works.
\item Remount/boat hire---fresh legs or hulls waiting at a post.
\item Truce cord---taboo exemption at a site (one scene).
\item Toll waiver---ferry/bridge/reef gate honors this chit.
\item[J] Rescue debt---locals owe you (or you them); trade it for labor or intel.
\item[Q] Private audience---keeper/shrine-warden/spirit of place hears you alone.
\item[K] Road-warden commission---temporary authority over a stretch of wilds.
\item[A] Earth's Exception---one temporary rule-bend (cross during storm, pass uncounted, beasts ignore you).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\label{sec:wilderness-features}

\paragraph{Trail Rights}
Some paths are older than borders. Displaying the right token (knot, bead, bark-sigil) turns strangers into neighbors for one campâ€™s length; break the custom and the road forgets you.

\paragraph{Weather-Lore}
Winds carry messages: resin-scent before lightning, a hush before spindrift, birdsong that stops at once. Read them aloud at the table to bias Position before a roll.

\paragraph{Road Spirits}
Shrines at cairns and waystones prefer small courtesies: water poured, a pebble placed, a name spoken. Keep them and the land is kinder; slight them and the land remembers.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:wilderness-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Seed with 4 cards (ensure all four suits): Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes---rights, passes, windows---that change position rather than call for a test.
\item If an A appears, add a lingering omen of the land (a smell on the wind, a sound that carries too far, tracks that shift) you can echo in later scenes.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Fast reskin palette}
\label{sec:wilderness-reskin}
\begin{description}
\item[Forest] swap dunes$\rightarrow$deadfall, spindrift$\rightarrow$canopy flare, prowlers$\rightarrow$boar/wolves; water = spring/stream.
\item[Desert] swap bog$\rightarrow$salt pan, fog$\rightarrow$dust, shelter = overhang/wadi; water = seep/fog net.
\item[Tundra/Ice] swap dune shift$\rightarrow$ice heave, fire$\rightarrow$spindrift, boats$\rightarrow$sleds; prowlers = bears/wolves.
\item[Coast/Isles] crossings = reef shelves, prowlers = seals/raiders, alarms = harbor booms; fuel = driftwood.
\item[Swamp/Fen] crossings = corduroy/log causeways, bad ground = peat crust, prowlers = gators/leeches.
\item[Highlands] crossings = cols and scree traverses, alarms = beacon chains, prowlers = cats/eagles.
