\section{The Wilds --- ``Roads, Ruins, and Weather''}
\label{chap:wilderness}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Between towns and treaties lies the patience of the land. Old roads remember armies; cairns remember names no book keeps. In the Wilds, law thins to trail-marks and favors, and the weather keeps its own counsel. Walk soft, read the wind, and bargain with whatever still listens.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Crossing/Lookout/Old Road)} Crossing point with ford/ice-span/stepping logs; lookout knoll with wind-carved marker; old road trace with cairns half-eaten by terrain.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:wilderness-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (cache/pass/favor) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, add lingering omen of land (smell on wind, sound that carries too far, tracks that shift) you can echo in later scenes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Trail Rights:} Some paths older than borders. Display right token (knot, bead, bark-sigil) turns strangers into neighbors for one camp's length; break custom and road forgets you.
\item \textbf{Weather-Lore:} Winds carry messages: resin-scent before lightning, hush before spindrift, birdsong that stops at once. Read aloud at table to bias Position before roll.
\item \textbf{Road Spirits:} Shrines at cairns and waystones prefer small courtesies: water poured, pebble placed, name spoken. Keep them and land is kinder; slight them and land remembers.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In the Wilds, power flows through knowledge of the land, the ability to navigate without formal authority, and the careful cultivation of local relationships. True authority comes from understanding weather patterns, reading tracks, and maintaining the favor of both human inhabitants and the spirits of place. Those who can provide safe passage, find water in dry times, or mediate between conflicting claims hold the most influence.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in the Wilds revolves around practical knowledge, local customs, and the ability to provide essential services like navigation, shelter, and supply. Rewards often take the form of tokens, passes, and local knowledge that can be leveraged into greater safety and efficiency. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, knots, passes) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival guides or claimants issue conflicting directions, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the trails, shelters, and crossings as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of local custom determines success.
\end{itemize}
In the Wilds, your skill is your standing, and your standing determines whether you survive or perish.
