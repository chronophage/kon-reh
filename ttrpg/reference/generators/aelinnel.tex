\chapter{Aelinnel (Gnomes) --- ``Stone, Bough, and Bright Things'' Generator}

\section*{Spades --- Places (stone spires, sea-rock, deep woods)}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Tide-rift steps cut into black rock; limpets and old votive nails.
\item Moonwell basin in a granite bowl; coins turn green in a week.
\item Dolmen stair up a ridge; each capstone rings if you tap it right.
\item Charcoal coppice under witch-hazel; a neat ash-heap hides a door.
\item Basalt organ cliffs: sea-caves breathe like slow bellows.
\item Stag Road---game-trail marked by antler-posts; hooves know it best.
\item Quartz spring where the sand shines like ground stars.
\item Elf-causey of pale flags through a marsh; visible at dawn and dusk only.
\item Root gallery under an oak hill; lanterns hang from living bark.
\item[J] Barrow gallery with stone chimes and a cold draft from below.
\item[Q] Thorn Court ring---hawthorns trained into arches; petals fall like knife-points.
\item[K] Hall of Aelinnel: a timber keep threaded between standing stones.
\item[A] The Green Gate in a sea-arch; at certain tides it opens to a forest not on any map.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (keepers, courts, craftsmen, hunters)}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Goat-herd of the stone edges---knows every safe hoof-width.
\item Charcoal-burner clan who can read draught and omen by smoke.
\item Hedge-witch with a pocket full of thorns and deals you'll regret.
\item Stone-singer (quarryman) whose hum finds a seam and a secret.
\item Forester-warden with copper nails and a polite dislike of iron.
\item Reed-net fisher who knows when the selkies listen.
\item Oath-carver who sets promises in quartz so they can be seen.
\item Way-keeper of the Stag Road; never lost, often followed.
\item Green-market broker who trades truths for trinkets and back again.
\item[J] Green Knight---antler helm, mirror-bright blade, old courtesy.
\item[Q] Lady of Thorns, sovereign of a hawthorn court; smiles like a snare.
\item[K] Stone Prince of Aelinnel, mortal crown with fae debts properly indexed.
\item[A] Huntsman of the Moonlit Ride; his horn turns shortcuts into roads.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (glamour, geasa, weather, neighbors)}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Glamour fog; time drifts, footfalls don't match.
\item Iron offense---someone brought the wrong nails to the right grove.
\item Root-slide pulls a trail two ridges away while you blink.
\item Wrong tide at the sea-arch; boats rise where mathematics say no.
\item Spoken geas catches on an unlucky word; the task names itself.
\item Green Market price: payment demanded in names and memories.
\item Stone-wight stirs in a barrow; echoes hate company.
\item Lost day---the sun miscounts; your dawn arrives at supper.
\item Thorn blight crawls across orchards; pruners bleed stories.
\item[J] Stag horn sounds; everyone owes the chase---especially you.
\item[Q] Thorn Court tithe levied on the Hall; arrests wear flowers.
\item[K] Muster of the Bough---forest banners rise; travel becomes trespass.
\item[A] Green Gate yawns at the wrong hour; roads rewire across your path.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (charms, passes, host-rights, exceptions)}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Hazel token---step through a hedge uncut, once.
\item Salt license---carry and use ward-salt where it's ``discouraged.''
\item Dolmen carving-right---inscribe a name or claim on a speaking stone.
\item Guest-bough from the Thorn Court---one night's safe table among thorns.
\item Quarry allotment of clear quartz; subtle doors open to its bearer.
\item Green Market voucher---buy a truth at face value (today only).
\item Oath-bead; a spoken promise warms the bead when kept, chills when not.
\item Tide-path key---lawful crossing of a named sea-cave at neap.
\item Forest truce---hunt, cut, or travel through a warded copse without offense.
\item[J] Green Knight escort from ridge to gate; watchers bow, paths part.
\item[Q] Private audience with the Lady of Thorns; a whisper exits as policy.
\item[K] Stone Prince's seal---levies defer, foresters guide, scribes stop arguing.
\item[A] Wild Hunt clemency---ride under the horn for one night; no hound will take you.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until all four suits appear: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (charms/passes/host-rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A shows, echo moonlight-on-stone motifs---antlers in shadow, petals that cut, a tide that breathes---and let a shortcut appear where no road should be.
\end{itemize}
