\section{Aelinnel (Gnomes) --- ``Stone, Bough, and Bright Things''}
\label{chap:aelinnel}

\subsection*{Elite (Stone Prince of Aelinnel)}
\textit{``The law here flows like water over stone – it finds its own path, and woe to those who try to dam it with paper and pretense. The earth itself will testify against the unjust.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Charcoal-burner clan who read draught and omen by smoke)}
\textit{``Our kilns tell us more than your books ever could. When the smoke curls left, the tide's with you. When it splits in three, best stay by your own hearth till it burns straight again.''}


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Stone, Bough, and Bright Things}]
Aelinnel clings to the Dolmis coast beneath the shadow of the Valewood, its halls threaded through granite and hawthorn, its roads counted by antler-posts and moonlit math. Here, promises have weight and numbers have manners. \emph{Even} steps are safe, \emph{odd} words are careful, and truths are traded like copper nails---bright, useful, slightly dangerous in the wrong pocket. The gnomish courts hold two ledgers for every bargain: one for what was said, one for what was meant. Both are binding.

Craft and courtesy govern traffic between fae courts and mortal keeps. Gnomish stone-singers tune bridges with a hum; forester-wardens hammer copper where iron would offend. In markets under living roofs, a sentence can be cut to fit a purse, and a memory can be wrapped for travel. Paths sometimes shorten themselves for those who keep good count, and lengthen for those who sneer at patterns.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Spades --- Places (stone spires, sea-rock, deep woods)}
\label{sec:aelinnel-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item (Tide/Mystery) Tide-rift steps cut into black rock; limpets and old votive nails keep count for those who forget.
\item (Magic/Transformation) Moonwell basin in a granite bowl; coins turn green in a week, names in a season.
\item (Music/Stone) Dolmen stair up a ridge; each capstone rings a different interval if you tap it true.
\item (Magic/Secrecy) Charcoal coppice under witch-hazel; a neat ash-heap hides a door that opens on even knocks only.
\item (Nature/Music) Basalt organ cliffs: sea-caves breathe like slow bellows; the wind prefers prime numbers.
\item (Nature/Tradition) Stag Road---game-trail marked by antler-posts; hooves know it best, maps accept it grudgingly.
\item (Magic/Purity) Quartz spring where the sand shines like ground stars; drinkers tell the same story with better structure.
\item (Fae/Visibility) Elf-causey of pale flags through a marsh; visible at dawn and dusk and whenever someone is counting aloud.
\item (Underground/Living) Root gallery under an oak hill; lanterns hang from living bark---two lit, one listening.
\item[J] (Death/Music) Barrow gallery with stone chimes; a cold draft from below plays scales no throat can sing.
\item[Q] (Fae/Danger) Thorn Court ring---hawthorns trained into arches; petals fall like knife-points and settle into proofs.
\item[K] (Civilization/Magic) Hall of Aelinnel: a timber keep threaded between standing stones; floors level themselves for guests.
\item[A] (Otherworld/Gate) The Green Gate in a sea-arch; at certain tides it opens to a forest not on any map, and expects exact change.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (keepers, courts, craftsmen, hunters)}
\label{sec:aelinnel-people}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item (Practical/Knowledge) Goat-herd of the stone edges---measures danger in hoof-widths; never wrong twice.
\item (Craft/Divination) Charcoal-burner clan who read draught and omen by smoke; their kilns hum in thirds.
\item (Magic/Commerce) Hedge-witch with a pocket of thorns and prices stated in \emph{unlesses}.
\item (Craft/Magic) Stone-singer (quarryman) whose hum finds a seam and a secret; walls relax when they pass.
\item (Nature/Courtesy) Forester-warden with copper nails and a polite dislike of iron; paths obey their hammer.
\item (Nature/Tradition) Reed-net fisher who knows when the selkies listen; mends nets to lullabies in 5s and 8s.
\item (Law/Magic) Oath-carver who sets promises in quartz so they can be seen; breaks none, bends many.
\item (Navigation/Guidance) Way-keeper of the Stag Road; never lost, often followed, sometimes found ahead.
\item (Commerce/Magic) Green-market broker trading truths for trinkets and back again; receipts in leaf-vein script.
\item[J] (Fae/Authority) Green Knight---antler helm, mirror-bright blade, courtesy old as frost; keeps a tally of saved insults.
\item[Q] (Fae/Power) Lady of Thorns, sovereign of a hawthorn court; smiles like a snare and forgives in exact measures.
\item[K] (Authority/Magic) Stone Prince of Aelinnel, mortal crown with fae debts properly indexed and current.
\item[A] (Hunt/Destiny) Huntsman of the Moonlit Ride; his horn turns shortcuts into roads, and debts into destinations.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (glamour, geasa, weather, neighbors)}
\label{sec:aelinnel-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item (Illusion/Disorientation) Glamour fog; time drifts, footfalls don't match, conversations arrive neatly folded.
\item (Offense/Magic) Iron offense---someone brought the wrong nails to the right grove; paths take it personally.
\item (Magic/Displacement) Root-slide pulls a trail two ridges away while you blink; your footprints stay where they were.
\item (Magic/Physics) Wrong tide at the sea-arch; boats rise where arithmetic says no and physics excuses itself.
\item (Magic/Binding) Spoken geas catches on an unlucky word; the task names itself and refuses synonyms.
\item (Commerce/Magic) Green Market price: payment demanded in names and memories; change returned in riddles.
\item (Death/Complaint) Stone-wight stirs in a barrow; echoes hate company and file complaints as drafts.
\item (Time/Magic) Lost day---the sun miscounts; your dawn arrives at supper and demands bread.
\item (Nature/Curse) Thorn blight crawls across orchards; pruners bleed stories that grow where they drip.
\item[J] (Hunt/Duty) Stag horn sounds; everyone owes the chase---especially you, especially now.
\item[Q] (Fae/Law) Thorn Court tithe levied on the Hall; arrests wear flowers and quote etiquette.
\item[K] (Nature/Conflict) Muster of the Bough---forest banners rise; travel becomes trespass by default.
\item[A] (Otherworld/Logic) Green Gate yawns at the wrong hour; roads rewire across your path with excellent logic.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (charms, passes, host-rights, exceptions)}
\label{sec:aelinnel-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item (Magic/Protection) Hazel token---step through a hedge uncut, once; the scratch you did not get will \emph{remember} you kindly.
\item (Utility/Rebellion) Salt license---carry and use ward-salt where it's discouraged; doors frown and open anyway.
\item (Magic/Authority) Dolmen carving-right---inscribe a name or claim on a speaking stone; arguments quiet while you carve.
\item (Hospitality/Fae) Guest-bough from the Thorn Court---one night's safe table among thorns; knives behave.
\item (Magic/Access) Quarry allotment of clear quartz; subtle doors open to its bearer if asked in the right tense.
\item (Commerce/Magic) Green Market voucher---buy a truth at face value (today only); tomorrow costs interest.
\item (Magic/Binding) Oath-bead; a spoken promise warms the bead when kept, chills when not, glows if misunderstood.
\item (Travel/Magic) Tide-path key---lawful crossing of a named sea-cave at neap; the cave will wait.
\item (Nature/Permission) Forest truce---hunt, cut, or travel through a warded copse without offense; the birds file no reports.
\item[J] (Protection/Fae) Green Knight escort from ridge to gate; watchers bow, paths part, insults lodge elsewhere.
\item[Q] (Fae/Authority) Private audience with the Lady of Thorns; a whisper exits as policy with petals attached.
\item[K] (Authority/Magic) Stone Prince's seal---levies defer, foresters guide, scribes stop arguing and fetch tea.
\item[A] (Hunt/Protection) Wild Hunt clemency---ride under the horn for one night; no hound will take you, no debt will sleep.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:aelinnel-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until all four suits appear: \textbf{Spade} = place, \textbf{Heart} = actor, \textbf{Club} = pressure, \textbf{Diamond} = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Treat \textbf{Diamonds} as codified outcomes (charms/passes/host-rights) that \emph{change position} rather than call for a roll.
\item If any \textbf{A} appears, echo moonlight-on-stone and tidy-logic motifs---antlers in shadow, petals that cut, a tide that breathes, and a shortcut that insists on proper counting.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Counting Etiquette:} Once per scene, any character who carefully counts (steps, breaths, beads, stitches) may shift \emph{Position} one step safer for the next action that exploits pattern or timing.
\item \textbf{Copper over Iron:} When the party visibly favors copper/brass tools over iron in fae-facing scenes, gain +1 assist die from locals (or avoid a -1 penalty) for acts of courtesy, passage, or petition.
\item \textbf{Spoken Maths:} Reciting a simple sequence (2-3-5-8...) in tense moments steadies the scene: cancel the first SB generated by a navigation or negotiation misstep this encounter.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Courtesies of the Green Gate}]
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Never bring iron} past a hawthorn arch unless it is gilded or named. Copper is polite, silver is opinionated.
\item \textbf{Always return what points the way.} Way-cords, antler-posts, chalk. Borrow the path; do not keep it.
\item \textbf{Speak debts in the daylight.} Promises made under lantern-boughs are heard by leaves as well as by law.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Numbers \& Nature}]
In Aelinnel, the boundary between mathematics and magic blurs like morning mist. The gnomes understand that numbers are not merely tools for calculation but the underlying rhythm of reality itself. Their courtesy is mathematical---a precise exchange of value, a careful balance of obligation and favor. To offend their sense of order is to invite the world's correction; to honor it is to find that paths open, doors speak, and even the stones themselves become allies. The fae courts they traffic with recognize this respect for pattern and respond in kind, creating a delicate dance of mutual benefit and barely-contained chaos.

\section*{Thematic SB Spend Table}
\label{sec:thematic-sb}

\subsection*{Minor Complications (1 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Exposure:} Your actions draw unwanted attention from [local authority/creature/faction]
\item \textbf{Noise:} Sounds of your actions alert nearby [enemies/critters/locals]
\item \textbf{Trace:} Evidence of your passage marks your route for trackers/followers
\item \textbf{Delay:} A brief but meaningful setback costs you [time/resources/opportunity]
\item \textbf{Supply Strain:} Mark +1 segment on a relevant resource clock
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Moderate Setbacks (2 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Alarm Raised:} [Local authority/faction] becomes aware and begins responding
\item \textbf{Position Lost:} You lose advantageous ground/cover/stealth
\item \textbf{Foe Appears:} A [minor threat/rival/enemy] arrives on scene
\item \textbf{Gear Trouble:} A piece of equipment becomes [Compromised/Neglected]
\item \textbf{Lock/Barrier:} A simple obstacle now requires a test to overcome
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Serious Trouble (3 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reinforcements:} Additional [enemies/allies of enemies] arrive
\item \textbf{Key Gear Breaks:} A crucial tool/weapon becomes temporarily unusable
\item \textbf{Major Twist:} The situation fundamentally changes - [trap springs/route blocked/ally turns]
\item \textbf{Rail Tick:} Advance a relevant campaign/front clock by 1 segment
\item \textbf{Condition Applied:} Mark [Fatigue 1/Harm 1/Condition] appropriate to fiction
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Trap Springs:} A prepared danger activates with full effect
\item \textbf{Authority Arrival:} [Major local power/leader/faction] intervenes
\item \textbf{Scene Shift:} The environment changes dramatically - [fire spreads/floor collapses/storm hits]
\item \textbf{Patron Omen:} Divine/arcane forces take notice - [omen appears/blessing lost/curse manifests]
\item \textbf{Narrative Pivot:} The story takes an unexpected turn that reframes objectives
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Region-Specific SB Options}
Each region generator should include 2-3 custom SB spends that reflect its unique themes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Aelinnel (Numbers \& Magic):} Antler-posts rearrange themselves, petals cut like blades, moonlight reveals hidden paths
\item \textbf{Aelinnel (Fae Courtesy):} A hawthorn arch closes behind you, copper tools glow with fae attention, polite phrases become binding contracts
\item \textbf{Aelinnel (Glamour):} Conversations arrive folded and misaddressed, time drifts unexpectedly, footfalls don't match your steps
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Aelinnel — Tidal Bargains}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A tide‑shed at dawn, fog curling over anchored barges, while gulls cry omens over the river’s black glass.
\begin{quote}
"In Aelinnel lands, the river speaks with many tongues, and each tide demands a name in return.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A tide-shed at dawn, a gnomish reeve offers passage on a sealed barge. ``The Green Gate opens at neap tide. What we trade there, the Dolmis will not name.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Tide-ledgers, river gods, sealed cargo, name-taboo.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Peek in the crate,'' ``Speak the hidden name,'' ``Break quarantine.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Green Gate Thirst''; Community: ``Dockside Fear''; Anchor: ``Barge Oath.''
\paragraph{Complications} Freshwater turns brackish; the cargo sings; a rival reeve boards with knives.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A PC’s river-kin; the barge’s blessing.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The Gate opens early; the tide runs backwards.
\paragraph{Relief} Offer a river-gift; carry a name written in river-mud across the threshold; spend 2 \Boons{} to seal the leak for a scene.

% ====== EXTENSIONS ======

\subsection*{Faction Entanglements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Stone–Singer Conclave:} Sponsor a bridge-chant or way-tuning and bank a \emph{Harmonic Favor}—spend to shift \emph{Position} one step safer on any passage across worked stone or living root. Skip their rites and the first crossing this leg gains a free “Lock/Barrier” SB as paths sulk.
  \item \textbf{Forester–Wardens:} Accept copper-nail protocols to cancel the first \emph{Fae Offense} SB in a wood scene. Drive iron stakes or break taboo and mark a 4-segment \emph{Polite Apology} clock you must clear before locals assist you again.
  \item \textbf{Green-Market Brokers:} Submit an itemized truth (what was said / what was meant) to reduce barter DV by 1 for the scene. Try to haggle on single-ledger terms, and the market tags you with \emph{Exact Change Only}—all bargains hereafter demand a tithe of memory or name until appeased.
  \item \textbf{Oath–Carvers’ Guild:} Have a promise set in quartz to gain a \emph{Visible Oath} token; spend to treat one social test as if aided by a reputable witness. Breaking a quartz-oath spawns a 4-segment \emph{Shattered Nuance} clock that complicates future negotiations.
  \item \textbf{Tide–Reeves:} File a tide-plan before neap to earn a \emph{Tide Window}—ignore one tidal timing penalty this leg. Skipping the ledger adds a free “Wrong Tide” SB the first time you touch the Dolmis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cross–Regional Ties \& Soft Power}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Way of Silk Interface:} Kon’reh-counted caravans that adopt Aelinnel step-metrics (even steps, counted halts) gain +1 die to avoid ambushes on the Way this arc. Breaking count invites a free “Glamour Fog” SB at the next way-shrine.
  \item \textbf{Aeler Standards (Rods \& Wards):} Recognize Aeler measures publicly to reduce dispute DV by 1 with dwarven legates; insist on gnomish dual-ledger and foreign merchants grumble—first mixed-market scene gains an “Assay Doubt” SB.
  \item \textbf{Vhasia/Viterra Complications:} Vhasian hedge-duties (wood rites) and Viterra tithe-scripts (grain flows) cross your ledgers. When either region is “Stressed,” add +1 DV to Green-Market exports that travel their roads unless you carry a \emph{Forest Truce} or \emph{Tithe Waiver}.
  \item \textbf{Valewood Fallout:} On a \emph{Valewood Weather} signal, fae proofs spill downslope; counting etiquette cancels the first navigation SB each scene, but any iron shown gains a free “Fae Complaint” SB (even among humans). Aelaerem hospitality rites mitigate this: presenting guest-loaf removes one such complaint per hall.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Trade Goods \& Consequences}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Quartz \& Proof–Stone:} Donate clear quartz to a shrine to bank a \emph{Seen Promise}—once, treat a murky contract as if properly witnessed. Peddle clouded quartz as “ritual grade” and spawn a roaming \emph{Counterfeit Proof} inquiry clock.
  \item \textbf{Copper Etiquette Kits:} Issuing copper over iron in mixed courts grants +1 assist die on petitions; flooding markets with cheap copper pins offends foresters—add a “Copper Resentment” tag that raises DV in wood jurisdictions until you make amends.
  \item \textbf{Name–Script \& Memory Wraps:} Legal export of name-script lowers espionage DV by 1 for allies who carry it. Smuggling wraps risks a \emph{Name-Tax}—first customs scene converts 1 SB into a compelled disclosure.
  \item \textbf{Tide Rights \& Barge Seals:} Funding barge-seals creates a \emph{Waiting Cave}—once per arc the cave “waits” an extra beat for your crew. Ignoring seal-maintenance flips it: first Dolmis crossing suffers “Wrong Hour” SB.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Patron Networks (Patterns \& Thresholds)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Sacred Geometry:} Chalk a golden-mean spiral at a ford to reroll one failed prediction/trajectory check this leg; doing so in view of fae courts adds a 2-segment \emph{Proof Envied} clock.
  \item \textbf{The Sealed Gate:} Hawthorn-gilded door-nails act as single-use stay writs: negate one forced entry or pursuit at a hedge-gate.
  \item \textbf{Lunara:} Counting under moonlight lets you ask one terse yes/no about a hidden path; on a Miss, secrets spread—mark Exposure +1 in the nearest Green Market.
  \item \textbf{The Traveler:} Antler-posts double as wayshrines; leave a copper and recite a sequence to finish one travel clock tick for free on forest legs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Field Procedures (Use At the Table)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Two–Ledger Talk:} When parley stalls, the GM asks: “What was said? What was meant?” If players state both, cancel the first social SB this scene; if they refuse, the next bargain demands collateral (memory/name).
  \item \textbf{Count or Be Counted:} At any fae-touched crossing, a player who audibly counts in a fitting sequence shifts \emph{Position} one step safer for that crossing. Boasting or mocking numbers adds a free “Geas Catches” SB.
  \item \textbf{Copper Courtesy Check:} Producing copper/brass tools in a ritual space removes the first \emph{Fae Offense} tag this scene; drawing iron instead escalates the next Complication by +1 Cap.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Diplomatic Favor \& Reputation Echoes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Hazel Favors (minor resource):} Earned by returning way-cords, restoring antler posts, or paying tide-dues. Spend to downgrade a \emph{Glamour} or \emph{Geas} complication once per leg.
  \item \textbf{Marks \& Masks:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \emph{Thorn-Courteous:} Doors of the hawthorn courts open a step easier; human clerks distrust your clauses (first city office DV +1).
      \item \emph{Market-Square:} Brokers vouch your weights; rival stalls circulate riddled slander—add a trailing \emph{Folded Rumor} clock.
      \item \emph{Forester-Trusted:} Paths shorten for you once per journey; port inspectors assume concealed copper—first harbor search gains a free “Alarm Raised” SB unless declared up front.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
