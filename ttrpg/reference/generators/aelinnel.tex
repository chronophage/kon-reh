\section{Aelinnel (Gnomes) --- ``Stone, Bough, and Bright Things''}
\label{chap:aelinnel}

Aelinnel clings to the Dolmis coast beneath the shadow of the Valewood, its halls threaded through granite and hawthorn, its roads counted by antler-posts and moonlit math. Here, promises have weight and numbers have manners. \emph{Even} steps are safe, \emph{odd} words are careful, and truths are traded like copper nails---bright, useful, slightly dangerous in the wrong pocket. The gnomish courts hold two ledgers for every bargain: one for what was said, one for what was meant. Both are binding.

Craft and courtesy govern traffic between \index{Faekin!Aelinnel} fae courts and mortal keeps. Gnomish stone-singers tune bridges with a hum; forester-wardens hammer copper where iron would offend. In markets under living roofs, a sentence can be cut to fit a purse, and a memory can be wrapped for travel. Paths sometimes shorten themselves for those who keep good count, and lengthen for those who sneer at patterns.

\paragraph{Counting \& Courtesy.} In Aelinnel, number is etiquette. Sevens invite; nines trespass; twelves conclude. Tally your steps aloud on a strange stair, never swallow the last digit of a deal, and pay the road with a pebble of the right weight. Those who move to a different beat are not corrected---they are offered a parallel lane, a green-flagged causey that meets the rest at a clean angle.

\begin{sidebar}{Courtesies of the Green Gate}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Never bring iron} past a hawthorn arch unless it is gilded or named. Copper is polite, silver is opinionated.
\item \textbf{Always return what points the way.} Way-cords, antler-posts, chalk. Borrow the path; do not keep it.
\item \textbf{Speak debts in the daylight.} Promises made under lantern-boughs are heard by leaves as well as by law.
\end{itemize}
\end{sidebar}

\section{Spades --- Places (stone spires, sea-rock, deep woods)}
\label{sec:aelinnel-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Tide-rift steps cut into black rock; limpets and old votive nails keep count for those who forget.
\item Moonwell basin in a granite bowl; coins turn green in a week, names in a season.
\item Dolmen stair up a ridge; each capstone rings a different interval if you tap it true.
\item Charcoal coppice under witch-hazel; a neat ash-heap hides a door that opens on even knocks only.
\item Basalt organ cliffs: sea-caves breathe like slow bellows; the wind prefers prime numbers.
\item Stag Road---game-trail marked by antler-posts; hooves know it best, maps accept it grudgingly.
\item Quartz spring where the sand shines like ground stars; drinkers tell the same story with better structure.
\item Elf-causey of pale flags through a marsh; visible at dawn and dusk and whenever someone is counting aloud.
\item Root gallery under an oak hill; lanterns hang from living bark---two lit, one listening.
\item[J] Barrow gallery with stone chimes; a cold draft from below plays scales no throat can sing.
\item[Q] Thorn Court ring---hawthorns trained into arches; petals fall like knife-points and settle into proofs.
\item[K] Hall of Aelinnel: a timber keep threaded between standing stones; floors level themselves for guests.
\item[A] The Green Gate in a sea-arch; at certain tides it opens to a forest not on any map, and expects exact change.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hearts --- People \& Factions (keepers, courts, craftsmen, hunters)}
\label{sec:aelinnel-people}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Goat-herd of the stone edges---measures danger in hoof-widths; never wrong twice.
\item Charcoal-burner clan who read draught and omen by smoke; their kilns hum in thirds.
\item Hedge-witch with a pocket of thorns and prices stated in \emph{unlesses}.
\item Stone-singer (quarryman) whose hum finds a seam and a secret; walls relax when they pass.
\item Forester-warden with copper nails and a polite dislike of iron; paths obey their hammer.
\item Reed-net fisher who knows when the selkies listen; mends nets to lullabies in 5s and 8s.
\item Oath-carver who sets promises in quartz so they can be seen; breaks none, bends many.
\item Way-keeper of the Stag Road; never lost, often followed, sometimes found ahead.
\item Green-market broker trading truths for trinkets and back again; receipts in leaf-vein script.
\item[J] Green Knight---antler helm, mirror-bright blade, courtesy old as frost; keeps a tally of saved insults.
\item[Q] Lady of Thorns, sovereign of a hawthorn court; smiles like a snare and forgives in exact measures.
\item[K] Stone Prince of Aelinnel, mortal crown with fae debts properly indexed and current.
\item[A] Huntsman of the Moonlit Ride; his horn turns shortcuts into roads, and debts into destinations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (glamour, geasa, weather, neighbors)}
\label{sec:aelinnel-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Glamour fog; time drifts, footfalls don't match, conversations arrive neatly folded.
\item Iron offense---someone brought the wrong nails to the right grove; paths take it personally.
\item Root-slide pulls a trail two ridges away while you blink; your footprints stay where they were.
\item Wrong tide at the sea-arch; boats rise where arithmetic says no and physics excuses itself.
\item Spoken geas catches on an unlucky word; the task names itself and refuses synonyms.
\item Green Market price: payment demanded in names and memories; change returned in riddles.
\item Stone-wight stirs in a barrow; echoes hate company and file complaints as drafts.
\item Lost day---the sun miscounts; your dawn arrives at supper and demands bread.
\item Thorn blight crawls across orchards; pruners bleed stories that grow where they drip.
\item[J] Stag horn sounds; everyone owes the chase---especially you, especially now.
\item[Q] Thorn Court tithe levied on the Hall; arrests wear flowers and quote etiquette.
\item[K] Muster of the Bough---forest banners rise; travel becomes trespass by default.
\item[A] Green Gate yawns at the wrong hour; roads rewire across your path with excellent logic.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (charms, passes, host-rights, exceptions)}
\label{sec:aelinnel-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Hazel token---step through a hedge uncut, once; the scratch you did not get will \emph{remember} you kindly.
\item Salt license---carry and use ward-salt where it's discouraged; doors frown and open anyway.
\item Dolmen carving-right---inscribe a name or claim on a speaking stone; arguments quiet while you carve.
\item Guest-bough from the Thorn Court---one night's safe table among thorns; knives behave.
\item Quarry allotment of clear quartz; subtle doors open to its bearer if asked in the right tense.
\item Green Market voucher---buy a truth at face value (today only); tomorrow costs interest.
\item Oath-bead; a spoken promise warms the bead when kept, chills when not, glows if misunderstood.
\item Tide-path key---lawful crossing of a named sea-cave at neap; the cave will wait.
\item Forest truce---hunt, cut, or travel through a warded copse without offense; the birds file no reports.
\item[J] Green Knight escort from ridge to gate; watchers bow, paths part, insults lodge elsewhere.
\item[Q] Private audience with the Lady of Thorns; a whisper exits as policy with petals attached.
\item[K] Stone Prince's seal---levies defer, foresters guide, scribes stop arguing and fetch tea.
\item[A] Wild Hunt clemency---ride under the horn for one night; no hound will take you, no debt will sleep.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:aelinnel-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until all four suits appear: \textbf{Spade} = place, \textbf{Heart} = actor, \textbf{Club} = pressure, \textbf{Diamond} = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Treat \textbf{Diamonds} as codified outcomes (charms/passes/host-rights) that \emph{change position} rather than call for a roll.
\item If any \textbf{A} appears, echo moonlight-on-stone and tidy-logic motifs---antlers in shadow, petals that cut, a tide that breathes, and a shortcut that insists on proper counting.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Counting Etiquette:} Once per scene, any character who carefully counts (steps, breaths, beads, stitches) may shift \emph{Position} one step safer for the next action that exploits pattern or timing.
\item \textbf{Copper over Iron:} When the party visibly favors copper/brass tools over iron in fae-facing scenes, gain +1 assist die from locals (or avoid a -1 penalty) for acts of courtesy, passage, or petition.
\item \textbf{Spoken Maths:} Reciting a simple sequence (2-3-5-8...) in tense moments steadies the scene: cancel the first SB generated by a navigation or negotiation misstep this encounter.
