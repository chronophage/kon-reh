\section{Linn --- ``Skerries \& Storm-Oaths'' Generator}
\label{chap:linn}

North of the Aberderrin Sea, where fjords split the coast and skerries break the tide, dwell the Linn. They are traders and raiders in equal breath, their longships crowding the whale-road and river mouths. They descend the Ylolka like an axe-blade and cut into southern shores, or slip through the Thin Strip where the Valewood dares not touch salt. Yet even these storm-oath people dread the Mistlands and the Valewood, whose fog and trees have no need of ships or harbors to claim their due.

\section*{Spades --- Places (fjords, skerries, halls, mistland routes)}
\label{sec:linn-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Kelp-skerry gut: a narrow channel where oars scrape weed and rock.
\item Tide-shed of longship houses; tar smoke and gulls for sentries.
\item Wave-gate reef just off a raiding beach; only locals know the cut.
\item Runestone causey across a tidal flat; names half lost to barnacle.
\item Herring-stairs drying racks above a cliff path; knives flicker like fish.
\item Winter hall: turf walls, smoke-eye roof, benches crowded with shields.
\item Mistlands reed-maze where channels braid and vanish.
\item Boomed harbor with iron rings set in whale-bone posts.
\item Aberderrin current rips past a headland; wreck timbers salt the kelp.
\item[J] Dolmis waystation on a low isle; fresh water, old debts.
\item[Q] Thing-holm---a flat islet ringed with stones for speaking and swearing.
\item[K] High Jarl's seat above a fjord, beacon tower glaring out to sea.
\item[A] Whale-road horizon---open water where storms are born and names are made.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (jarls, oar-crews, keepers, law)}
\label{sec:linn-people}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Net-wife who reads the sea like a ledger and the sky like a mood.
\item Steersman whose tiller-hand never shakes, even when the keel does.
\item Shipwright with pitch on his palms and a schedule in his teeth.
\item Oar-master who sets the beat that decides if home is today or never.
\item Mist-pilot (reed-runner) who ghosts boats through the marsh lanes.
\item Skald whose verses buy silence, start fights, and end them.
\item Shield-band of cousins: fine with coin, better with cattle.
\item Foster-son from a southern coast; speaks both laws and all the subtext.
\item Thing-speaker who can make a war into a lawsuit and a lawsuit into lunch.
\item[J] Sea-queen's hand---her envoy with a seal-bag and a sword-belt.
\item[Q] Sea-Queen of the Linn, crown of hammered silver, eyes for weather and law.
\item[K] High Jarl over the Strands, first among raids, last to boast.
\item[A] Volva of the Mist, oath-reader whose nod can still the surf.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (weather, reefs, feud, pursuit)}
\label{sec:linn-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Black squall drops out of a clear band; oars or prayers---pick one.
\item Fogfall---sound travels, sight does not; friend and reef trade places.
\item Chain up!---a boom lifts across a target harbor; schedules drown.
\item Levy clash---Viterra's river-wardens arrive with polite spears.
\item Keel-rot rumor sends crews to the beach mid-voyage.
\item Feud token laid on a board; your raid is now a wedding... or a funeral.
\item Oath recalled---a verse you swore last winter matures today.
\item Mistlands miscount: channels ``move,'' cargo disappears without witnesses.
\item Aberderrin race---contrary currents split the flotilla; half are late, half are lost.
\item[J] Southron fire-pots on a quay; night-run turns to day-light.
\item[Q] Thing injunction---no sailing until a grievance is heard (hours? days?).
\item[K] General muster: horns on every headland; all bays become spears.
\item[A] Ground-sea (long, blind swell) rolls under you; steering lies.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (rights, tokens, escorts, priority)}
\label{sec:linn-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Harbor-green mark---dock without levy in a named strand (once).
\item Oar-share---claim two benches on a fast longship for a season.
\item Pilot's token---a mist-runner guides you through the reed-maze.
\item Wharf-right at a Dolmis waystation; your boats load first.
\item Salvage claim on a reef stretch; flotsam is now ``inventory.''
\item Thing ruling---a verdict in your favor that travels with you.
\item Raid-truce ribbon---immunity in a named bay for one market day.
\item Foster-bond---be recognized as guest-kin by a jarl's house.
\item Herring allotment---priority barrels when the run hits.
\item[J] Escort writ---eight shields and a wolf-banner from cape to cape.
\item[Q] Private audience with the Sea-Queen; a whisper exits as policy.
\item[K] High Jarl's pennon---levies open booms and mouths when it flies.
\item[A] Storm-oath clause---one temporary exception to any local sea-law, spoken and sealed.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick Use Notes}
\label{sec:linn-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (rights/tokens/escorts) that shift position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo sea-omens---horns on wind, white horses on the swell, a verse unfinished until landfall.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Storm-Oaths:} Every raid or voyage is sealed by an oath to sea or storm. To break one is to invite the sea itself to judge you.
\item \textbf{Skald’s Burden:} A skald’s verses are law, history, and curse. A poorly chosen rhyme can damn a crew as surely as a reef.
\item \textbf{Mist-Dread:} The bravest Linns will not enter the Direwood’s breath or the Valewood’s shade. Even their Sea-Queen is said to pale at mention of the Ninth Bell of the Mistlands.
\end{itemize}
