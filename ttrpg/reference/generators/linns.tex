\section{Linn --- ``Skerries \& Storm-Oaths''}
\label{chap:linn}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
North of the Aberderrin Sea, where fjords split the coast and skerries break the tide, dwell the Linn. They are traders and raiders in equal breath, their longships crowding the whale-road and river mouths. They descend the Ylolka like an axe-blade and cut into southern shores, or slip through the Thin Strip where the Valewood dares not touch salt. Yet even these storm-oath people dread the Mistlands and the Valewood, whose fog and trees have no need of ships or harbors to claim their due.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Fjord/Skerry/Hall)} Kelp-skerry gut: a narrow channel where oars scrape weed and rock; tide-shed of longship houses with tar smoke and gulls for sentries.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:linn-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (rights/tokens/escorts) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{sea-omens}---horns on wind, white horses on swell, verse unfinished until landfall.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Storm-Oaths:} Every raid or voyage sealed by oath to sea/storm. Break one, invite sea's judgment.
\item \textbf{Skald's Burden:} Verses are law, history, curse. Poor rhyme can damn crew as surely as reef.
\item \textbf{Mist-Dread:} Bravest Linns won't enter Direwood's breath or Valewood's shade. Even Sea-Queen pales at Ninth Bell of Mistlands.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
Among the Linn, power flows through oaths, kinship, and the spoken word. Jarls maintain authority through successful raids and wise judgments, while skalds wield influence through their ability to immortalize deeds in verse---or damn names through satire. The Sea-Queen holds sway over the coastlands, but her rule depends on the respect of the High Jarl and the Thing-speakers who interpret ancient laws. 

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Power in Linn society is fluid and performance-based. Patronage often takes the form of foster-bonds, oar-shares, or raid-truces---each binding the recipient to service and reputation. To emphasize this:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, banners, verses) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
    \item Let rival jarls issue conflicting claims, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
    \item Use the Thing-holm and harbor gatherings as arenas for social contests, where oaths are sworn and broken.
    \end{itemize}
    In Linn society, your word is your bond, and your reputation is your greatest treasure.

    \subsection*{Linn — Skerry Stormcall}
    \textbf{Starting Location:} A longship house lined with storm‑charms and whale‑bone runes, salt wind clawing at the doors.
    \begin{quote}
    “In Linn, storms remember names, and the sea never forgives those who drown unwilling.”
    \end{quote}

    \textbf{In…} A longship house, a Net-Wife binds a storm-token into a PC’s palm. ``The Whale-Road sings,'' she says. ``But the Mistlands whistle back.''

\paragraph{Complications} Nets pull memories; the token grows cold; gulls spell runes.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A boathouse elder; the keel of an ancestor ship.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The tide comes in on both sides of the pier.
\paragraph{Relief} Cast the token into a whirl; sing the loss back; accept a sea-mark scar to drop Fracture by one.

\end{itemize}
