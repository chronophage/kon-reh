\chapter{Linn --- ``Skerries \& Storm-Oaths'' Generator}

\section*{Spades --- Places (fjords, skerries, halls, mistland routes)}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Kelp-skerry gut: a narrow channel where oars scrape weed and rock.
\item Tide-shed of longship houses; tar smoke and gulls for sentries.
\item Wave-gate reef just off a raiding beach; only locals know the cut.
\item Runestone causey across a tidal flat; names half lost to barnacle.
\item Herring-stairs drying racks above a cliff path; knives flicker like fish.
\item Winter hall: turf walls, smoke-eye roof, benches crowded with shields.
\item Mistlands reed-maze where channels braid and vanish.
\item Boomed harbor with iron rings set in whale-bone posts.
\item Aberderrin current rips past a headland; wreck timbers salt the kelp.
\item[J] Dolmis waystation on a low isle; fresh water, old debts.
\item[Q] Thing-holm---a flat islet ringed with stones for speaking and swearing.
\item[K] High Jarl's seat above a fjord, beacon tower glaring out to sea.
\item[A] Whale-road horizon---open water where storms are born and names are made.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (jarls, oar-crews, keepers, law)}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Net-wife who reads the sea like a ledger and the sky like a mood.
\item Steersman whose tiller-hand never shakes, even when the keel does.
\item Shipwright with pitch on his palms and a schedule in his teeth.
\item Oar-master who sets the beat that decides if home is today or never.
\item Mist-pilot (reed-runner) who ghosts boats through the marsh lanes.
\item Skald whose verses buy silence, start fights, and end them.
\item Shield-band of cousins: fine with coin, better with cattle.
\item Foster-son from a southern coast; speaks both laws and all the subtext.
\item Thing-speaker who can make a war into a lawsuit and a lawsuit into lunch.
\item[J] Sea-queen's hand---her envoy with a seal-bag and a sword-belt.
\item[Q] Sea-Queen of the Linn, crown of hammered silver, eyes for weather and law.
\item[K] High Jarl over the Strands, first among raids, last to boast.
\item[A] Volva of the Mist, oath-reader whose nod can still the surf.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (weather, reefs, feud, pursuit)}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Black squall drops out of a clear band; oars or prayers---pick one.
\item Fogfall---sound travels, sight does not; friend and reef trade places.
\item Chain up!---a boom lifts across a target harbor; schedules drown.
\item Levy clash---Viterra's river-wardens arrive with polite spears.
\item Keel-rot rumor sends crews to the beach mid-voyage.
\item Feud token laid on a board; your raid is now a wedding... or a funeral.
\item Oath recalled---a verse you swore last winter matures today.
\item Mistlands miscount: channels ``move,'' cargo disappears without witnesses.
\item Aberderrin race---contrary currents split the flotilla; half are late, half are lost.
\item[J] Southron fire-pots on a quay; night-run turns to day-light.
\item[Q] Thing injunction---no sailing until a grievance is heard (hours? days?).
\item[K] General muster: horns on every headland; all bays become spears.
\item[A] Ground-sea (long, blind swell) rolls under you; steering lies.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (rights, tokens, escorts, priority)}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Harbor-green mark---dock without levy in a named strand (once).
\item Oar-share---claim two benches on a fast longship for a season.
\item Pilot's token---a mist-runner guides you through the reed-maze.
\item Wharf-right at a Dolmis waystation; your boats load first.
\item Salvage claim on a reef stretch; flotsam is now ``inventory.''
\item Thing ruling---a verdict in your favor that travels with you.
\item Raid-truce ribbon---immunity in a named bay for one market day.
\item Foster-bond---be recognized as guest-kin by a jarl's house.
\item Herring allotment---priority barrels when the run hits.
\item[J] Escort writ---eight shields and a wolf-banner from cape to cape.
\item[Q] Private audience with the Sea-Queen; a whisper exits as policy.
\item[K] High Jarl's pennon---levies open booms and mouths when it flies.
\item[A] Storm-oath clause---one temporary exception to any local sea-law, spoken and sealed.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (rights/tokens/escorts) that shift position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo sea-omens---horns on wind, white horses on the swell, a verse unfinished until landfall.
\end{itemize}
