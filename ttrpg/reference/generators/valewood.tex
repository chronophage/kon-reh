\section{Valewood --- ``Empire Under Leaves'' Generator}
\label{chap:valewood}

The Valewood is older than kingdoms, older than the maps that skirt its borders. Beneath its canopy lie the bones of a Lethai empire whose name is forgotten, its towers swallowed by vine and root, its star-roads cracked and phasing between worlds. The air here hums with half-remembered songs of magic, and the ruins bleed their mysteries into root and stream. Fae courts linger in clearings that shift with moonlight, beast-kin patrol moss-choked cairns, and echoes of imperial shades still march patrols on vanished streets. To walk the Valewood is to risk being claimed by it: as guest, prey, heirâ€”or trespasser.

\subsection*{Spades --- Places (phasing ruins, star-roads, living stone)}
\label{sec:valewood-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Star-road shard---pale flagstones that hum when trod in sequence.
\item Rooted amphitheatre; moss-seats remember speeches not yet given.
\item Moon-cistern reflecting a sky that isn't tonight's.
\item Glyphed bridge across a dry stream; glyphs glow when lies pass.
\item Glassleaf gallery---boughs grown into panes, dust like constellations.
\item Hollow aqueduct---water runs uphill if the song is right.

\subsection*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (Lethai-ar, fae, beast-kin, empire echoes)}
\label{sec:valewood-people}

\item Owl-sister whose pupils show yesterday; her hands show yours.
\item Antler-masked hunter sworn to keep cities sleeping.

\item Warden-coterie of beast-kin (badger, stag, lynx) with one law: no digging deep.
\item Echo-legionary---imperial shade bound to a patrol that never ends.

\item[Q] Hazel Queen of the Lethai-ar, sovereign in leaf and law.
\item[K] Alder King of the Twilit Court, sovereign in shadow and debt.
\item[A] The Huntsman Between, antlers of moonlight; shortcuts owe him.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (glamour, ward-traps, imperial residue)}
\label{sec:valewood-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Sweet wind nudges landmarks a hedge's width---enough to matter.
\item Path reverses---your footprints vote to go elsewhere.
\item Ward-trap flares---ancient security treats you as yesterday's invader.

\item[Q] Court tithe levied: truth, song, or a memory you'd miss.
\item[K] Muster of Boughs---green banners rise; travel becomes trespass.
\item[A] Empire wakes---a district aligns; doors open, guardians open farther.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (charms, keys, truce-boughs, old rights)}
\label{sec:valewood-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Way-cord---knot points to the true next turn (once).
\item Dew-mirror---see a thing as it is, not as sung, for one scene.
\item Hazel token---lawful crossing of a warded hedge without snag.
\item Honey-right---eat and speak safely at any bee-stone ring.
\item Name-bead---a kept promise warms; a broken one chills and glows.
\item Wind-veil sprig---mute the sweet wind's lies for a short walk.
\item City-key shard---wake one gate or stair in a phasing ruin.

\item[J] Shardwright's favor---repair or light a length of star-road.
\item[Q] Audience at Hazel Hall---one whisper exits as policy.
\item[K] Alder Writ---levies defer, wardens guide, scribes stop arguing.
\item[A] Valeheart Clause---temporary exception to any local rule, spoken in leaves.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Quick Use Notes}
\label{sec:valewood-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds = codified outcomes (keys/rights/passes) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item Empire Echo: when a J/Q/K is the highest rank in your seed, add one visible relic-logic (floating stairs, singing locks, patrol-shades).
\item Aces: any A means the wood actively rearranges paths or wakes structures; echo that change later so the place feels alive.
\item If any A appears, echo leaf \& light motifs---paths that remember, leaves that whisper, and light that moves like water.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\label{sec:valewood-features}

\paragraph{Forest Claims}
Any oath, bargain, or gift exchanged in the Valewood binds with more weight. Once per session, a spoken promise becomes magically enforceable: breaking it creates 1d4 SB and echoes through later scenes.

\paragraph{Ruins Awaken}
If you linger at an ancient site, roll or draw to see which imperial mechanism stirs. It may grant guidance (a lighted star-road, a memory shown) or danger (patrol shades, collapsing glyphs).

\paragraph{Court Interference}
Encounters with fae or beast-kin are never neutral. Once per session, the GM may convert a Diamond into a demand for hospitality, tribute, or alliance---a shift that alters the tone of the entire expedition.
