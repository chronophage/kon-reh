\label{sec:valewood-rewards}

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:valewood-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds = codified outcomes (keys/rights/passes) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item Empire Echo: when a J/Q/K is the highest rank in your seed, add one visible relic-logic (floating stairs, singing locks, patrol-shades).
\item Aces: any A means the wood actively rearranges paths or wakes structures; echo that change later so the place feels alive.
\item If any A appears, echo leaf \& light motifs---paths that remember, leaves that whisper, and light that moves like water.
\end{itemize}
