\section{Valewood --- ``Empire Under Leaves''}
\label{chap:valewood}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
The Valewood is older than kingdoms, older than the maps that skirt its borders. Beneath its canopy lie the bones of a Lethai empire whose name is forgotten, its towers swallowed by vine and root, its star-roads cracked and phasing between worlds. The air here hums with half-remembered songs of magic, and the ruins bleed their mysteries into root and stream. Fae courts linger in clearings that shift with moonlight, beast-kin patrol moss-choked cairns, and echoes of imperial shades still march patrols on vanished streets. To walk the Valewood is to risk being claimed by it: as guest, prey, heir—or trespasser.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Phasing Ruin/Star-Road/Living Stone)} Star-road shard with pale flagstones that hum when trod in sequence; rooted amphitheatre with moss-seats remembering speeches.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:valewood-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (charms/keys/passes) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item Empire Echo: when a J/Q/K is the highest rank in your seed, add one visible relic-logic (floating stairs, singing locks, patrol-shades).
\item Aces: any A means the wood actively rearranges paths or wakes structures; echo that change later so the place feels alive.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{leaf \& light} motifs---paths that remember, leaves that whisper, light that moves like water.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Forest Claims:} Any oath, bargain, or gift exchanged binds with more weight. Once per session, spoken promise becomes magically enforceable: breaking creates 1d4 SB and echoes through scenes.
\item \textbf{Ruins Awaken:} If you linger at ancient site, roll/draw to see which mechanism stirs. May grant guidance (lit star-road, memory shown) or danger (patrol shades, collapsing glyphs).
\item \textbf{Court Interference:} Encounters with fae/beast-kin never neutral. Once per session, GM may convert Diamond into demand for hospitality, tribute, or alliance---shifts expedition tone.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In the Valewood, power flows through ancient magic, forgotten oaths, and the delicate balance between guest and host. The Lethai-ar maintain influence through their knowledge of paths and ruins, while fae courts wield power through hospitality and geas. Beast-kin serve as guardians of the deeper mysteries, and the echoes of the empire still patrol their eternal rounds, enforcing laws written in starlight and stone.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in the Valewood revolves around hospitality, knowledge, and the careful navigation of ancient laws. Rewards often take the form of charms, keys, or safe passage that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, mirrors, cords) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival courts issue conflicting protections, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the ruins, groves, and star-roads as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of ancient customs determines success.
\end{itemize}
In the Valewood, your word is your world, and your world determines whether you walk as guest or ghost.

\subsection*{Valewood — Empire Under Leaves}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A moss‑covered amphitheatre where roots crawl through marble benches and owls whisper verdicts to the wind.
\begin{quote}
“In the Valewood, truth grows wild, and the forest remembers what kingdoms forget.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Rooted Amphitheatre, an Owl-Sister speaks in riddles. ``The Lethai-ar stir,'' she says. ``And the paths remember your true name.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Leaf empires, root theaters, beast parliaments, true-name law.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Speak a name you buried,'' ``Eat forest bread,'' ``Follow a path alone.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Lethai-ar Council''; Fracture: ``Paths Rearrange''; Community: ``Village Forgets.''
\paragraph{Complications} Owls repeat lies; bark takes fingerprints; trails loop across seasons.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A childhood glade; a traveling companion’s memory.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} A tree grows in a room.
\paragraph{Relief} Trade a name for safe passage; stage a truth in the amphitheatre; accept a forest-mark.
