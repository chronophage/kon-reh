\section{Valewood --- ``Empire Under Leaves''}
\label{chap:valewood}

\subsection*{Elite (Hazel Queen)}
\textit{``The forest here remembers empires that crumbled to dust, and its laws are older than your kingdoms. To walk these paths is to enter into covenant with powers that measure time in seasons, not years.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Pathweaver who knots safe routes into cord)}
\textit{``The woods here got a mind of their own – they'll lead you where you need to go if you ask right, but they'll just as soon lose you if you're carrying ill intent. Best know which is which before you wander off the path.''}


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
The Valewood is older than kingdoms, older than the maps that skirt its borders. Beneath its canopy lie the bones of a Lethai empire whose name is forgotten, its towers swallowed by vine and root, its star-roads cracked and phasing between worlds. The air here hums with half-remembered songs of magic, and the ruins bleed their mysteries into root and stream. Fae courts linger in clearings that shift with moonlight, beast-kin patrol moss-choked cairns, and echoes of imperial shades still march patrols on vanished streets. To walk the Valewood is to risk being claimed by it: as guest, prey, heir—or trespasser.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Phasing Ruin/Star-Road/Living Stone)} Star-road shard with pale flagstones that hum when trod in sequence; rooted amphitheatre with moss-seats remembering speeches.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:valewood-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (charms/keys/passes) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item Empire Echo: when a J/Q/K is the highest rank in your seed, add one visible relic-logic (floating stairs, singing locks, patrol-shades).
\item Aces: any A means the wood actively rearranges paths or wakes structures; echo that change later so the place feels alive.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{leaf \& light} motifs---paths that remember, leaves that whisper, light that moves like water.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Forest Claims:} Any oath, bargain, or gift exchanged binds with more weight. Once per session, spoken promise becomes magically enforceable: breaking creates 1d4 SB and echoes through scenes.
\item \textbf{Ruins Awaken:} If you linger at ancient site, roll/draw to see which mechanism stirs. May grant guidance (lit star-road, memory shown) or danger (patrol shades, collapsing glyphs).
\item \textbf{Court Interference:} Encounters with fae/beast-kin never neutral. Once per session, GM may convert Diamond into demand for hospitality, tribute, or alliance---shifts expedition tone.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In the Valewood, power flows through ancient magic, forgotten oaths, and the delicate balance between guest and host. The Lethai-ar maintain influence through their knowledge of paths and ruins, while fae courts wield power through hospitality and geas. Beast-kin serve as guardians of the deeper mysteries, and the echoes of the empire still patrol their eternal rounds, enforcing laws written in starlight and stone.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in the Valewood revolves around hospitality, knowledge, and the careful navigation of ancient laws. Rewards often take the form of charms, keys, or safe passage that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, mirrors, cords) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival courts issue conflicting protections, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the ruins, groves, and star-roads as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of ancient customs determines success.
\end{itemize}
In the Valewood, your word is your world, and your world determines whether you walk as guest or ghost.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Valewood — Empire Under Leaves}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A moss‑covered amphitheatre where roots crawl through marble benches and owls whisper verdicts to the wind.
\begin{quote}
“In the Valewood, truth grows wild, and the forest remembers what kingdoms forget.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Rooted Amphitheatre, an Owl-Sister speaks in riddles. ``The Lethai-ar stir,'' she says. ``And the paths remember your true name.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Leaf empires, root theaters, beast parliaments, true-name law.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Speak a name you buried,'' ``Eat forest bread,'' ``Follow a path alone.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Lethai-ar Council''; Fracture: ``Paths Rearrange''; Community: ``Village Forgets.''

\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A childhood glade; a traveling companion’s memory.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} A tree grows in a room.
\paragraph{Relief} Trade a name for safe passage; stage a truth in the amphitheatre; accept a forest-mark.

% ====== VALEWOOD: PLUG-IN EXTENSIONS (PATHS, NAMES, COURTS, RUINS) ======

\subsection*{Extensions (Plug-in)}
\label{sec:valewood-extensions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Name Economy (true-name pressure):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Each PC has \emph{Name Facets}: \textbf{Called-Name} (common), \textbf{Given-Name} (trusted), \textbf{True-Edge} (dangerous).
    \item When a foe or court learns a deeper facet, mark \emph{Name Leverage} [3]. At 3, they may compel one precise action or forbid one path unless countered by a \Diamond{} or \textbf{Oathsap}.
    \item You may trade a shallower facet to erase 1 tick from \emph{Name Leverage} but gain \emph{Rumor Tail} condition until scene end.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Hospitality Ledger (guest/host law):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item When \emph{Honey-Right} or \emph{Truce-Bough} is invoked, set a 3-step \emph{Table Owed} clock for the host and a 3-step \emph{Courtesy Owed} for the guest.
    \item Ticking your clock grants +1d to social tests with that party; overpaying (4+) converts 1 tick into a portable \emph{Favor Twig} (spend for +1 Position later).
    \item Breaking either clock spawns \emph{Ring Claim} or \emph{Oath-Magnet} at keeper's option.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Path-Logic Mini-game (finding the true way):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Two opposed clocks per journey: \emph{True Way} vs \emph{Forest Has You} (size by highest rank in seed).
    \item Each leg, pick an \emph{Approach}: \textbf{Rhyme} (speak pattern), \textbf{Count} (steps/time), \textbf{Gift} (leave token), \textbf{Listen} (ambient omen).
    \item Edge: Rhyme\(\rightarrow\)Gift (courtesies bind), Gift\(\rightarrow\)Count (land answers), Count\(\rightarrow\)Listen (timing frames omen), Listen\(\rightarrow\)Rhyme (echo feeds verse).
    \item Spend \textbf{Way-Cord} to flip a failed leg; spend \textbf{Wind-Veil} to ignore \textbf{Sweet Wind} once.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Truth Mechanics (seeing through glamour):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dew-Mirror} reveals one \emph{Unkind Fact} in the scene; naming it aloud gives +1 Effect but ticks \emph{Court Tithe} +1.
    \item \textbf{Glyphed Bridge} judges the next lie uttered; if you pass speaking-truth, gain \emph{Bridge’s Favor} (+1 Position on crossings hereafter). If you lie, mark \emph{Name-Theft} +1.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Star-Road Procedure (phasing traversal):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item To wake a segment: meet two of three—\emph{Proper Footfall} (count/pattern), \emph{Shard Key} (city-shard, shardwright help), \emph{Witness} (owl, echo-legionary, or courtier).
    \item Success grants \emph{Between-Places}: one safe shortcut and one \emph{Echo Fee} (memory, song, or small timeline bruise chosen by GM).
    \item On a miss, spawn \textbf{Ward-Trap} or \textbf{City Phase}.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Court Etiquette (Hazel vs Alder):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hazel Audience}: pays in \emph{precision}—exact words, measured gifts. +1d when you cite prior custom or present \textbf{Moss-Scribe} ruling.
    \item \textbf{Alder Writ}: pays in \emph{obligation}—future tasks, debts. +1 Effect when you promise service; tick \emph{Oath-Magnet} +1.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Start-of-Scene Omens in Valewood (1d6):}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Leaf-Whisper}: first Listen/Study gets +1d; first boast draws \textbf{Geas Catch}.
    \item \emph{Antler Shadow}: the Huntsman watches—shortcuts improve; hiding worsens.
    \item \emph{Mirror Drip}: \textbf{Dew-Mirror} free use but \textbf{Court Tithe} starts at 1.
    \item \emph{Root Push}: terrain shifts in your favor once; buildings dislike you (locks complicate).
    \item \emph{Bird Parliament}: a rumor arrives true; one plan becomes public knowledge.
    \item \emph{Star-Tingle}: star-road easier (+1d to wake) but every \Diamond{} hereafter risks \textbf{Ward-Trap} on 1-2.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Plug-in SB Conversions (Valewood flavor):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 1 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Sweet Wind Shift}: reposition an approach vector; -1d unless you adjust method (Rhyme/Count/Gift/Listen).
    \item 2 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Obligate Courtesy}: immediate small gift or truth required; refuse and tick \emph{Name Leverage} +1.
    \item 3+ SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Empire Echo}: add a patrolling \textbf{Echo-Legionary} cohort or activate a dormant mechanism that reframes the scene.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Reputation Echoes:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Guest-Faithful}: once/session, downgrade \textbf{Ring Claim} to simple hospitality; next refused invitation spawns \textbf{Oath-Magnet}.
    \item \emph{Path-Favored}: +1 Position on \emph{Path-Logic} legs; any shortcut taken owes a \emph{token or tale}.
    \item \emph{Truth-Bearer}: +1d with Hazel court when presenting facts; -1d with Alder when declining obligation.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Quick Cross-Region Hooks:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Kahfagia Lanes \(\leftrightarrow\) Star-Roads}: a \textbf{Mirror Warrant} can stand in for \textbf{Shard Key} once.
    \item \emph{Mistlands Bells \(\leftrightarrow\) Path-Logic}: paying \textbf{Ward-Salt} counts as \emph{Gift} approach with +1d.
    \item \emph{Aelinnel Math \(\leftrightarrow\) Proper Footfall}: \emph{Counting Etiquette} grants +1 Position on \textbf{Star-Road Procedure}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% ====== VALEWOOD: BOSS HOOKS & EXTRA FLOURISHES ======

\subsection*{Boss Hooks (Courts, Echoes, \& Path-Lords)}
\label{sec:valewood-bosses}
% Calibrate each for an 8–10 clock (10 on any Ace). Show at least one "lever"—a Diamond or custom rite that can reshape or soften the fight.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Huntsman of Shortcuts} (antlers of moonlight; stride that erases distance) --- \emph{Tells:} stag-shadow advances one beat ahead; paths fold behind him. \emph{Moves:} \emph{Owe the Cut} (forces a geas: accept a detour or mark Fatigue), \emph{Step Across} (swap range bands), \emph{Tally the Tread} (names who strayed; that PC loses assist for a beat). \emph{Levers:} \textbf{Truce-Bough} halts pursuit once; \textbf{Way-Cord} cancels \emph{Step Across} once. \emph{Yield Terms:} gift a true shortcut (reveal a secret path) or agree to carry a name for him.
  \item \textbf{Redcap Captain Rill} (hat never dries; nail-shod boots) --- \emph{Tells:} polite bows that end in bruises; blood soaks into moss. \emph{Moves:} \emph{Hospitality Turned} (treats any food/drink as claim; imposes \textbf{Ring Claim}), \emph{Knee the Truth} (any lie this round deals Harm 1 as shame), \emph{Boot-Hook} (drag a PC one zone). \emph{Levers:} \textbf{Honey-Right} reverses \emph{Hospitality Turned} for one exchange; \textbf{Dew-Mirror} exposes his “host right,” downgrading his effect. \emph{Parley Price:} a song with a real regret in it.
  \item \textbf{Echo Centurion of the XIII Star-Road} (bronze mask; voice like marching rain) --- \emph{Tells:} dust arranges into ranks; orders arrive from an hour ago. \emph{Moves:} \emph{Reform the Line} (erase one positional gain), \emph{Juridical Recall} (impose ancient curfew; actions outside it start one step worse), \emph{Standard Rekindled} (summon echo cohort at weak strength). \emph{Levers:} \textbf{City-Shard} lets you counter-order once; a \textbf{Moss-Scribe} ruling (or cited custom) cancels \emph{Juridical Recall}. \emph{Dismissal:} return his cohort’s lost standard or complete their last posted watch.
  \item \textbf{Shardwright Unmended} (glassy chisels; time caught in her hair) --- \emph{Tells:} tools refuse to rust nearby; footprints “edit” themselves. \emph{Moves:} \emph{Cut the Clock} (freeze a PC’s action for one beat), \emph{Wrong Stone} (swap the cost on success: pay in memory instead of gear), \emph{Wake the Segment} (introduce \textbf{Ward-Trap}). \emph{Levers:} offer \textbf{Oathsap} to bind a repair oath; \textbf{Shardwright’s Favor} flips \emph{Wrong Stone} once. \emph{End:} either accept a lingering “timeline bruise” or escort her to the Amber Ziggurat.
  \item \textbf{The Hazel Advocate} (mask of living bark; voice measured in syllables) --- \emph{Tells:} vines reorder to proper grammar; birds hush at contradictions. \emph{Moves:} \emph{Measure the Word} (any vague promise becomes binding \textbf{Oath-Magnet}), \emph{Prune the Lie} (remove a declared fictional advantage), \emph{Court Silence} (no overlapping speech; group loses a Teamwork option for a beat). \emph{Levers:} \textbf{Hazel Token} grants speaking rights; \textbf{Oathsap} lets you safely retract one bound clause. \emph{Concession:} present a precise restitution or cede a Name-Bead.
  \item \textbf{Alder Bailiff of Debts} (ledger of favors; smile like dusk) --- \emph{Tells:} moths gather on quills; shadows count coin. \emph{Moves:} \emph{Call the Note} (convert any \Diamond{} held into an owed task), \emph{Fine in Kind} (steal 1 assist or +1d used against him), \emph{Lien on the Path} (block the next exit unless a price is paid). \emph{Levers:} \textbf{Alder Writ} lets you renegotiate once; a public gift at a \textbf{Calendar Grove} downgrades his effect for the scene.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Boss Loot \& Boons (pick 1 on victory)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Antler Shortcut}: once/arc, declare a safe mid-scene cut; clear 1 segment on \emph{True Way}.
  \item \emph{Dry Cap}: ignore one \textbf{Ring Claim} this session; next hospitality breach starts at +1 \emph{Court Tithe}.
  \item \emph{Bronze Tally}: treat an imperial \emph{Juridical Recall} as \emph{controlled} once.
  \item \emph{Edited Chisel}: swap the cost of a success (gear $\leftrightarrow$ memory) one time.
  \item \emph{Hazel Seal}: once/session, speak a precise exception; cancel \textbf{Oath-Magnet} for a clause.
  \item \emph{Dusk Ledger Slip}: pay an owed Favor Twig in advance; erase 1 tick of \emph{Name Leverage}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Legendary Sites \& Trials}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Glyphed Bridge Ordeal} --- speak a hard truth to pass dry; lie, and the bridge demands a memory tithe (mark \emph{Name Leverage} +1, gain \emph{Bridge’s Favor} only if confessed).
  \item \textbf{Moon-Cistern Vigil} --- watch someone else’s sky until the owl calls; success grants a single \textbf{Dew-Mirror} charge, failure spawns \textbf{Mirror Rain}.
  \item \textbf{Valeheart Spiral} --- climb stairs that return to start; map with verse, gift, count, listen (all four once) to unlock a \textbf{Between-Places} shortcut.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Bounties \& Prestige Tracks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Court Favors} (prestige): keep twigs/marks from Hazel or Alder. At 3 of one court, treat one \textbf{Hazel Audience}/\textbf{Alder Writ} as automatic; lose 1 if you snub the opposite court publicly.
  \item \textbf{Echo Quietus} (bounty): each laid-to-rest patrol shade adds 1; at 3, the \textbf{Echo Centurion} appears to “thank” or test you (GM choice).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cross-Region Boss Entanglements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Kahfagia Signal Leak:} defeating the \textbf{Huntsman} by Mirror tricks starts \emph{Light Shift} when you next sail a beaconed lane.
  \item \emph{Mistlands Bell Trespass:} binding the \textbf{Hazel Advocate} with bell-law triggers \emph{Rite-Purge} [2] back along the levees.
  \item \emph{Linn Feud Echo:} slaying \textbf{Redcap Captain Rill} on a truce-day begins \emph{Feud Token} [2] with a nearby strand (they liked his “hospitality”).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Boss Procedure (quick frame)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Stage the Place:} pick a site Tag (\emph{Star-Road}, \emph{Court Ring}, or \emph{Living Ruin}) and one ambient \textbf{Clubs}.
  \item \textbf{Offer the Lever:} place an attainable \Diamond{} (Way-Cord, Hazel Token, City-Shard).
  \item \textbf{Name the Cost:} declare what the wood will remember if the party cheats (start \emph{Name Leverage} [2] or \emph{Court Tithe} [2]).
  \item \textbf{Let the Forest React:} on any miss, the scene may re-path once (swap lanes or approaches per your Path-Logic mini-game).
\end{enumerate}
