\section{Ecktoria --- ``Marble \& Fire''}
\label{chap:ecktoria}

\subsection*{Elite (Grand Magistrate)}
\textit{``The law here is written not in books but in marble and flame. Every edict carries the weight of centuries, and every judgment echoes in the very stones of the Forum.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Ferrymaster who knows which banners pay late)}
\textit{``I've seen the city burn three times and rise again like a phoenix made of stone. The marble remembers, the bells tell the truth, and the fire judges all – especially those who think coin can buy clean hands.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Once the heart of the Utaran Empire, Ecktoria has worn its laurels into chains. Three centuries of sack, fire, and slow decline have not stripped its marble forums nor its gold-sealed coin-houses---but each day, more of its wealth slips into the hands of mercenaries and factions. The Black Banners march on its purse, avenging old Ykrul wounds by proxy. Processions still crown its stairways, yet ash lines every step. The city burns not only with memory, but with ambition still unquenched.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Forum/Arena/Road)} Milk-stone steps where dawn petitions are pinned; tally-ford ferryhouse with rope-drums thrumming all day.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:ecktoria-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (papers/favor/precedence) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{marble \& fire} motifs---statues that watch, flames that judge, and law that remembers every name.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Imperial Ruins}: Every district bears half-collapsed arcades, serving as markets, courts, or shelters for mercenary companies.
\item \textbf{Competing Factions}: Dukes, guilds, and priests stage processions that collide at bridges and squares, each claiming legitimacy.
\item \textbf{Monuments as Weapons}: Statues, obelisks, and colonnades are not only symbols---they're barricades, rallying points, and high ground when the city riots.
\item \textbf{Everflame Orthodoxy}: The basilicas preach unity, but each sermon is a coded signal for a political camp. The High Priest plays balance while cultivating his own following.
\item \textbf{Black Banner Contracts}: Foreign mercenaries fill the gaps left by a shrinking citizen levy, their loyalty secured only by steady coin.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
Ecktoria's decline is not collapse, but transformation. Wealth bleeds into patronage webs: a senator's indulgence, a censor's indulgence, a noble's purse. The city's great houses keep mercenary captains on retainer, while priests sell ritual processions as public theater and private favor. 

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage should function as both opportunity and trap. Any gift (a purse, permit, or charter) binds the receiver to service, but patrons can die, fall from favor, or suddenly proscribe what they once allowed. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (seals, ribbons, laurel crowns) that can be stolen, forged, or voided.
\item Let rival patrons issue conflicting ``safe-conducts,'' forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use processions, funerals, or trials as arenas for social contests, where patronage debts surface and shift allegiances.
\end{itemize}
Patronage in Ecktoria is not mere background---it is the engine of politics, coin, and survival.

\subsection*{Ecktoria — Marble and Fire}
\textbf{Starting Location:} The Coin‑House floor, marble cracked with soot lines, where votive candles burn beside melted icons.
\begin{quote}
“In Ecktoria, even faith must balance its ledgers, and the gods audit in ash.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} The Coin-House floor, a factor with smoke-singed ledgers offers a purse. ``The Lame King moves,'' she says. ``And the Basilica burns with him.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Coin-oaths, basilica relics, marble acoustics, augury smoke.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Bid against the city,'' ``Pocket the relic shard,'' ``Name an innocent debtor.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Procession of Ash''; Community: ``Credit Panic''; Anchor: ``Basilica Choir.''
\paragraph{Complications} Smoke speaks truths; coins stick to skin; a reliquary runs hot.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A choir novice; a patron account.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The Basilica tolls a note only one PC hears.
\paragraph{Relief} Return the shard; pay a city-debt in blood or \Boons{}; route the procession elsewhere.

% ====== ECKTORIA: PLUG-IN EXTENSIONS (OPULENCE vs. WANING POWER) ======

\subsection*{Extensions (Plug-in)}
\label{sec:ecktoria-extensions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cross-Region Hooks (optional draws):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Aeler True Masons bid} to shore a failing aqueduct; accepting stabilizes \emph{Aftershock} but grants them soft leverage in the ward.
    \item \emph{Aelinnel Green-Market broker} offers “truth-credit” on court gossip; pay later in favors or names.
    \item \emph{Black Banner retainer} parade demands back pay on the Triumph Stairs; crowd sympathy tilts your next parley.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Faction Entanglements During Travel (use en route or on city entry):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If the party holds any \emph{Condotta} Diamonds, begin with \emph{Bread Riots} at +1 segment (mercenary grain trains re-routed).
    \item Entering with an \emph{Underway Pass} (Aeler) grants +1 Position on \emph{Aqueduct Walk} scenes but ticks \emph{Ducal Conflict} once (guild jealousy).
    \item Carrying \emph{Green Market} tags downgrades one \emph{Censor's Hall} action but flags \emph{Inquisitorial Visit} at the next temple.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Patron Touchpoints (drop the ones you like):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Maelstraeus (Cosmic Ledger):} Coin-houses keep shadow ledgers; once/session convert one social success into a \emph{Coin-House Credit} Diamond but start a \emph{Karmic Debt} [6].
    \item \textbf{Mykkiel (The Writ):} Any \emph{Procession Permit} can be notarized as an \emph{Oath Irons} lite: breaking its terms applies -1 die to legal actions for a scene.
    \item \textbf{Lunara (Witchlight):} \emph{Everflame Cloister} niches hide “silver mirrors”; on use, ask one yes/no about civic intrigue; mark Exposure +1.
    \item \textbf{The Traveler (Ways):} Map the \emph{Triumph Stairs} as a living route: spend 1 Boon to treat one crowd scene as \emph{overland progress} for clocks.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Trade Good Consequences (pick 1 when a haul sells):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Arena Steel} $\rightarrow$ street duels spike $\rightarrow$ start \emph{Arena Spill} at 1.
    \item \emph{Relic Fragments} $\rightarrow$ basilica prestige swings $\rightarrow$ tick \emph{Church Purge} or grant \emph{Basilica Audience}.
    \item \emph{Survey Rights} $\rightarrow$ boundary re-plat $\rightarrow$ downgrade one \emph{Border Dispute} \emph{or} upgrade a rival’s.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Diplomatic Favor (minor currency):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Earn by resolving a public scene without bloodshed (Forum, Procession, Coin-House).
    \item Spend 1 to reduce DV of a permit/audience by 1, or to ignore \emph{Blocked Bridge} for one crossing.
    \item Holding 2+ makes you “interesting”: start a \emph{Red List} [4] that advances on snubbed patrons.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Reputation Echoes (soft power):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Crowd-Loved (Laurel-Deed):} first time per session you face a mob, set Position one step safer.
    \item \emph{Coin-House Trusted (Credit):} ignore the first \emph{Frozen Purse}; next time, it returns at +1 severity.
    \item \emph{Clerically Vouched (Everflame):} downgrade one \emph{Inquisitorial Visit}; if abused, promote \emph{Church Purge}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Monuments as Mechanics (opulence with teeth)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Processional Geometry:} When acting on the \emph{Triumph Stairs}, choose: +1 Effect \emph{or} -1 Heat; on a miss, \emph{Rerouted Triumph} advances.
  \item \textbf{Aqueduct Leverage:} Securing an aqueduct span grants a one-scene \emph{high ground} tag in any linked ward; if collateral hits, tick \emph{Aftershock}.
  \item \textbf{Forum Acoustics:} Rally speeches at the \emph{Grand Forum} grant an extra assist die if at least 20 witnesses; failure spawns \emph{Bread Riots} at +1.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Plug-in SB Conversions (Ecktoria flavor)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Any 1 SB may become \emph{Crowd Drift}: shift the scene’s terrain in favor of or against you (bridges clog, stairs clear).
  \item Any 2 SB may become \emph{Seal Revoked}: void one paper (Permit/Chit/Indulgence); to avert, sacrifice \emph{Diplomatic Favor}.
  \item On 3+ SB offer \emph{Patron Bargain}: accept a visible mark (ribbon, laurel brand) to halve consequences; start a \emph{Patron Debt} [6].
\end{itemize}
