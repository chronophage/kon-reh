\section{Ecktoria --- ``Marble \& Fire'' Generator}
\label{chap:ecktoria}

Once the heart of the Utaran Empire, Ecktoria has worn its laurels into chains. Three centuries of sack, fire, and slow decline have not stripped its marble forums nor its gold-sealed coin-houses—but each day, more of its wealth slips into the hands of mercenaries and factions. The Black Banners march on its purse, avenging old Ykrul wounds by proxy. Processions still crown its stairways, yet ash lines every step. The city burns not only with memory, but with ambition still unquenched.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (edicts, crowds, fault-lines)}
\label{sec:ecktoria-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Procession blocks the only bridge till sundown.
\item Sudden edict: your sigil is now proscribed.
\item Grain barges late---bread riots hiss at the edges.
\item Arena riot spills into the streets; shutters slam.
\item Rival dukes levy the same ward; your recruits vanish.

\item[A] Secret Red List---your patron's name appears overnight.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (papers, favor, precedence)}
\label{sec:ecktoria-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Bread chit for a ward---street patience for a week.
\item Procession permit---move sacred flame through a crowded quarter.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:ecktoria-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (papers/favor/precedence) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo marble \& fire motifs---statues that watch, flames that judge, and law that remembers every name.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Imperial Ruins}: Every district bears half-collapsed arcades, serving as markets, courts, or shelters for mercenary companies.
\item \textbf{Competing Factions}: Dukes, guilds, and priests stage processions that collide at bridges and squares, each claiming legitimacy.
\item \textbf{Monuments as Weapons}: Statues, obelisks, and colonnades are not only symbols—they’re barricades, rallying points, and high ground when the city riots.
\item \textbf{Everflame Orthodoxy}: The basilicas preach unity, but each sermon is a coded signal for a political camp. The High Priest plays balance while cultivating his own following.
\item \textbf{Black Banner Contracts}: Foreign mercenaries fill the gaps left by a shrinking citizen levy, their loyalty secured only by steady coin.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!7!white,colframe=black!60!white,title=Decline \& Patronage]
Ecktoria’s decline is not collapse, but transformation. Wealth bleeds into patronage webs: a senator’s indulgence, a censor’s indulgence, a noble’s purse. The city’s great houses keep mercenary captains on retainer, while priests sell ritual processions as public theater and private favor. 

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage should function as both opportunity and trap. Any gift (a purse, permit, or charter) binds the receiver to service, but patrons can die, fall from favor, or suddenly proscribe what they once allowed. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (seals, ribbons, laurel crowns) that can be stolen, forged, or voided.
\item Let rival patrons issue conflicting “safe-conducts,” forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use processions, funerals, or trials as arenas for social contests, where patronage debts surface and shift allegiances.
\end{itemize}
Patronage in Ecktoria is not mere background—it is the engine of politics, coin, and survival.
