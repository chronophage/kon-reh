### **Connection Opportunities**
Consider highlighting relationships between regions:
- How do **Linn raiders** interact with **Viterra's borders**?
- What's the relationship between **Kahfagia's Western Trade** and **The Ways Between**?
- How do **Vhasia's fractured loyalties** affect **Vilikari's federated position**?

### **Timeline Depth**
- What major events occurred in the 300 years since Utar's fall?
- How do the **Aeler** (Mistlands) and **Khaz-Vurim** (Ubral) fit into the broader political landscape?
- What's driving current conflicts (Black Banners, Ykrul wars)?

### **Player Integration Points**
Your generators are excellent for GM preparation. Consider adding more explicit hooks for:
- Character backgrounds tied to specific regions
- Factions players might join or oppose
- Starting scenarios that showcase each region's unique elements
