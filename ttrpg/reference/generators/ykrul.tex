\section{Ykrul --- ``Wolf Standards, Winter Camps'' Generator}
\label{chap:ykrul}

\noindent
The Ykrul ride the endless steppe where horizon meets sky and law rides in saddlebags. Hosts gather by the thousand, yet break into fragments at a word; one night you share their fires, the next they test your bonds. Their banners are wolves’ teeth, their treaties braided strings, their memory longer than the rivers that cross their roads.

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\label{sec:ykrul-features}

\paragraph{Hostage Strings}
Every oath on the steppe is secured with a \textbf{hostage string}---a token kin, retainer, or sworn ally left in the other camp. If a deal is broken, the hostage’s fate becomes the story’s next beat.

\paragraph{Steppe Law}
Travelers in Ykrul lands are bound by \textbf{steppe law}: hospitality lasts three nights, insults last three generations. The Keeper may demand 1 SB when either law is broken.

\paragraph{Sky Omens}
When the sky shows strange signs---mock-suns, green fire, thunder without storm---the steppe itself seems to speak. Players may once per scene treat an omen as a Diamond, shifting position without a roll.
