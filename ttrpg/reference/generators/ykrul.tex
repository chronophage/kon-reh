\section{Ykrul (Orc) --- ``Wolf Standards, Winter Camps''}
\label{chap:ykrul}

\subsection*{Elite (Khatun of Ring)}
\textit{``The steppe remembers every oath sworn beneath its endless sky, and the wolf-standards carry the honor of clans that have outlasted empires. To lead here is to keep the old ways sharp as winter steel.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Herd-scout with three ponies and six opinions)}
\textit{``The horses know the weather before it comes, and the wolves know the thoughts in a man's heart. Best speak true and ride steady – the steppe don't forgive lies or clumsy hands on the reins.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
The Ykrul ride the endless steppe where horizon meets sky and law rides in saddlebags. Hosts gather by the thousand, yet break into fragments at a word; one night you share their fires, the next they test your bonds. Their banners are wolves' teeth, their treaties braided strings, their memory longer than the rivers that cross their roads.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:ykrul-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (passes/remounts/truces) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{steppe \& sky} motifs---wind that speaks, horses that remember, and treaties that bind across generations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hostage Strings:} Every oath secured with \textbf{hostage string}---token kin, retainer, sworn ally left in other camp. If deal broken, hostage's fate becomes story's next beat.
\item \textbf{Steppe Law:} Travelers bound by \textbf{steppe law}: hospitality lasts three nights, insults last three generations. Keeper may demand 1 SB when either law broken.
\item \textbf{Sky Omens:} When sky shows strange signs---mock-suns, green fire, thunder without storm---steppe itself speaks. Players may once per scene treat omen as Diamond, shifting position without roll.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Ykrul society, power flows through the careful management of hospitality, the binding of oaths with hostages, and the ability to navigate the complex web of tribal relationships. The Khagan maintains authority through the loyalty of noyans and the respect of khatuns, while local leaders wield influence through their control of resources like salt, remounts, and safe passage. The true power lies with those who understand the ancient customs and can maintain the delicate balance between hospitality and honor.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Ykrul society revolves around hospitality, hostage exchanges, and the ability to command respect from hosts and courts. Rewards often take the form of tokens, treaties, and official positions that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, braids, standards) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival hosts issue conflicting protections, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the camps, councils, and crossings as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of custom and honor determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Ykrul society, your word is your bond, and your bond determines whether you ride as guest or ghost.

\section*{Thematic SB Spend Table}
\label{sec:ykrul-sb}

\subsection*{Minor Complications (1 SB)}

\item \textbf{Rail Tick:} Advance a relevant campaign/front clock by 1 segment.
\item \textbf{Condition Applied:} Mark \textbf{Fatigue 1/Harm 1/Condition} appropriate to fiction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Major Turns (4+ SB)}

\item \textbf{Patron Omen:} Divine/arcane forces take notice - \textbf{omen appears/blessing lost/curse manifests}.
\item \textbf{Narrative Pivot:} The story takes an unexpected turn that reframes objectives.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Region-Specific SB Options}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ykrul (Steppe Law):} Hospitality expires without warning, insults carry forward through generations, treaties are reinterpreted mid-conversation.
\item \textbf{Ykrul (Horse Culture):} Mounts refuse to obey, remount stations are empty, riding skills become unreliable.
\item \textbf{Ykrul (Sky Omens):} Weather patterns shift unpredictably, celestial signs contradict each other, navigation becomes mystical.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Ykrul — Wolf Standards}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A winter camp on the steppe edge, banners snapping in frost‑bright wind as the Khagan’s fires burn in the east.
\begin{quote}
“In Ykrul, the wind carries the pack’s oath, and mercy is left to thaw.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Winter Camp, a Khatun of Ring offers salt-allotment. ``The Khagan’s kin ride,'' she says. ``And the sky omens bleed east.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Hearth-ring law, wolf totems, bone-lot omens, steppe trials.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Eat salt without being invited,'' ``Ride a sacred mount,'' ``Claim an omen for yourself.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Community: ``Ring Divided''; Threat: ``Kin Raid''; Anchor: ``Salt Peace.''
\paragraph{Complications} Wolves refuse shadow; lots stain hands; riders circle dreams.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A hearth-mother; a winter store.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The sky opens a red seam.
\paragraph{Relief} Share salt and story; win the trial without blood; send the omen back with a song.

\subsection*{Mobility \& Logistics (Fast Play)}

\paragraph{Host Posture (declare before a leg)}
Pick \emph{two}: \textbf{Speed}, \textbf{Screen}, \textbf{Spare Mounts}, \textbf{Scavenge}.  
Each grants +1 Position on one relevant action this leg; neglected ones are -1 Position if tested.

\paragraph{String Roles}
Name: \textbf{Point-Scout}, \textbf{Remount-Keeper}, \textbf{Salt-Warden}, \textbf{Banner-Talker}.  
Each can cover one miss per leg by marking a minor cost (a pony, salt, time, favor).

\paragraph{Remount Rhythm}
A rider with \textbf{2+ fresh mounts} may \emph{double-march} once per day (mark \emph{Fatigue 1}).  
Spending a \emph{Remount Chit} clears that Fatigue for one rider and negates \emph{Pursuit} once.
\subsection*{Steppe Weather \& Ground (d12)}

\begin{tabular}{p{0.12\textwidth} p{0.28\textwidth} p{0.52\textwidth}}
\textbf{d12} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Tags / Effects} \\
\hline
1 & Blue Vault & +Survey; long sight cuts both ways \\
2 & River Breath & Low fog in hollows; -Speed off-road, +Stealth in reeds \\
3 & Dry Snow & Tracks show, hooves sure; cold bites fingers (gear tests -1) \\
4 & Black Ice & Fords become coin flips; carts lie \\
5 & Rasputitsa & Earth to porridge; wheels -2 Effect; sleds +1 \\
6 & Dust Devil & Ranged beyond close is risky; eyes sting \\
7 & North Knife & Wind shear; tents fight, words don’t carry \\
8 & Heat Shimmer & Mirage bands; long shots misjudge distance \\
9 & Grassfire Smell & Any spark can turn Club into \emph{Elemental Front} \\
10 & Star-Hard Night & Camp mends are brittle; sleep restores less \\
11 & Wolf Moon & Animals keen; omens cheap but sticky (see Sky Omens) \\
12 & Three Suns & Omen; GM may bank 1 SB to twist weather next leg \\
\end{tabular}
\subsection*{Hostage Strings (Custom Subsystem)}

\paragraph{Make a String}
Name the \textbf{token-kin} (page, foster, sworn hand) and knot a \emph{Hostage String}.  
While the string stands:
\begin{itemize}
\item Parties treat each other as \emph{Camp Token} guests on sight.
\item First betrayal converts one \textbf{Diamond} to \emph{Safe-Hostage} instead of breaking truce.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Cut a String}
When a string is cut (ritual, flight, or knife), trigger one:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Blood Call:} Immediate \emph{Feud Spark}.
\item \textbf{Salt Call:} A council demands wergild in \emph{Salt Allotment} or stock.
\item \textbf{Road Call:} The \emph{Road-Judge} schedules a trial-ride (race, bout, riddle).
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Camp \& Council Procedures}

\paragraph{Three-Fire Camp}
Ykrul hospitality lasts \textbf{three nights}. Each night, pick one boon and accept one cost:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Boons:} mend tack; swap mounts (-1 Fatigue for one rider); hear a \emph{Bone-Song} (ask one question of the dead of this land); secure \emph{Escort Braid}.
\item \textbf{Costs:} sit watch; tell a true story; gift salt or steel; accept a minor geas (don’t ride east at dawn, etc.).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Council Hollow (kurultai mini-game)}
Frame three \emph{beats}: \textbf{Salt}, \textbf{String}, \textbf{Standard}.  
Win two to carry the vote.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Salt (economy):} Offer stores, routes, or \emph{Market-Green}. Failure births \emph{Salt Shortage}.
\item \textbf{String (kin):} Place/accept \emph{Safe-Hostage}, cite adoption, foster, marriage-feast.
\item \textbf{Standard (prestige):} Gift wolf-tooth, recount raid, pledge riders; victory grants \emph{Standard Guard}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Trade \& Tribute}

\paragraph{Steppe Staples}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Salt \& Fat:} Currency and winter life. Spend \emph{Salt Allotment} to cancel \emph{Supply Strain} for a week or bribe a \emph{Remount Keeper}.
\item \textbf{Horses:} Money that moves. A \emph{Remount Chit} equals one serious favor at \emph{Trading Palisade}.
\item \textbf{Stories:} Soft currency. A true raid-tale can stand in for coin once per council.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Palisade Rates (d6)}
1 fair trade \quad 2 short scales \quad 3 hidden tithe \quad 4 hostage asked \quad 5 rival claim \quad 6 market under \emph{Market-Green} today
\subsection*{Feud \& Reconciliation}

\paragraph{What starts a Feud (d6)}
1 insult at fire \quad 2 horse swapped sick \quad 3 string cut \quad 4 grave ridden over  
5 name spoken wrong \quad 6 salt denied

\paragraph{How to end it (pick two)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Wergild:} Pay in \emph{Salt Allotment}, mounts, or labor.
\item \textbf{Trial-Ride:} Outrun, outshoot, or outstand the winter. Winner declares terms.
\item \textbf{Bone-Song:} Ask the kurgan; accept the dead’s price.
\item \textbf{Marriage-Fire:} Feast that binds hosts; costs you a \emph{Safe-Hostage}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Hit-and-Run Warfare (Three Beats)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Screen:} Scouts contest vision with dust, snow, reeds. Win: choose engagement range; loss: ambushed (Position -1).
\item \textbf{Shock:} Loose, loose, loose—then crash. Spend \emph{Standard Guard} to ignore first rout check or \emph{Escort Braid} to peel a unit free.
\item \textbf{Break-off:} A clean ride beats a clean kill. Spend \emph{Remount Chit} or test under \emph{Rasputitsa/Black Ice}.
\end{enumerate}
On a miss at any beat, mark \emph{Stragglers}: you leave someone or something behind.
\subsection*{Sky Omens (d8)}

1 wolves howl at noon \quad 2 aurora like braids \quad 3 three suns \quad 4 moon with teeth  
5 thunder without storm \quad 6 stars “follow” riders \quad 7 dust column stands still \quad 8 hawk falls asleep mid-flight

\emph{Reading an omen} creates a one-scene tag you can cash as a \textbf{Diamond} or force as a \textbf{Club}; doing so changes someone’s mind about the omen’s meaning.
\subsection*{Clocks \& Escalations}

\paragraph{Ring Divided (6)}
1–2: Standards drift. \quad 3–4: Camps split routes. \quad 5: A string is cut. \quad 6: Winter ring becomes two hosts.

\paragraph{Wolf Road Tightens (6)}
1–2: Posts check brands. \quad 3–4: Papers challenged. \quad 5: \emph{Foedus Recall}. \quad 6: \emph{Wolf Muster}—road becomes checkpoints.

\paragraph{Salt Peace (4)}
1: Stores counted publicly. \quad 2–3: Sharing enforced by Khatun. \quad 4: Feast; next \emph{Salt Shortage} is ignored once.
\subsection*{NPC Templates}

\paragraph{Camp-Mother (Fire-Chosen)}
\emph{Wants:} No famine this winter.  
\emph{Leverage:} Can bless/deny \emph{Camp Token}.  
\emph{Cost:} Speak a hard truth by second firelight.

\paragraph{Road-Judge (Seal-Patient)}
\emph{Wants:} A treaty rewritten for sense.  
\emph{Leverage:} Upgrades one paper to \emph{Paiza Tablet} for a day.  
\emph{Cost:} Accept that their ruling stands—even if it cuts you.

\paragraph{Remount Keeper (String-Math)}
\emph{Wants:} A rival’s book of brands.  
\emph{Leverage:} Two fresh ponies at dawn.  
\emph{Cost:} Return them better than you found them—or owe a foal.

\paragraph{Titles}
\emph{Khagan} (over-king), \emph{Khatun} (camp-law), \emph{Noyan} (banner-lord), \emph{Tümen-Scribe} (road-judge), \emph{String-Mother} (hostage keeper).

\subsection*{Cross-Regional Conversions}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Vilikari:} \emph{Paiza Tablet} reads as \emph{Purple Warrant} at \emph{Milefort}; tick \textbf{Two-Law} once.
\item \textbf{Vhasia:} \emph{Standard Guard} counts as \emph{Safe-Conduct} on \emph{King’s High Road} until next \emph{Chevauchée}.
\item \textbf{Theona:} \emph{Safe-Hostage} may stand in for a \emph{Bride-Charter} (peace for a season) if bells ring eight and not nine.
\item \textbf{Valewood:} A \emph{Bone-Song} grants a one-scene \emph{Dew-Mirror} if sung at a \emph{Barrow Field} grove.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Encounter Seeds}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Kurgan Debt:} A \emph{Bone-Singer} bids you return a stolen bridle; success earns \emph{Ring Audience}, delay wakes an \emph{Echo-Legionary}… from under grass.
\item \textbf{Salt for Strings:} The \emph{Trading Palisade} is out of salt; only your \emph{Market-Green} can open stores—if you place a \emph{Safe-Hostage}.
\item \textbf{Wolf on the Road:} A wolf with a torn banner in its mouth paces your camp; follow to a lost \emph{Pontoon Crossing} before the river breaks.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Designer Hooks (Optional)}

\paragraph{Banner-Deeds}
Record one daring ride as a \emph{Deed}. Once per session, flash the Deed to step Position up on rally/negotiation with riders who honor that style.

\paragraph{Storm-Borrow}
Offer a steel gift to the \emph{Sky-Speaker} during \emph{Three Suns}; on a hit, bank \emph{Sky’s Exception}. On a miss, weather splits—half on you, half on your friends.

\subsection*{Steppe Homage Sites \& Lairs (drop-in hexes)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Wolf-Teeth Palisade} — Trading yard ringed with jawbone pickets; scales hang from rawhide cords that only balance for fair deals.
  \item \textbf{Sky-Drum Kopje} — Wind hollows beat like hooves at dusk; a buried drum answers only to the Khagan’s cadence.
  \item \textbf{Salt-Wheel Flats} — Crust pans etched with cart runes; turning the sun-bleached axle calls remounts from mirage distance.
  \item \textbf{Nine-Kurgan String} — Barrows aligned to winter stars; a bone-singer can “pluck” omens like notes to sway a council.
  \item \textbf{Frost-Bitten Forum} — Utaran milestone half-swallowed by loess; steppe law carved \emph{over} imperial script decides ford rights.
  \item \textbf{Sable-Creek Corrals} — Hides stretch on willow frames; a ghost ledger tallies every foal traded, never wrong, never kind.
  \item \textbf{Black Hoof Monastery} — Rock hermitage with hoofprints set in basalt; novices test honesty against a hoof-bell that rings for lies.
  \item \textbf{Storm-Bone Causeway} — Vertebrae bridge across a reed-gorge; crossing at a gallop wakes the bones to judge riders’ courage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Steppe Bestiary (palette)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Steppe Manticores} — Lionine torsos, porcupine tails of bone quills. \emph{Signs:} quills in fence-posts; ponies refuse to drink. \emph{Hook:} play a raid-song backward; they circle to listen.
  \item \textbf{Dust Hulks} — Wind-packed silhouettes that rise from dunes. \emph{Signs:} dunes “breathe”; grit sifts upward. \emph{Hook:} spill water on their shadow; they settle for a watch.

  \item \textbf{Frost Wargs} — Blue-pelt wolves that steam cold. \emph{Signs:} rime on tracks; breath that crackles. \emph{Hook:} warm milk poured on ice buys one unchallenged crossing.

\end{itemize}

4 & Frost-bitten stirrup: mount that wears it ignores ice once. \\
5 & Braid-bead of hostage glass; melts when a string is cut nearby. \\
6 & River-depth rod carved with safe counts for three fords. \\
7 & Iron hoof-bell that rings for liars at council. \\
8 & Bone-lot cup; roll it to name which feud clause applies. \\
9 & Wind-wrung scarf; pass it round to share breath in a white squall. \\
10 & Wolf-road tablet scrap; reads as \emph{Foedus Seal} to one clerk. \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Complication Twists (d8)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{White Squall} reveals a remount vault’s smoke hole; entering angers reed stalkers.
  \item \emph{Rasputitsa} exposes kurgan stones; riding around them starts a name-claim.
  \item \emph{Feud Spark} was staged by a salt-broker; paying in \emph{Salt Allotment} unmasks them.
  \item \emph{Hostage Call} is for a \emph{Safe-Hostage} you already carry—by another name.
  \item \emph{Grassfire} runs uphill toward a council hollow; smoke votes before riders do.
  \item \emph{Foedus Recall} cites a river you crossed yesterday—now it flows the other way.
  \item \emph{Raid Shadow} is your own tracks, mirrored by sky omens; choose which you admit.
  \item \emph{Kurultai Call} stacks councils; words spoken in one bind you in the other.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Mini-Procedures (quick steppe play)}
\paragraph{Wolf Road Etiquette}
When you arrive at a \emph{Trading Palisade} or \emph{Remount Station}, choose one and pay its price:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Salt First:} Spend \emph{Salt Allotment} to gain \emph{Market-Green} for the scene.
  \item \textbf{String First:} Place a \emph{Safe-Hostage} to bank +1 Position in all parleys here.
  \item \textbf{Story First:} Recount a true raid; cancel one \emph{Paper vs Spear} style objection.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Trial-Ride (three beats)}
\emph{Mark}, \emph{Loose}, \emph{Hold}.  
Win two beats (navigation shot, archery shot, nerve test) to claim verdict; each failed beat marks 1 Fatigue or 1 honor cost (your pick).

\subsection*{Adventure Seeds}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Strings in Winter} — Three hostage cords go missing from the String-Mother’s yard; each is tied to a different treaty you need.
  \item \textbf{Storm on Credit} — Storm-Singer Urum sells you \emph{Sky’s Exception}; someone else already owes the same storm.
  \item \textbf{Ledger of the Road} — A road-judge’s seal-book was buried in a dust hulk; opening it retitles the Wolf Mileposts for a day.
  \item \textbf{Feast of Two Standards} — A kurultai invites rival banners to dine under one ring; the first to eat salt owes the first blood—or peace.
\end{itemize}
