\section{Ykrul --- ``Wolf Standards, Winter Camps''}
\label{chap:ykrul}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
The Ykrul ride the endless steppe where horizon meets sky and law rides in saddlebags. Hosts gather by the thousand, yet break into fragments at a word; one night you share their fires, the next they test your bonds. Their banners are wolves' teeth, their treaties braided strings, their memory longer than the rivers that cross their roads.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:ykrul-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (passes/remounts/truces) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{steppe \& sky} motifs---wind that speaks, horses that remember, and treaties that bind across generations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hostage Strings:} Every oath secured with \textbf{hostage string}---token kin, retainer, sworn ally left in other camp. If deal broken, hostage's fate becomes story's next beat.
\item \textbf{Steppe Law:} Travelers bound by \textbf{steppe law}: hospitality lasts three nights, insults last three generations. Keeper may demand 1 SB when either law broken.
\item \textbf{Sky Omens:} When sky shows strange signs---mock-suns, green fire, thunder without storm---steppe itself speaks. Players may once per scene treat omen as Diamond, shifting position without roll.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Ykrul society, power flows through the careful management of hospitality, the binding of oaths with hostages, and the ability to navigate the complex web of tribal relationships. The Khagan maintains authority through the loyalty of noyans and the respect of khatuns, while local leaders wield influence through their control of resources like salt, remounts, and safe passage. The true power lies with those who understand the ancient customs and can maintain the delicate balance between hospitality and honor.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Ykrul society revolves around hospitality, hostage exchanges, and the ability to command respect from hosts and courts. Rewards often take the form of tokens, treaties, and official positions that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, braids, standards) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival hosts issue conflicting protections, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the camps, councils, and crossings as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of custom and honor determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Ykrul society, your word is your bond, and your bond determines whether you ride as guest or ghost.
