\chapter{Ykrul --- ``Wolf Standards, Winter Camps'' Generator}

\section*{Mapping}
\textbf{Spades} = Places; \textbf{Hearts} = People/Factions; \textbf{Clubs} = Complications/Threats; \textbf{Diamonds} = Rewards/Leverage. Draw until all four suits appear. Highest rank sets the primary clock (2--5$\Rightarrow$4 • 6--10$\Rightarrow$6 • J/Q/K$\Rightarrow$8 • A$\Rightarrow$10). Diamonds are \emph{codified outcomes}: play them to change position without a test.

\section*{\textbf{Spades} --- Places (steppe roads, winter rings, fords, cairns)}

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}

\item \textbf{River break-up}---ice goes; ferries don't.
\item[J] \textbf{Raid shadow}---another banner follows at a patient distance.

\item[A] \textbf{Sky's Exception}---once, the weather ignores you (storm, whiteout, dust).
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick Use Notes}
Draw until you have all four suits: \textbf{Spades}=place, \textbf{Hearts}=actor, \textbf{Clubs}=pressure, \textbf{Diamonds}=leverage. Highest rank sets the main clock (2--5$\Rightarrow$4 • 6--10$\Rightarrow$6 • J/Q/K$\Rightarrow$8 • A$\Rightarrow$10). If any \emph{A} appears, add a sky omen you can echo later (sun-dogs, silent thunder, a wind that runs beside the riders). When a \textbf{Diamond} is played, move the fiction---remounts appear, fords lower, banners part crowds---no roll.
