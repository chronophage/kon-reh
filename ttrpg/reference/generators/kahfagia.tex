\section*{Spades --- Places (western littorals, pilot-lanes, lantern law)}
\label{sec:kahfagia-places}

\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Tidal mudflat with a hidden plank-way at low water.

\end{enumerate}

\label{sec:kahfagia-people}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (tide, law, weather, blades)}
\label{sec:kahfagia-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Tide turns two bells early---grounding risk rises.
\item Smothering fog; sound travels, sight does not.
\item Harbor boom slams shut; wrong side of the chain.
\item ``The lights change'' mid-approach; your lane just moved.
\item Pilots strike over unpaid ``average''; no escorts available.
\item Surprise inspection; customs ladder audits your cargo and crew.

\item[J] Quartermaster sells your tide-tables to a rival.
\item[Q] Yellow flag---port quarantine; deadlines rot on the hook.
\item[K] Fleet redeploys; your ``safe'' corridor becomes a parade ground.
\item[A] Black squall at the Pointe scatters ships and stories.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (papers, rights, priority, favors)}
\label{sec:kahfagia-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Priority mooring chit (skip the Mooring Roll once).

\item Fee waiver on today's cargo; ledger smile included.
\item Safe-conduct along a specific beaconed lane.
\item Salvage rights on a named quay or reach.

\item[A] ``Move the lanterns'' license---temporary authority to redefine the lane.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:kahfagia-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Highest rank sets the primary Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4-seg, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6-seg, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8-seg, A $\rightarrow$ 10-seg).
\item Treat Diamonds as position-changers and codified outcomes (licenses, charters, rights)---don't roll them.
\item If your draw comes up all red or all black, remember the SRD's tone and free-SB nudges.
\item If any A appears, echo sea \& signal motifs---beacons that migrate, tides that remember, and law that flows like water.
\end{itemize}
