\section{Kahfagia --- ``Pilot's Mirror'' Generator}
\label{chap:kahfagia}

Kahfagia is the western hinge of the Amaranthine: a thalassocracy of pilots, factors, and admirals who alone control the lanes to the Great Western Sea. By lantern-law and mirror-signal, they enforce their hegemony, restricting neighbors to inward seas while they slip beyond to distant markets and stranger shores. Kahfagia is no empire of land, but of water, light, and ledgers---and no rival survives long if the beacons are moved against them.

\section*{Spades --- Places (western littorals, pilot-lanes, lantern law)}
\label{sec:kahfagia-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Tidal mudflat with a hidden plank-way at low water.
\item Salt-scar pier behind the dawn spice auctions.
\item Reedbelt smuggler creeks where tax boats won't follow.
\item Breakwater under repair; gap lets cutters slip at dusk.
\item Freshly dredged channel with temporary beacons.
\item River sluice and tide-gate; boom-chain across the mouth.
\item Narrow-keel cutter yard, apprentices on night shift.
\item Fog-lane ``lantern alley'' where beacons migrate with the tide.
\item Admiralty quay and bonded warehouses under seal.
\item[J] The Red Shoal rendezvous---quiet water, loud reputations.
\item[Q] Mirror-Light Tower (pilot station) that certifies safe water---today.
\item[K] Kassamira presidial port: auctions at dawn, courts by noon.
\item[A] ``The Pointe'' strait---storm-lights and wreckers' tales.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (pilots, corsairs, admiralty hands)}
\label{sec:kahfagia-people}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (tide, law, weather, blades)}
\label{sec:kahfagia-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Tide turns two bells early---grounding risk rises.
\item Smothering fog; sound travels, sight does not.
\item Harbor boom slams shut; wrong side of the chain.
\item ``The lights change'' mid-approach; your lane just moved.

\item Dredging grant (you decide where the next channel runs).
\item Letter of marque/convoy for one season.
\item[J] Admiralty judgment in your favor; precedent travels with you.
\item[Q] Mirror-Light Warrant---the legal right to post a beacon.
\item[K] A share in the spice auction floor at Kassamira.
\item[A] ``Move the lanterns'' license---temporary authority to redefine the lane.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:kahfagia-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Highest rank sets the primary Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4-seg, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6-seg, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8-seg, A $\rightarrow$ 10-seg).
\item Treat Diamonds as position-changers and codified outcomes (licenses, charters, rights)---don't roll them.
\item If your draw comes up all red or all black, remember the SRD's tone and free-SB nudges.
\item If any A appears, echo sea \& signal motifs---beacons that migrate, tides that remember, and law that flows like water.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pilot’s Mirror:} Kahfagia’s strength is not its fleet, but its monopoly on light and lane. To post a beacon is to redraw the map.
\item \textbf{Oligarchic Rule:} Families rule by shares in ports and auctions; politics is brokerage in ledgers and lanterns.
\item \textbf{Western Reach:} Kahfagian captains boast of ports ``beyond the mirror,’’ bringing rumors, goods, and curses the Amaranthine can scarcely name.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Rumors of the Western Trade}
\label{sec:kahfagia-rumors}

Kahfagia’s captains boast of ports beyond the mirror, where the Amaranthine ends and stranger waters begin. Most claim these are sailor’s lies—until their cargo alters dinner tables, prayers, or the soil beneath one’s feet.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \index{Apple of the Earth} ``Apple of the Earth’’: a knobbly root that grows in poor soils. Peasants whisper it thrives where grain fails, but priests mutter it is too hearty—plants should not yield so much.
\item The \index{Goose} ``Goose’’: a feathered bird with wattled throat and proud tail. No hunter swears they have seen it outside Kahfagian docks. Nobles crave its flesh, yet swear its eyes hold too much thought.
\item The \index{Great Corn} ``Great Corn’’: towering grass with ears like clustered gold. Villagers plant it along old rites and swear the stalks hum at dusk.
\item The \index{Redshade} ``Redshade’’ fruit: glossy, blood-red bulbs. Healers argue if it nourishes or poisons. Lovers tie charms with its skins for luck—or revenge.
\item Sailors swear of a port where the bells ring backward and tides obey them. A mirror is polished before every departure, lest the water mistake them for strangers.
\item ``West of the West’’ lies a coast of glass beaches, where bones are lighter than driftwood and float in tidepools like shells.
\item A caravan master in Kassamira sells cloth dyed in hues no dyer will admit to mixing—``storm-blue,’’ ``death’s green,’’ and ``mirror-grey.’’ The bolts reek faintly of salt even when dry.
\item A spice known as ``fire-salt’’ smokes when sprinkled on stew. Some say it burns spirits away. Others say it draws them nearer.
\item An admiral’s son wears a feather cloak that sheds no water, though the bird that bore it is unknown to any bestiary.
\item There is a law in Kahfagia forbidding the mention of a certain island’s name; pilots drink salt-wine in silence when pressed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Using the Rumors}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each rumor is half-truth: if you seed one into play, decide whether it is miraculous, mundane, or monstrous.
\item Treat Kahfagia’s “Other Lands” as unreachable by any but their pilots—unless the PCs find a way to break the monopoly.
\item Rumors can act as rewards (a strange food, a rare feather) or as complications (tainted crops, curses spread by feast).
