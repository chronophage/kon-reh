\section*{Quick use notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Highest rank sets the primary Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4-seg, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6-seg, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8-seg, A $\rightarrow$ 10-seg).
\item Treat Diamonds as position-changers and codified outcomes (licenses, charters, rights)---don't roll them.
\item If your draw comes up all red or all black, remember the SRD's tone and free-CP nudges.
\end{itemize}
