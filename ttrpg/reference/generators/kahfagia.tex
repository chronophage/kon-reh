\section{Kahfagia --- ``Pilot's Mirror''}
\label{chap:kahfagia}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Kahfagia is the western hinge of the Amaranthine: a thalassocracy of pilots, factors, and admirals who alone control the lanes to the Great Western Sea. By lantern-law and mirror-signal, they enforce their hegemony, restricting neighbors to inward seas while they slip beyond to distant markets and stranger shores. Kahfagia is no empire of land, but of water, light, and ledgers---and no rival survives long if the beacons are moved against them.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:kahfagia-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (papers/rights/priority) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{sea \& signal} motifs---beacons that migrate, tides that remember, and law that flows like water.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pilot's Mirror:} Kahfagia's strength is not fleet but monopoly on light and lane. To post beacon is to redraw map.
\item \textbf{Oligarchic Rule:} Families rule by shares in ports and auctions; politics is brokerage in ledgers and lanterns.
\item \textbf{Western Reach:} Captains boast of ports ``beyond mirror,'' bringing rumors, goods, and curses Amaranthine can scarcely name.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Kahfagia, power flows through control of the sea lanes themselves. The maritime oligarchs have built their empire not through conquest of territory but through mastery of navigation. Every beacon, every channel marker, every mirror-light is both a navigational aid and a legal instrument. To control the lights is to control the sea, and to control the sea is to control the destiny of nations. 

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Kahfagian patronage revolves around access---to channels, to cargo, to legal protection. Rewards often take the form of pilotage tokens, safe-conducts, or salvage rights that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (beacons, writs, lantern codes) that can be challenged, moved, or voided.
\item Let rival admirals issue conflicting safe-conducts, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the Admiralty courts and spice auctions as arenas for social contests, where legal maneuvering determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Kahfagia, your route is your rank, and your rank determines your right to passage.

\subsection*{Kahfagia — Salt Thrones and Tide Courts}
\textbf{Starting Location:} The Lantern Pier admiralty chapel, where votive ships hang from the ceiling and brine drips from the icon of a drowned saint.

\begin{quote}
“In Kahfagia, law rides the tide: debts are weighed at high water, mercy at the ebb.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Sea‑Notary unlocks a salt‑stained reliquary and produces a chart with gilt edges. “By writ of the Tide Court,” she says, “the Red Current owes tithe and penance. Fetch the contraband bell from the corsair galleass \emph{Santa Dolorosa} before moonrise—or the harbor names you accomplices.”

\paragraph{Motifs} Admiralty chapels, corsair charters, tiled courts, incense and tar, salt pans, drowned‑saint relics, cofradía oaths, lantern fleets.
\paragraph{Whispers} Drink from the captain’s chalice; Spare the corsair who kneels; Let the tide take the debtor’s breath.
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: \emph{Corsair Retaliation}; Community: \emph{Harbor Unrest}; Anchor: \emph{Cofradía Peace}; Fracture (optional): \emph{Bell Wakes the Sea}.
\paragraph{Complications} Pilgrims crowd the pier; the bell tolls underwater; harbor chains rise on their own; the Sea‑Notary’s seal appears on a rival’s papers.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A dockside confraternity that shelters the PCs; a lighthouse keeper cousin; a merchant’s pledge held against a PC’s kin.
\paragraph{Escalation} The drowned saint’s icon weeps seawater that spells a PC’s family name across the tiles.
\paragraph{Relief} Return the bell to neutral altar and publicly renounce profit (reduce Community by one); present a corsair captain’s confession to the Tide Court (advance Threat back by one); spend 2 \Boons{} to “buy the tide” for a scene—harbor chains lower, patrols thin, and witnesses look away.
