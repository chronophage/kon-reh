\section{Kahfagia --- ``Pilot's Mirror''}
\label{chap:kahfagia}

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Admiral of Lantern-Law (Elite):}  
  ``Every mirror is a blade, every beacon a promise. The sea itself obeys when we move the lights — and woe to the fool who rows against them.''
  \end{quote}
  
  \begin{quote}
  \textbf{Dockside Factor (Commoner):}  
  ``The pilots see farther than kings or priests. A gesture in lantern-code can open ports, or close them. So keep your debts paid, and your lamps trimmed.''
  \end{quote}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Kahfagia is the western hinge of the Amaranthine: a thalassocracy of pilots, factors, and admirals who alone control the lanes to the Great Western Sea. By lantern-law and mirror-signal, they enforce their hegemony, restricting neighbors to inward seas while they slip beyond to distant markets and stranger shores. Kahfagia is no empire of land, but of water, light, and ledgers---and no rival survives long if the beacons are moved against them.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:kahfagia-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (papers/rights/priority) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{sea \& signal} motifs---beacons that migrate, tides that remember, and law that flows like water.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pilot's Mirror:} Kahfagia's strength is not fleet but monopoly on light and lane. To post beacon is to redraw map.
\item \textbf{Oligarchic Rule:} Families rule by shares in ports and auctions; politics is brokerage in ledgers and lanterns.
\item \textbf{Western Reach:} Captains boast of ports ``beyond mirror,'' bringing rumors, goods, and curses Amaranthine can scarcely name.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Kahfagia, power flows through control of the sea lanes themselves. The maritime oligarchs have built their empire not through conquest of territory but through mastery of navigation. Every beacon, every channel marker, every mirror-light is both a navigational aid and a legal instrument. To control the lights is to control the sea, and to control the sea is to control the destiny of nations. 

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Kahfagian patronage revolves around access---to channels, to cargo, to legal protection. Rewards often take the form of pilotage tokens, safe-conducts, or salvage rights that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (beacons, writs, lantern codes) that can be challenged, moved, or voided.
\item Let rival admirals issue conflicting safe-conducts, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the Admiralty courts and spice auctions as arenas for social contests, where legal maneuvering determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Kahfagia, your route is your rank, and your rank determines your right to passage.

\item \textbf{Condition Applied:} Mark \textbf{Fatigue 1/Harm 1/Condition} appropriate to fiction.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Narrative Pivot:} The story takes an unexpected turn that reframes objectives.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Kahfagia (Lantern Law):} Beacons shift without warning, writs expire mid-sentence, jurisdiction flips underfoot.
\item \textbf{Kahfagia (Western Trade):} Strange cargo manifests, foreign spices bloom in wounds, rumors prove true.
\item \textbf{Kahfagia (Tide Masters):} Channels silt overnight, tides run backward, anchors refuse to hold.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Kahfagia — Salt Thrones and Tide Courts}
\textbf{Starting Location:} The Lantern Pier admiralty chapel, where votive ships hang from the ceiling and brine drips from the icon of a drowned saint.

\begin{quote}
“In Kahfagia, law rides the tide: debts are weighed at high water, mercy at the ebb.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Sea‑Notary unlocks a salt‑stained reliquary and produces a chart with gilt edges. “By writ of the Tide Court,” she says, “the Red Current owes tithe and penance. Fetch the contraband bell from the corsair galleass \emph{Santa Dolorosa} before moonrise—or the harbor names you accomplices.”

\paragraph{Motifs} Admiralty chapels, corsair charters, tiled courts, incense and tar, salt pans, drowned‑saint relics, cofradía oaths, lantern fleets.
\paragraph{Whispers} Drink from the captain’s chalice; Spare the corsair who kneels; Let the tide take the debtor’s breath.
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: \emph{Corsair Retaliation}; Community: \emph{Harbor Unrest}; Anchor: \emph{Cofradía Peace}; Fracture (optional): \emph{Bell Wakes the Sea}.
\paragraph{Complications} Pilgrims crowd the pier; the bell tolls underwater; harbor chains rise on their own; the Sea‑Notary’s seal appears on a rival’s papers.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A dockside confraternity that shelters the PCs; a lighthouse keeper cousin; a merchant’s pledge held against a PC’s kin.
\paragraph{Escalation} The drowned saint’s icon weeps seawater that spells a PC’s family name across the tiles.
\paragraph{Relief} Return the bell to neutral altar and publicly renounce profit (reduce Community by one); present a corsair captain’s confession to the Tide Court (advance Threat back by one); spend 2 \Boons{} to “buy the tide” for a scene—harbor chains lower, patrols thin, and witnesses look away.
% ====== KAHFAGIA: PLUG-IN EXTENSIONS (SEA & SIGNAL HEGEMONY) ======

\subsection*{Extensions (Plug-in)}
\label{sec:kahfagia-extensions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cross-Region Hooks (optional draws):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Mirror Convoy} requests you escort a foreign barge through a disputed inlet; accept to downgrade \emph{Jurisdiction Flip} once, but start \emph{Diplomatic Ripples} [4].
    \item \emph{Harbor Missionaries of Lantern-Law} establish a pilot shrine upriver; local rulers bristle, giving +1 Position on Kahfagia courts, -1 with that realm’s officials.
    \item \emph{Quiet Blacklist:} A distant port’s beacon-codes “forget” your patron; treat its approaches as \emph{Smothering Fog} until you secure a \emph{Mirror Warrant}.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Faction Entanglements During Travel (use en route or on approach):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Holding any \emph{Letter of Marque} bumps \emph{Customs Inspection} by +1 segment (privateers breed paperwork), but grants +1 Effect against \emph{Reef-Runners}.
    \item Carrying a rival oligarch’s seal advances \emph{Pilot Strike} once (no one wants that job), unless you spend a \emph{Mooring Chit}.
    \item Displaying \emph{Safe-Conduct} along a beaconed lane ignores the first \emph{Boom Slam} this session; if used to cut a queue, tick \emph{Dock Unrest} [4].
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Patron Touchpoints (drop the ones you like):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Maelstraeus (Ledger of Tides):} Once/session convert a social success at dockside into a \emph{Fee Waiver} Diamond; begin \emph{Karmic Tariff} [6].
    \item \textbf{The Traveler (Way of Water):} Spend 1 Boon to treat a fog-bank as a \emph{Marked Path}: +1 die to navigation; on a miss, \emph{Light Shift} advances.
    \item \textbf{The Sealed Gate (Closed Lanes):} Sanctify a boom-chain as a temporary [\textsc{Ward}]; enemies resist with Spirit+Resolve (DV 4). When it lifts, mark \emph{Backed-Up Harbor} [4].
    \item \textbf{Lunara (Witchlight at Sea):} Moonlit sounding lets you ask one yes/no about a hidden channel; mark Exposure +1 as the \emph{Mirror Tower} takes notice.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Trade Good Consequences (pick 1 when a haul lands):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Spice Flood} $\rightarrow$ prices crash $\rightarrow$ downgrade one \emph{Pilot Strike} (everyone wants the overtime), but tick \emph{Oligarch Feud} [4].
    \item \emph{Contraband Bell/Relic} $\rightarrow$ advance \emph{Yellow Flag}; or surrender it for a \emph{Lantern License}.
    \item \emph{Salvaged Charts} $\rightarrow$ gain \emph{Lantern Code}; start \emph{Chart Dispute} [4] with a Mirror-Keeper.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Harbor Favor (minor currency):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Earn by resolving dock conflicts without bloodshed, or returning wrecked gear tagged to the Admiralty.
    \item Spend 1 to reduce DV of pilotage/inspection by 1, or to step past one \emph{Customs Inspection} queue.
    \item Holding 2+ paints a target: begin \emph{Oligarch Attention} [4]; when it fills, a magnate “offers” partnership.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Reputation Echoes (soft power on the water):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Admiralty-Backed:} Ignore the first \emph{Jurisdiction Flip} per session; next flip returns at +1 severity.
    \item \emph{Trusted Pilot:} Once/session set Position one step safer on \emph{Breakwater Gap}/\emph{Dredged Channel}.
    \item \emph{Oligarch-Tied:} +1 Effect on auctions at \emph{Kassamira Port}; \emph{Pilot Strike} starts at +1 when their rivals run the quay.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Signal Geometry (infrastructure with teeth)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Beacon Leverage:} Controlling a \emph{Mirror Tower} grants a one-scene \emph{lane control} tag: shift one ship conflict to your preferred range; if abused, \emph{Fleet Redeploy} advances.
  \item \textbf{Chains \& Courts:} Raising harbor chains grants +1 Position to allies in the roadstead; on failure, trigger \emph{Boom Slam} and tick \emph{Harbor Unrest}.
  \item \textbf{Fog Acoustics:} On \emph{Smothering Fog}, a successful hail grants an extra assist die; on a miss, your call is triangulated—\emph{Customs Inspection} enters play.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Naval Intelligence Layer (the Lantern Office)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item At scene start in sensitive waters, roll 1d6:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Signal Audit:} lantern clerks board; reveal one forged paper or owe a favor.
    \item \emph{Shadow Tow:} an unmarked cutter mirrors your course; +1 Heat if you change plan.
    \item \emph{Sting Ledger:} a factor pays over market to mark your cargo for tracing.
    \item \emph{Whisper List:} rival oligarch denounced; gain +1 Position vs.\ their assets this scene.
    \item \emph{Pilot Swap:} your pilot is reassigned; choose delay \emph{or} accept a loyal but green apprentice (-1 die once).
    \item \emph{False Quarantine:} Yellow Flag raised on rumor; spend \emph{Harbor Favor} or fight it in Tide Court.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Plug-in SB Conversions (Kahfagia flavor)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Any 1 SB may become \emph{Wake Surge}: currents shove positions one range band; choose who benefits.
  \item Any 2 SB may become \emph{Light Swap}: a beacon shifts—advance or negate \emph{Light Shift} once.
  \item On 3+ SB offer \emph{Admiralty Summons}: accept a visible mark (paint, pennant) to halve consequences; begin \emph{Court Obligation} [6].
\end{itemize}

% --- MINI-PROCEDURE: LANTERN-CODE CHECKS ---
\subsection*{Lantern-Code Etiquette (1-minute table use)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Declare Channel:} Near, Mid, or Far (\emph{range sets DV 3/4/5}).
  \item \textbf{Signal:} Roll \emph{Performance + Sail} or \emph{Wits + Sail} vs.\ DV. \emph{Assist} if another reads mirrors.
  \item \textbf{On a Hit:} \emph{Pick one}: +1 Position, or cancel the first \emph{Light Shift} this scene.
  \item \textbf{On a Miss:} Keeper may convert 1 SB to \emph{Jurisdiction Flip} or spawn a \emph{Shadow Tow}.
\end{enumerate}

% --- MICRO TRIAL: TIDE COURT HEARING ---
\subsection*{Tide Court in Session (3 beats, fast)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Motion \& Merit:} Name the grievance in one line (cargo, corridor, quarantine). Roll \emph{Lore + Society} vs.\ DV 4 to be heard today.
  \item \textbf{Proofs:} Offer any two: chart, beacon-log, pilot testimony, cargo manifest. Each success: reduce opposing DV by 1 or bank 1 \emph{Harbor Favor}.
  \item \textbf{Judgment (1d6):} 1–2 Delay; 3–4 Fee; 5 Precedent (\emph{Admiralty Judgment}); 6 Lantern Mark (\emph{Mirror Warrant (temporary)}). If \emph{Harbor Unrest} $\geq$ 3, --1 to the roll.
\end{enumerate}

% --- QUICK TABLES ---
\subsection*{Western Reach Rumors (d6, fast hooks)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A harbor where bells toll under water; cargo \emph{must} be named aloud.
  \item A spice that stops bleeding—until moonrise.
  \item A mirror-reef that reflects storms from a week ahead.
  \item A pilotage guild that uses birds, not beacons.
  \item A fleet that sails by \emph{shadow} cast on fog.
  \item A court that weighs debts in \emph{breath}, not coin.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Sea Superstitions (burn for +1 die once)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Bread to the Wake:} Toss a crust; ignore the first \emph{Smothering Fog} penalty.
  \item \textbf{Turn the Lantern:} Spin the binnacle lamp once; cancel \emph{Boom Slam} or take --1 die next pilot check (your choice).
  \item \textbf{Name to the Deep:} Whisper a true name; gain +1 Effect vs.\ corsairs, mark \emph{Obligation} to the Tide Court.
\end{itemize}

% --- SHIP CONFLICT: SIMPLE RANGE LADDER ---
\subsection*{Pursuit Ladder (Near/Mid/Far)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Advance/Withdraw (Sail + Wits):} On a hit, shift one band. On a strong hit, also impose \emph{Wake Surge}.
  \item \textbf{Cut the Lane (Pilot + Tactics):} On a hit, freeze range for one exchange; if a beacon is under your color, +1 die.
  \item \textbf{Weather the Squall (Resolve + Sail):} On a hit in \emph{Black Squall}, you pick who drifts; on a miss, Keeper does.
\end{itemize}

% --- BOSSES (SEEDS) ---
\subsection*{Boss Seeds (Sea \& Signal)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Mirror-Keeper of Kassamira} (signal tyrant): \emph{Phases}—Audit $\rightarrow$ Blacklist $\rightarrow$ Light Embargo. Counters: rival beacon logs, Tide Court precedent, stolen codebook.
  \item \textbf{Corsair-Chaplain of the Pointe} (relic raider): \emph{Phases}—Charm $\rightarrow$ Board $\rightarrow$ Bell-Wake. Counters: sanctified boom, cofradía oath, drowned-saint tithe.
\end{itemize}

% --- A FEW EXTRA DIAMONDS ---
\subsection*{Supplemental Diamonds}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{13}
  \item \textbf{Pilot’s Oath-Bead} --- One sworn escort ignores \emph{Early Tide} this leg.
  \item \textbf{Court Delay Writ} --- Quarantine holds but \emph{your} manifest clears.
  \item \textbf{Fog Charter} --- Treat one \emph{Smothering Fog} scene as if beaconed (+1 Position once).
