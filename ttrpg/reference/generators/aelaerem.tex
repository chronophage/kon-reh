\section{Aelaerem (Halflings) --- ``Hearth \& Hollow''}
\label{chap:aelaerem}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Hearth \& Hollow}]
The Aelaerem keep their bargains with bread, bells, and careful counting. Lanes run under ash and hawthorn; doors reddened with thread promise a seat and a story to any who step right. Their magic is housekeeping writ large---tidings tended, names jarred like jam, thresholds groomed so the \emph{Neighbors} pass by without offense. When the Hollow stirs beneath the barrows and burrows, the folk answer with kettle songs and lantern law, and the fields behave themselves because someone asked them to.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Spades --- Places (lanes, orchards, mills, downs, barrows)}
\label{sec:aelaerem-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item (Memory/Nostalgia) Willow ford with flat stones and a bowed pollard that remembers faces.
\item (Work/Tradition) Cider-press barn; sweet reek, flies, old songs, doors that stick after dusk.
\item (Pastoral/Order) Chalk sheep-downs with a turf maze cut like a wheel.
\item (Mystery/Watchfulness) Millpond under alders; the wheel turns some nights without water.
\item (Hunting/Preparation) Bluebell wood path; rabbit-gates and snares set by careful hands.
\item (Transition/Safety) Hedge-tunnel lane between fields; nine stiles locals count ``eight-and-one.''
\item (Offering/Exchange) Cup-mark stone on the verge; butter left in niches goes missing kindly.
\item (Sacred/Quiet) Barrow-by-the-beech where bees go quiet at noon.
\item (Community/Gathering) Market green with maypole and stocks; carved village stones turned inward.
\item[J] (Vigilance/Observation) Dovecote hill; the scarecrow faces the road, not the rows.
\item[Q] (Magic/Deception) Mother's Orchard; rows straighten if you don't look---curve if you do.
\item[K] (Justice/Tradition) Moot Oak with lantern nails hammered deep and benches at the roots.
\item[A] (Otherworld/Futility) Hollow Field, a ring where no plow will hold a line, not for any coin.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (keepers, elders, mummers, quiet powers)}
\label{sec:aelaerem-people}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item (Healing/Wisdom) Hedge-witch midwife who ties red thread and unties feuds.
\item (Protection/Watchfulness) Miller and his watch-geese---better sentries than men.
\item (Authority/Organization) Orchard reeve with a tally-stick and a cider-stained smile.
\item (Sacred/Secret) Beekeeper; keeps odd honey aside for ``winter churches.''
\item (Magic/Connection) Shepherd with a bone whistle that calls dogs---and other things.
\item (Vigilance/Knowledge) Lantern-warden who trims lamps and knows which shadow is wrong.
\item (Performance/Tradition) Mummers' captain with a chest of masks and stricter rules than church.
\item (Travel/Binding) Traveling tinker with bright kettles and a dull knife for cutting oaths.
\item (Authority/Severity) Bailiff of the Moot Oak, as polite as a noose.
\item[J] (Tradition/Wisdom) Wold-Wardens, elders who swear by hedges, not crowns.
\item[Q] (Hospitality/Power) Apple-Matron, hostess of harvest feasts; power sits where she pours.
\item[K] (Seasonal Authority/Ritual) Thresher-King in harvest robes: a title that moves but never leaves.
\item[A] (Mystery/Protection) The Pale Shepherd---comes when lambs are born and when people go missing.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (folk omens, rites, beasts, night)}
\label{sec:aelaerem-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item (Confusion/Disorientation) Unseasonal fog; the road walks you back to your own gate.
\item (Omen/Warning) Scarecrow turns; it watches the lane, not the field.
\item (Curse/Revelation) Soured wassail; the bowl gives back names you did not speak.
\item (Threat/Disruption) Black sow through the orchard; hooves scuff every charm.
\item (Chaos/Nature) Hive-swarm at dusk; smoke curls the wrong way.
\item (Memory/Tradition) Old song taken up by children; adults remember the verse none should sing.
\item (Supernatural/Cost) Lanterns burn blue at the ford; crossing costs more than coin.
\item (Disguise/Transformation) Out-of-season mumming; masks stick---faces won't.
\item (Mystery/Loss) Chalk maze fills with mist; you step out somewhere older.
\item[J] (Sacred/Intervention) Church bell rings thirteen; something attends the sermon.
\item[Q] (Demand/Seasonal) Harvest tithe demanded by hands gloved in leaves.
\item[K] (Violence/Corruption) Moot Oak bleeds sap the color of wine; talk turns to knives.
\item[A] (Otherworld/Invasion) The Hollow opens; burrows and barrows connect, and footfalls answer underground.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (blessings, tokens, host-rights, exceptions)}
\label{sec:aelaerem-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item (Hospitality/Protection) Guest-loaf \& salt---one night's safe board anywhere with a red door.
\item (Community/Social) Cider-mark---a free cup on the green buys gossip and patience.
\item (Magic/Movement) Hedge-pass ribbon---step through any thicket unsnagged, once.
\item (Nature/Warning) Bee-queen share---honey and warning from the hives when danger nears.
\item (Protection/Control) Shepherd's whistle---dogs and door-bolts heed you for one scene.

\item (Social License/Freedom) Mummers' license---lawful mask and after-dark crossing for a feast day.
\item (Magic/Truth) Orchard right---pick at Mother's Orchard without offense; fruit hides a truth.

\item[J] (Blessing/Help) Apple-Matron's blessing---hands help unseen when you ask no coin.
\item[Q] (Justice/Privacy) Private moot under the Oak; elders hear you alone, precedent sticks.
\item[K] (Protection/Authority) Thresher-King's guard---six red-hooded harvesters escort you; doors open.
\item[A] (Otherworld/Invisibility) Pale Shepherd's clause---once, the Hollow will not notice you; pass uncounted.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:aelaerem-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (blessings/tokens/host-rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo Hearth \& Hollow motifs---quiet bells, red thread, watch-geese, footsteps under the soil---so the dread feels woven through the hedges.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bread \& Lantern:} Presenting guest-loaf and a lit lantern at a threshold shifts your next social action one step safer while you remain a guest of that hearth.
\item \textbf{Neighborly Courtesies:} When you keep local taboos (count ``eight-and-one,'' turn village stones inward, leave butter at cup-marks), cancel the first SB generated by rites or negotiations in that scene.
\item \textbf{Listen at the Stile:} A quiet pause at a stile, barrow, or hedge-tunnel yields a true omen---ask one short question about what the Hollow wants \emph{here and now}; the answer arrives as a sign, sound, or small animal.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Hearth Magic}]
The Aelaerem weave their power through careful observance and small courtesies. Their magic lies not in grand gestures but in the precise attention to thresholds, seasons, and the proper ordering of things. Red thread binds more than wounds---it ties names to places, promises to people, and the living to the Hollow that walks beneath their feet. To offend a hedge-witch is to invite the Neighbors' attention; to earn an elder's blessing is to walk with the earth's favor.

\item \textbf{Aelaerem (Folk Customs):} You forget a crucial local taboo and offend the Neighbors; small things begin to go wrong
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Aelaerem — Strangers Hired for a Job}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A cider‑press barn perfumed with crushed apples and rain, where masks hang from beams awaiting the next festival.
\begin{quote}
"Among the Aelaerem, the orchards speak in riddles, and the harvest always demands its tithe in secrets.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A cider-press barn, the Apple-Matron watches as the party is ushered in by a mummer-captain. ``The Moot Oak bleeds wine,'' she says. ``Will you speak for the field, or let the Neighbors claim it?''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Harvest rites, masks and mummers, orchard wards, hospitality law.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Eat before asking,'' ``Dance the wrong step,'' ``Take the mask off the child.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Neighbors Cross the Hedge''; Fracture: ``The Oak Drinks''; Community: ``Shunning Begins.''
\paragraph{Complications} Masks swap faces; a ward demands a secret; cider turns to blood when questioned.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A PC’s host-family; the Matron’s heirloom press.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The Oak speaks with a PC’s voice.
\paragraph{Relief} Restore hospitality with a gift and truth; bury the mask at crossroads; share a feast to reduce Community by one.
