\chapter{Aelaerem (Halflings)--- ``Hearth \& Hollow'' Generator}
\label{chap:aelaerem}

\section*{Spades --- Places (lanes, orchards, mills, downs, barrows)}
\label{sec:aelaerem-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Willow ford with flat stones and a bowed pollard that remembers faces.
\item Cider-press barn; sweet reek, flies, old songs, doors that stick after dusk.
\item Chalk sheep-downs with a turf maze cut like a wheel.
\item Millpond under alders; the wheel turns some nights without water.
\item Bluebell wood path; rabbit-gates and snares set by careful hands.
\item Hedge-tunnel lane between fields; nine stiles locals count ``eight-and-one.''
\item Cup-mark stone on the verge; butter left in niches goes missing kindly.
\item Barrow-by-the-beech where bees go quiet at noon.
\item Market green with maypole and stocks; carved village stones turned inward.
\item[J] Dovecote hill; the scarecrow faces the road, not the rows.
\item[Q] Mother's Orchard; rows straighten if you don't look---curve if you do.
\item[K] Moot Oak with lantern nails hammered deep and benches at the roots.
\item[A] Hollow Field, a ring where no plow will hold a line, not for any coin.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (keepers, elders, mummers, quiet powers)}
\label{sec:aelaerem-people}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Hedge-witch midwife who ties red thread and unties feuds.
\item Miller and his watch-geese---better sentries than men.
\item Orchard reeve with a tally-stick and a cider-stained smile.
\item Beekeeper; keeps odd honey aside for ``winter churches.''
\item Shepherd with a bone whistle that calls dogs---and other things.
\item Lantern-warden who trims lamps and knows which shadow is wrong.
\item Mummers' captain with a chest of masks and stricter rules than church.
\item Traveling tinker with bright kettles and a dull knife for cutting oaths.
\item Bailiff of the Moot Oak, as polite as a noose.
\item[J] Wold-Wardens, elders who swear by hedges, not crowns.
\item[Q] Apple-Matron, hostess of harvest feasts; power sits where she pours.
\item[K] Thresher-King in harvest robes: a title that moves but never leaves.
\item[A] The Pale Shepherd---comes when lambs are born and when people go missing.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (folk omens, rites, beasts, night)}
\label{sec:aelaerem-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Unseasonal fog; the road walks you back to your own gate.
\item Scarecrow turns; it watches the lane, not the field.
\item Soured wassail; the bowl gives back names you did not speak.
\item Black sow through the orchard; hooves scuff every charm.
\item Hive-swarm at dusk; smoke curls the wrong way.
\item Old song taken up by children; adults remember the verse none should sing.
\item Lanterns burn blue at the ford; crossing costs more than coin.
\item Out-of-season mumming; masks stick---faces won't.
\item Chalk maze fills with mist; you step out somewhere older.
\item[J] Church bell rings thirteen; something attends the sermon.
\item[Q] Harvest tithe demanded by hands gloved in leaves.
\item[K] Moot Oak bleeds sap the color of wine; talk turns to knives.
\item[A] The Hollow opens; burrows and barrows connect, and footfalls answer underground.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (blessings, tokens, host-rights, exceptions)}
\label{sec:aelaerem-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Guest-loaf \& salt---one night's safe board anywhere with a red door.
\item Cider-mark---a free cup on the green buys gossip and patience.
\item Hedge-pass ribbon---step through any thicket unsnagged, once.
\item Bee-queen share---honey and warning from the hives when danger nears.
\item Shepherd's whistle---dogs and door-bolts heed you for one scene.
\item Lantern-writ---the lamps stay lit along your path despite wind.
\item Mummers' license---lawful mask and after-dark crossing for a feast day.
\item Orchard right---pick at Mother's Orchard without offense; fruit hides a truth.
\item Mill token---the wheel turns at any hour, grain or rumor ground.
\item[J] Apple-Matron's blessing---hands help unseen when you ask no coin.
\item[Q] Private moot under the Oak; elders hear you alone, precedent sticks.
\item[K] Thresher-King's guard---six red-hooded harvesters escort you; doors open.
\item[A] Pale Shepherd's clause---once, the Hollow will not notice you; pass uncounted.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:aelaerem-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (blessings/tokens/host-rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo Hearth \& Hollow motifs---quiet bells, red thread, watch-geese, footsteps under the soil---so the dread feels woven through the hedges.
\end{itemize}
