\section{Aelaerem (Halflings) --- ``Hearth \& Hollow''}
\label{chap:aelaerem}

\subsection*{Elite (Apple-Matron)}
\textit{``A proper harvest feast requires three things: the finest cider aged in the right barrel, a guest-loaf baked with intention, and the wisdom to know when to invite the quiet ones to sit by the fire.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Miller and his watch-geese)}
\textit{``My geese know a stranger's step from a mile off, and they've never been wrong. If they start honking at noon, you best check your larder – someone's coming who wasn't invited.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Hearth \& Hollow}]
In Amedell, he Aelaerem keep their bargains with bread, bells, and careful counting. Lanes run under ash and hawthorn; doors reddened with thread promise a seat and a story to any who step right. Their magic is housekeeping writ large---tidings tended, names jarred like jam, thresholds groomed so the \emph{Neighbors} pass by without offense. When the Hollow stirs beneath the barrows and burrows, the folk answer with kettle songs and lantern law, and the fields behave themselves because someone asked them to.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Spades --- Places (lanes, orchards, mills, downs, barrows)}

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (folk omens, rites, beasts, night)}
\label{sec:aelaerem-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item (Confusion/Disorientation) Unseasonal fog; the road walks you back to your own gate.
\item (Omen/Warning) Scarecrow turns; it watches the lane, not the field.
\item (Curse/Revelation) Soured wassail; the bowl gives back names you did not speak.
\item (Threat/Disruption) Black sow through the orchard; hooves scuff every charm.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item (Hospitality/Protection) Guest-loaf \& salt---one night's safe board anywhere with a red door.

\item (Social License/Freedom) Mummers' license---lawful mask and after-dark crossing for a feast day.
\item (Magic/Truth) Orchard right---pick at Mother's Orchard without offense; fruit hides a truth.

\item[J] (Blessing/Help) Apple-Matron's blessing---hands help unseen when you ask no coin.
\item[Q] (Justice/Privacy) Private moot under the Oak; elders hear you alone, precedent sticks.
\item[K] (Protection/Authority) Thresher-King's guard---six red-hooded harvesters escort you; doors open.
\item[A] (Otherworld/Invisibility) Pale Shepherd's clause---once, the Hollow will not notice you; pass uncounted.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:aelaerem-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (blessings/tokens/host-rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo Hearth \& Hollow motifs---quiet bells, red thread, watch-geese, footsteps under the soil---so the dread feels woven through the hedges.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bread \& Lantern:} Presenting guest-loaf and a lit lantern at a threshold shifts your next social action one step safer while you remain a guest of that hearth.
\item \textbf{Neighborly Courtesies:} When you keep local taboos (count ``eight-and-one,'' turn village stones inward, leave butter at cup-marks), cancel the first SB generated by rites or negotiations in that scene.
\item \textbf{Listen at the Stile:} A quiet pause at a stile, barrow, or hedge-tunnel yields a true omen---ask one short question about what the Hollow wants \emph{here and now}; the answer arrives as a sign, sound, or small animal.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Hearth Magic}]
The Aelaerem weave their power through careful observance and small courtesies. Their magic lies not in grand gestures but in the precise attention to thresholds, seasons, and the proper ordering of things. Red thread binds more than wounds---it ties names to places, promises to people, and the living to the Hollow that walks beneath their feet. To offend a hedge-witch is to invite the Neighbors' attention; to earn an elder's blessing is to walk with the earth's favor.

\section*{Thematic SB Spend Table}
\label{sec:thematic-sb}

\subsection*{Minor Complications (1 SB)}

\item \textbf{Foe Appears:} A [minor threat/rival/enemy] arrives on scene
\item \textbf{Gear Trouble:} A piece of equipment becomes [Compromised/Neglected]

\item \textbf{Patron Omen:} Divine/arcane forces take notice - [omen appears/blessing lost/curse manifests]
\item \textbf{Narrative Pivot:} The story takes an unexpected turn that reframes objectives
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Region-Specific SB Options}
Each region generator should include 2-3 custom SB spends that reflect its unique themes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Aelaerem (Hearth \& Hollow):} Quiet bells toll for no reason, red thread appears tied to your belongings, watch-geese honk warnings in the night
\item \textbf{Aelaerem (Threshold Magic):} A door you passed through earlier now leads somewhere else, your shadow walks behind you instead of beside you
\item \textbf{Aelaerem (Folk Customs):} You forget a crucial local taboo and offend the Neighbors; small things begin to go wrong
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Aelaerem — Strangers Hired for a Job}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A cider‑press barn perfumed with crushed apples and rain, where masks hang from beams awaiting the next festival.
\begin{quote}
"Among the Aelaerem, the orchards speak in riddles, and the harvest always demands its tithe in secrets.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A cider-press barn, the Apple-Matron watches as the party is ushered in by a mummer-captain. ``The Moot Oak bleeds wine,'' she says. ``Will you speak for the field, or let the Neighbors claim it?''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Harvest rites, masks and mummers, orchard wards, hospitality law.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Eat before asking,'' ``Dance the wrong step,'' ``Take the mask off the child.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Neighbors Cross the Hedge''; Fracture: ``The Oak Drinks''; Community: ``Shunning Begins.''
\paragraph{Complications} Masks swap faces; a ward demands a secret; cider turns to blood when questioned.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A PC’s host-family; the Matron’s heirloom press.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The Oak speaks with a PC’s voice.
\paragraph{Relief} Restore hospitality with a gift and truth; bury the mask at crossroads; share a feast to reduce Community by one.

% ====== EXTENSIONS ======

\subsection*{Faction Entanglements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Wold-Wardens:} Honor hedge-law (count stiles, turn stones inward) or suffer +1 SB on each night march; bringing steel disputes to the Moot Oak reduces the next travel DV by 1.
  \item \textbf{Mummers' Companies:} Travel under mask grants advantage crossing parochial borders; anger them (perform out of season) and village gates close at dusk (Position --).
  \item \textbf{Lantern-Wardens:} Donate oil or mend lamps to earn an escort marker; ignore a lit-lane and pay a “darkness toll” (first Stealth/Scout roll each night suffers --1 die).
  \item \textbf{Apple-Matron Circles:} Feast-days open barns and purses; snub an invitation and local prices double until amends are made.
  \item \textbf{Neighbors (quiet powers):} Leave butter at cup-marks to cancel the first supernatural SB this leg; break taboo and the Hollow stirs (add a \emph{Hollow Attention} tick).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cross-Regional Ties}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Aeler Soft-Power:} Red-thread guest-right and ledger courtesies are fashionable among Aeler houses; reputation for keeping hearth-law grants +1 die to parley with Aeler stewards and toll-clerks.
  \item \textbf{Kahfagian Sea-Lanes:} Beeswax, cider-brandy, and wool ride river-to-coast. Storm seasons push Kahfagian factors inland—good silver, stricter contracts. Privateer scares add an extra checkpoint on river crossings.
  \item \textbf{Way of Silk Spurs:} Caravans detour across the downs for night-safe lanes under lantern law; counterfeit guest-loaf tokens discovered here echo as distrust along Silk waystations (Social DV +1 until cleared).
  \item \textbf{Vhasia \& Viterra Complications:} Vhasian mills prize Aelaerem wax; Viterra tithes wool harshly. Fungal blights or tariff edicts upstream can spike prices and tempers on the greens (+1 SB on market scenes that week).
  \item \textbf{Valewood Fallout (North):} Moon-sap and dream pollen drift on certain winds: chalk mazes misalign, barrow-whispers grow bold. When \emph{Valewood Weather} is in effect, the first night omen is always true (good or ill).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Trade Goods \& Consequences}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cider, Perry, Brandy:} Moving pressed drink without feast-blessing risks spoilage—on a Miss, convert 1 load to “soured stock” (still tradable for favors, not coin).
  \item \textbf{Beeswax \& Honey:} Wax buys shrine-light in three realms; honey bribes nearly any rural official. Stealing hive-share offends winter churches (mark a \emph{Quiet Anathema} tick).
  \item \textbf{Wool \& Felts:} Warmth currency for caravans; Viterra gaugers may “adjust” measures unless shown a Moot Oak tally (treat as papers).
  \item \textbf{Red Thread \& Lantern Oil:} Thread binds minor promises; oil fuels lantern-law. Shortages raise night-travel DV by +1 across adjacent tiles.
  \item \textbf{Orchard Grafts:} Mother’s Orchard clippings count as \emph{living writs}: present one to reduce a rural audience’s Social DV by 1 once.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Patron Networks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Pale Shepherd:} Midwives and wardens trade signs at stiles; a shepherd’s whistle doubles as a quiet pass among funerary processions.
  \item \textbf{The Traveler:} Waystones scratched with eight-and-one marks reveal dusk-bypasses; leave a token and reroll one failed travel test per leg (once each route).
  \item \textbf{The Sealed Gate:} Lantern-law is abjuration in miniature; blessed door-nails act as single-use \emph{stay} against trespass (negate one forced entry this scene).
  \item \textbf{Lunara:} Winter churches keep silvered mirrors; under a waxing moon, ask one veiled question about the Hollow’s mood (Keeper answers with a sign).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Diplomatic Favor \& Reputation Echoes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Guest-Right Favor (minor resource):} Earned by hosting or upholding hearth-law in a pinch. Spend to reduce one Social DV on rural roads or to cancel the first feud-token gained in Aelaerem or Aelinnel.
  \item \textbf{Reputation Echoes:} 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \emph{Hearth-Keeper:} Villages along Aeler underpasses offer bread-and-bench unasked; toll-clerks wave you through once per arc.
      \item \emph{Mask-Breaker:} If you shamed a mummers’ company, festival lanes close early; night checks suffer --1 die until you make formal apology.
      \item \emph{Feud-Binder:} Settling an orchard feud grants +1 die to negotiations with Kahfagian river factors (word travels by cask and crew).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Boss Archetypes in Aelaerem}
\label{sec:aelaerem-bosses}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Scarecrow Regent (Omen/Threshold):} A hedge-raised guardian wearing twelve charms and one wrong knot. Commands fields, crows, and panicked livestock; grows stronger when taboos are broken.
  \item \textbf{The Hollow Bride (Otherworld/Hospitality):} A Neighbor wearing a borrowed name and wedding veil. Feeds on invitations; cannot act across a threshold unless welcomed or guest-law is breached.
  \item \textbf{Lantern Bailiff of the Moot (Justice/Order):} Enforcer of hedge-law with warrant-nails and bell-keys. Turns lamps against intruders, calls a midnight moot that can bind PCs to geased tasks.
  \item \textbf{Beekeeper of Winter Church (Sacred/Whisper):} Keeper of cold honey and sleeping hymns. Sends swarm-as-omens, seals mouths with waxed vows, and trades memories for safety.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Boss Mechanics Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Threshold Play:} Boss lair includes doors, stiles, and lintels; offering guest-loaf or turning village stones inward can shift Position (+\emph{Dominant}) for one exchange. Violating a taboo immediately grants the Boss 1 SB.
  \item \emph{Lantern Law Lair Actions:} Once per round, the Boss may snuff or flare a lane—forcing PCs to \textit{Reposition} or suffer \textit{Disorient} (---1 die) until a lamp is rekindled (simple action, oil cost).
  \item \emph{Mask Cycle (Festival Clock [4]):} Each tick changes who counts as “host” vs “guest” in the scene. While a Boss is host, social challenges vs. them are +1 DV and their reactions create +1 SB on a miss.
  \item \emph{Hollow Openings:} On face cards, burrows connect rooms; failed retreats loop to the same entry unless a PC spends a \emph{Lantern-writ} or places red thread at the junction.
\end{itemize}
