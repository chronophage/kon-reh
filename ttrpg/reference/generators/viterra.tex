\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:viterra-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until all four suits appear: Spade=place, Heart=actor, Club=pressure, Diamond=leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (licenses, writs, charters): they change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo law \& ledger motifs---writs that weigh, ledgers that remember, and justice that keeps its sums.
\end{itemize}
