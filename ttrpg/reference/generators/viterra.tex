\section{Viterra --- ``The Hedge-Law Realm''}
\label{chap:viterra}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Viterra breathes with the careful rhythm of precedent and petition. Once a proud kingdom before foreign conquest, now reborn under a Warrior Queen who rules by legal precision as much as military might. The realm's true sinews lie not in steel but in writs, charters, and the ancient rights that bind lord to tenant, crown to county, and church to common. Every hedge-row, every parish stone, every ferry crossing carries the weight of custom older than memory. Here, a well-placed bribe can open doors that armies cannot breach, and a single forged document may topple houses greater than dukes. The Queen maintains her throne through the careful application of law, the manipulation of ancient rights, and the delicate balance between imperial legacy and reclaimed sovereignty.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:viterra-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (writs/charters/priority) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{hedge-law} motif—boundaries blur, charters contradict, precedent splinters, and the careful web of legal authority shows its cracks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hedge-Law Momentum:} When valid \emph{writ, charter, or warrant} presented in proper parish, step \textbf{Position} up one category on social/logistical actions in locale for scene. First contradiction starts \textbf{Border-Lace (4)} clock; advance each time competing papers invoked.
\item \textbf{Beacon \& Bell Chain:} If two adjacent \emph{beacons} or \emph{brotherhood bells} under your influence, convert one \textbf{Club} draw into travel delay for \emph{others} while party proceeds with improved \textbf{Effect} for movement/logistics. Signal draws scrutiny; GM may bank 1 SB tied to local authority.
\item \textbf{River-Right Window:} At ferry, tidework, or customs stair, play any \textbf{Diamond} tied to crossings/seals to open short \emph{window of lawful passage}: one convoy passes uninspected, or one cargo clears at priority. Window closes immediately if storm, audit, or levy card revealed.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Viterra, power flows through the careful application of law, the management of ancient rights, and the delicate balance between imperial legacy and reclaimed sovereignty. The Warrior Queen maintains authority through a combination of military might and legal precision, while the old duchies and local officials wield influence through their knowledge of traditional customs and hedge-law. The true power lies with those who can navigate this complex legal landscape and maintain the appearance of legitimate authority while building genuine support.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Viterra revolves around legal documents, local rights, and the ability to command respect from institutions that are still finding their post-imperial identity. Rewards often take the form of writs, charters, and official positions that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (seals, writs, charters) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival duchies issue conflicting authorities, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the courts, parishes, and muster grounds as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of law and custom determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Viterra, your papers are your power, and your power determines whether you rule or are ruled.

\section*{Thematic SB Spend Table}
\label{sec:viterra-sb}

\subsection*{Minor Complications (1 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Exposure:} Your actions draw unwanted attention from \textbf{reeves or customs officials}, men who know the law and how to use it against you.
\item \textbf{Noise:} Sounds of your actions alert nearby \textbf{levy serjeants or court clerks}, officials with sharp ears and sharper quills.
\item \textbf{Trace:} Evidence of your passage marks your route for \textbf{trackers or tax collectors}, men who follow paper trails as easily as footprints.
\item \textbf{Delay:} A brief but meaningful setback costs you \textbf{time or favorable legal window}, missing the chance to present your case before the right magistrate.
\item \textbf{Supply Strain:} Mark +1 segment on a relevant \textbf{resource clock}, perhaps coin running short when bribes are needed most.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Moderate Setbacks (2 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Alarm Raised:} \textbf{Sheriff or parish surveyor} becomes aware and begins responding, summoning men with writs and warrants.
\item \textbf{Position Lost:} You lose advantageous ground/cover/stealth due to \textbf{legal challenge or road closure}, forced to deal with officials demanding proper papers.
\item \textbf{Foe Appears:} A \textbf{rival faction or routier company} arrives on scene, perhaps tipped off by someone who saw your papers.
\item \textbf{Gear Trouble:} A piece of equipment becomes \textbf{Compromised/Neglected}, perhaps a seal ring worn smooth or a charter damaged by rain.
\item \textbf{Lock/Barrier:} A simple obstacle now requires a test to overcome, perhaps a gate that demands proper toll or a bridge that requires inspection fees.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Serious Trouble (3 SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reinforcements:} Additional \textbf{Dawn-knights, levy forces, or rival ducal troops} arrive, summoned by officials who take legal disputes seriously.
\item \textbf{Key Gear Breaks:} A crucial tool/weapon becomes temporarily unusable, perhaps a seal ring that breaks or a charter that tears at the wrong moment.
\item \textbf{Major Twist:} The situation fundamentally changes - \textbf{writ voided/levy called/border dispute erupts}, legal foundations shift beneath your feet.
\item \textbf{Rail Tick:} Advance a relevant campaign/front clock by 1 segment, perhaps a conspiracy clock or a rebellion brewing in the countryside.
\item \textbf{Condition Applied:} Mark \textbf{Fatigue 1/Harm 1/Condition} appropriate to fiction, perhaps the stress of legal maneuvering wearing on your nerves.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Major Turns (4+ SB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Trap Springs:} A prepared danger activates with full effect, perhaps a legal trap set by rivals who know your weaknesses.
\item \textbf{Authority Arrival:} \textbf{Warrior Queen, Justiciar, or Crown Council} intervenes, bringing the full weight of legal authority to bear.
\item \textbf{Scene Shift:} The environment changes dramatically - \textbf{flood hits/levy called/court erupts}, legal proceedings disrupted by natural or political forces.
\item \textbf{Patron Omen:} Divine/arcane forces take notice - \textbf{omen appears/blessing lost/curse manifests}, perhaps signs that the law itself takes sides.
\item \textbf{Narrative Pivot:} The story takes an unexpected turn that reframes objectives, perhaps revealing that your legal authority was forged or that your enemies hold the real writs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Region-Specific SB Options}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Viterra (Hedge-Law):} Boundaries shift without warning, legal papers contradict each other, precedents reverse mid-argument, and the careful web of authority shows its cracks.
\item \textbf{Viterra (Legal Warfare):} Court decisions change with tide, writs expire at crucial moments, clerks demand additional fees, and justice depends more on purse than principle.
\item \textbf{Viterra (Border Disputes):} Parish stones move overnight, toll roads sprout new collectors, ferry operators go on strike, and every crossing demands negotiation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Viterra — Hedge‑Law Realm}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A flooded law quarter where reeds clutch at marble steps and justiciars wear waterproof vellum, their quill-pens never far from hand.
\begin{quote}
"In Viterra, law bends with the tide, and justice drowns those who hold their breath too long. But those who know the right words, the right seals, and the right hands to grease can walk dry-shod through any flood."
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Law Quarter, a Justiciar offers a coronation writ. ``The Queen rides the tide,'' she says. ``And the fen-reeves sharpen their tally-rods. But remember - in this realm, a well-placed bribe can open doors that armies cannot breach.''

\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Hedge courts, water-rights, tally-rods, coronation processions, sealed writs, quill-pens and wax seals.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Forge a writ,'' ``Change a boundary,'' ``Name a false heir,'' ``Bribe the right clerk,'' ``Hide evidence in plain sight.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Community: ``Fen Unrest''; Threat: ``Usurper's Move''; Anchor: ``Hedge Peace.''
\paragraph{Complications} Rods count breath; marsh lights lead elsewhere; writs blur; clerks demand additional fees; justices of the peace take bribes.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A reed-chapel; a ferryman ally; a clerk who knows your secrets.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The tide arrives at the wrong hour, and with it, auditors with suspicious eyes.
\paragraph{Relief} Seat the rightful claimant; redraw a map in public; accept a marsh-due; forge the right seal; pay the right bribe.

\section*{Conspiracy Elements}

\subsection*{Court Intrigue}
The Queen's court is a web of alliances and betrayals, where a single whispered word can elevate a man to power or send him to the block. Spies are everywhere, and loyalty is bought and sold like any other commodity. Courtiers plot advancement through legal maneuver, knowing that the right charter or the right pardon can be worth more than a chest of gold.

\subsection*{Legal Manipulation}
In Viterra, the law is not a fixed thing but a living, breathing entity that can be shaped by those who know its secrets. Precedent can be found or created, writs can be forged or interpreted to suit one's needs, and the careful application of ancient rights can grant power over lords and commoners alike. The truly skilled can make the law dance to their tune.

\subsection*{Economic Warfare}
Trade is the lifeblood of the realm, and those who control the flow of goods control the fate of nations. Customs officials can be bribed, tolls can be negotiated, and the right charter can open trade routes that others thought closed. But economic warfare cuts both ways - a single forged manifest can ruin a merchant's reputation, and the wrong word in the right ear can see a ship seized and its cargo confiscated.

\subsection*{Information Networks}
In the age of quill and parchment, information is power. Writ-runners carry news faster than horses, and the right message delivered to the right person at the right time can change the course of history. Spies operate under cover of legal business, and the careful cultivation of sources can provide advantages that no amount of steel can match.

\subsection*{Religious Politics}
The clash between Light and Everflame is not merely theological but deeply political. Each faction controls vast resources and has its own interpretation of law and custom. A parish priest's word can make or break a man's fortunes, and the support of the right religious authority can provide legitimacy that no crown can grant. But religious politics are treacherous waters - one misstep can see a man branded heretic and his property confiscated.

\subsection*{Regional Autonomy}
The old duchies still remember their independence, and local officials wield influence through their knowledge of traditional customs and hedge-law. What passes for law in Valora may not hold sway in the Fenlands, and a writ that carries weight in the Highlands may be worthless on the coast. Those who would wield power in Viterra must understand these regional differences and navigate them with care.

\subsection*{The Power of the Written Word}
In Viterra, the written word carries the weight of law itself. A charter properly sealed can grant authority over men and lands, while a forged document can destroy houses greater than dukes. The careful preservation of records ensures that debts are remembered and obligations honored, while the destruction of the same can erase a man's very existence. Those who master the art of the written word master the realm itself.
