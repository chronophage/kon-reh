\section{Viterra --- ``The Hedge-Law Realm''}
\label{chap:viterra}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Viterra is a kingdom bound less by steel than by precedent, its borders traced in hedgerows, dikes, and river-rights. Once a proud kingdom before being conquered by the Utar empire, Viterra has reclaimed its identity after 300 years of foreign rule. The newly crowned \index{Queen of Viterra} Queen rules from Valora, not by inherited peace but by hard campaigns won and rivals broken. Yet the old duchies still remember their moots, their reeves, their rights; and every parish stone and ferry post holds the seed of dispute. Here, \index{law} law is both shield and spear, and the weight of a charter may outweigh the blade of a sword.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:viterra-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (writs/charters/priority) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{hedge-law} motif—boundaries blur, charters contradict, precedent splinters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hedge-Law Momentum:} When valid \emph{writ, charter, or warrant} presented in proper parish, step \textbf{Position} up one category on social/logistical actions in locale for scene. First contradiction starts \textbf{Border-Lace (4)} clock; advance each time competing papers invoked.
\item \textbf{Beacon \& Bell Chain:} If two adjacent \emph{beacons} or \emph{brotherhood bells} under your influence, convert one \textbf{Club} draw into travel delay for \emph{others} while party proceeds with improved \textbf{Effect} for movement/logistics. Signal draws scrutiny; GM may bank 1 SB tied to local authority.
\item \textbf{River-Right Window:} At ferry, tidework, or customs stair, play any \textbf{Diamond} tied to crossings/seals to open short \emph{window of lawful passage}: one convoy passes uninspected, or one cargo clears at priority. Window closes immediately if storm, audit, or levy card revealed.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Viterra, power flows through the careful application of law, the management of ancient rights, and the delicate balance between imperial legacy and reclaimed sovereignty. The Warrior Queen maintains authority through a combination of military might and legal precision, while the old duchies and local officials wield influence through their knowledge of traditional customs and hedge-law. The true power lies with those who can navigate this complex legal landscape and maintain the appearance of legitimate authority while building genuine support.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Viterra revolves around legal documents, local rights, and the ability to command respect from institutions that are still finding their post-imperial identity. Rewards often take the form of writs, charters, and official positions that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (seals, writs, charters) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival duchies issue conflicting authorities, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the courts, parishes, and muster grounds as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of law and custom determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Viterra, your papers are your power, and your power determines whether you rule or are ruled.
