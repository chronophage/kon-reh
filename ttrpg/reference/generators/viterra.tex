\section{Viterra --- ``The Hedge-Law Realm''}
\label{chap:viterra}

\subsection*{Elite (Warrior Queen)}
\textit{``Every hedge here marks not just a boundary but a principle – the careful balance between order and freedom, justice and mercy. Our law grows like the hedges themselves, tended with precision and patience.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Fen reeve with tally-rod speaking for dike guilds)}
\textit{``The dikes hold back more than water – they hold back chaos. Every rod measured, every stone placed, keeps the flood from washing away not just our fields but our very way of life.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Viterra breathes with the careful rhythm of precedent and petition. Once a proud kingdom before foreign conquest, now reborn under a Warrior Queen who rules by legal precision as much as military might. The realm's true sinews lie not in steel but in writs, charters, and the ancient rights that bind lord to tenant, crown to county, and church to common. Every hedge-row, every parish stone, every ferry crossing carries the weight of custom older than memory. Here, a well-placed document can open doors that armies cannot breach, and a single forged seal may topple houses greater than dukes. The Queen maintains her throne through the careful application of law, the manipulation of ancient rights, and the delicate balance between imperial legacy and reclaimed sovereignty.

But law in Viterra is not merely governance—it is warfare. Legal documents are weapons, courtrooms are battlefields, and the pen cuts as deep as any blade.

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (categories)}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:viterra-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (writs/charters/priority) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{hedge-law} motif—boundaries blur, charters contradict, precedent splinters, and the careful web of legal authority shows its cracks. Legal warfare escalates to physical conflict.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hedge-Law Momentum:} When valid \emph{writ, charter, or warrant} presented in proper parish, step \textbf{Position} up one category on social/logistical actions in locale for scene. First contradiction starts \textbf{Border-Lace (4)} clock; advance each time competing papers invoked.
\item \textbf{Beacon \& Bell Chain:} If two adjacent \emph{beacons} or \emph{brotherhood bells} under your influence, convert one \textbf{Club} draw into travel delay for \emph{others} while party proceeds with improved \textbf{Effect} for movement/logistics. Signal draws scrutiny; GM may bank 1 SB tied to local authority.
\item \textbf{River-Right Window:} At ferry, tidework, or customs stair, play any \textbf{Diamond} tied to crossings/seals to open short \emph{window of lawful passage}: one convoy passes uninspected, or one cargo clears at priority. Window closes immediately if storm, audit, or levy card revealed.
\item \textbf{Legal Duel Protocol:} When legal disputes cannot be resolved through argument, parties may challenge to duel. Winner's position becomes legally binding. Requires proper sanction and seconds.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Viterra, power flows through the careful application of law, the management of ancient rights, and the delicate balance between imperial legacy and reclaimed sovereignty. The Warrior Queen maintains authority through a combination of military might and legal precision, while the old duchies and local officials wield influence through their knowledge of traditional customs and hedge-law. The true power lies with those who can navigate this complex legal landscape and maintain the appearance of legitimate authority while building genuine support.

But remember—in Viterra, law is warfare. Every document is a weapon, every courtroom a battlefield, and every advocate a soldier. The pen cuts as deep as any blade, and legal victory can be as decisive as military conquest.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Viterra revolves around legal documents, local rights, and the ability to command respect from institutions that are still finding their post-imperial identity. Rewards often take the form of writs, charters, and official positions that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (seals, writs, charters) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival duchies issue conflicting authorities, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the courts, parishes, and muster grounds as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of law and custom determines success.
\item When legal conflicts escalate beyond words, transition naturally to physical confrontation with appropriate stakes.
\end{itemize}
In Viterra, your papers are your power, and your power determines whether you rule or are ruled. But when words fail, steel speaks—and the law says both are valid.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Legal Combat System}

\subsection*{Dueling Advocates}
When legal disputes cannot be resolved through negotiation, parties may engage in formal legal duels. These combine verbal sparring with physical combat:

\textbf{Phase 1: Pleadings}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each advocate presents their case (Wits + Sway vs. DV 3)
\item Success grants +1 die to next phase
\item Failure creates 1 SB that opponent can spend
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Phase 2: Cross-Examination}
\begin{itemize}
\item Attack opponent's arguments (Wits + Insight vs. DV 3)
\item Success inflicts Fatigue 1 on opponent
\item Critical success (6+ dice showing 6) forces opponent to answer truthfully
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Phase 3: Trial by Combat (if unresolved)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Physical combat with legal stakes
\item Winner's position becomes legally binding

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Light Preacher:} Civil law takes precedence, but religious oaths carry weight
\item \textbf{Everflame Canon Lawyer:} Religious law supersedes civil in spiritual matters
\item \textbf{Mixed Tribunals:} Joint religious-civil courts for moral crimes
\item \textbf{Excommunication:} Legal disability in addition to spiritual consequences
\end{itemize}

\item Flood liability determined by ancient customs
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Highland Law}

\subsection*{Viterra — Hedge-Law on the March}
\textbf{Starting Location:} The Hall of Dawning tilt-yard at first light, where advocates rehearse arguments as Dawn-knights rehearse cuts.
\begin{quote}
“In Viterra, a seal is a sword you carry in your pocket.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} The Law Quarter, a Queen’s Justiciar slides a parchment across an oaken rail. “Three charters, one road,” they say. “Carry the Queen’s writ to Belworth, break the Quiet Tolls, and make the sheriffs agree—by clause or by cut.”

\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Hedge-bounds, beacon chains, writ-runners, duel warrants, parish maps that don’t agree.

\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} “Forge the second seal,” “Call a dawn duel,” “Re-survey the hedge and move the world.”

\paragraph{External Clocks} 
Threat: \emph{Border-Lace Snarls}; Community: \emph{Tax Riot at Fairport}; Anchor: \emph{Dawn-Order Prestige}; (optional) Fracture: \emph{Three Laws, One Road}.

\paragraph{Complications} Beacons mis-signal; two sheriffs post rival notices; a guild clerk “finds” an older clause.

\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A parish reeve who signed for you; a ferryman family at Belworth; a Dawn-knight second with your reputation in their mouth.

\paragraph{Escalation Beat} A bell peals the wrong hour and every warrant dated this morning becomes “yesterday.”

\paragraph{Relief} Produce a superior map (Map Correction) to reset \emph{Border-Lace} by 1; host a hedge-moot to swap oaths (spend 2 \Boons{} to downgrade a riot); submit to a sanctioned legal duel to collapse a three-way claim into one enforceable ruling.

\medskip

\section*{Region-Specific SB Options (Viterra)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hedge-Law Tangles:} Boundary stones “walk,” parish lines disagree aloud, clerks insist your seal’s wax is the wrong shade.
\item \textbf{Beacon Precedent:} A signal tower cites case-law; lights encode rulings; your opponent argues by mirror until dawn.
\item \textbf{Queenspeace Clause:} Any brawl on a milestone becomes court; weapons sheathed or pay treble fines in public.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Cross-Regional Entanglements}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Into Ubral:} \emph{Ducal Warrant} acts as \emph{Guest-Token} once at a clan hearth, but starts a \emph{Feud Rekindled} tick if you collect tolls twice in a tenday.
\item \textbf{Into Theona:} \emph{Ferry Priority} overrides a local taboo once; if the Ninth custom is in play, the writ “forgets” one clause on use (GM banks 1 SB).
\item \textbf{Into Vhasia:} \emph{Duel Sanction} is recognized on the Pont-du-Tithe—but a rival abbey can convert it into \emph{Parlement Divided} on a Club draw.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Quick Hook:} If any \textbf{A} appears in Viterra, echo \textbf{hedge-law}: boundary stones contradict maps, beacons cite precedent, and a single clause rearranges a road’s authority for a scene.

% ====== VITERRA: CONSPIRACY FLOURISHES (LIGHTWEIGHT) ======
\subsection*{Conspiracy Flourishes (keep it close, keep it quiet)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Hedge-Moots at Dusk:} Parish elders “trim hedges” while trading sealed whispers.
  \item \textbf{Cipher Roses:} Folded writs stamped with thorn-petals; one petal missing marks a false clause.
  \item \textbf{Mirror Hours:} Beacons flash lawful signals—reversed for those who know the counter-code.
  \item \textbf{Eel-Letters:} Oiled parchment smuggled in eel-baskets; ink runs in water, truth does not.
  \item \textbf{Quiet Steel, Quieter Quills:} Dawn-knights duel at first light; advocates settle three duels before breakfast with ink alone.
  \item \textbf{Progress Masks:} Courtiers wear legal devices as masque motifs (seal, chain, beacon) to signal faction at a glance.
  \item \textbf{Bell Penance:} A single off-hour peal grants amnesty to those who confess a clause before the twelfth echo.
\end{itemize}

% ====== VITERRA: BOSS GALLERY (3) ======
\subsection*{Boss Hooks (three faces of the hedge)}
\paragraph*{The Violet Clerk (Master of Counter-Seals)}
\emph{Face:} Mild, ink-stained, never without a candle-box.  
\emph{Wants:} To prove the Queen’s title by destroying every rival document—without touching a sword.  
\emph{Moves:} Produces “earlier” patents; splits a single writ into two contradictory copies; declares a \emph{Seal Fast} (paper cannot change hands for a scene).  
\emph{Mechanic—Seal Pressure [4]:} Each time you flash leverage (Diamond), tick \emph{Seal Pressure}. At 4, one held Diamond is ruled \emph{void unless defended} (treat a social as Desperate but +1 Effect if you cite precedent).

\paragraph*{The Thorn Captain (Queen’s Quiet Hand)}
\emph{Face:} Dawn-cloak, bare helm, oath on the tongue.  
\emph{Wants:} To keep the Queen alive by pruning conspiracies at the root.  
\emph{Moves:} Names a \emph{Queenspeace Zone} (weapons sheathed or fines triple), calls a sanctioned \emph{Duel Warrant}, swaps the field—court becomes tilt-yard.  
\emph{Mechanic—Peace or Point:} When the Captain appears, party must choose: \emph{Peace} (improve Position, but GM banks 1 SB) or \emph{Point} (enter a 3-exchange duel; winning sets a binding ruling for this scene).

\paragraph*{The Saffron Abbess (Keeper of Bell-Law)}
\emph{Face:} Ember eyes, quiet hands, ledger of souls and ships.  
\emph{Wants:} To bind river, parish, and beacon to one holy timetable.  
\emph{Moves:} Rings a \emph{Wrong Hour} (dates slide a day), blesses or damns a seal, invokes mixed tribunal on the spot.  
\emph{Mechanic—Bell-Ledger [3]:} Each scene under her gaze, mark 1 if you profit by clause or tide. At 3, she claims \emph{tithe in truth}: reveal one hidden fact or lose 1 Effect until confessed.

% ====== VITERRA: MICRO-MECHANICS (SIMPLE) ======
\subsection*{Micro-Mechanics (plug-and-play)}
\paragraph*{Mask \& Measure Dial (Public Loyalty \(\leftrightarrow\) Private Fealty)}
Track the party’s posture during intrigue.  
\emph{Public High:} +1 Position when acting under open writ or beacon. First covert act each session starts one step worse.  
\emph{Private High:} +1 Effect on clandestine bargains/forgeries. First public petition or duel starts one step worse.  
\emph{Center:} Host a hedge-moot, surrender a forged clause, or escort a rival safely through a parish.

\paragraph*{Clause Gambits (1/scene if fiction fits)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Ink Substitution:} Downgrade a hostile \textbf{Club} to \emph{Audit Freeze} but start \emph{Border-Lace} +1.
  \item \emph{Beacon Appeal:} Treat one social as if backed by a \emph{Bellmark} (once); next beacon scene begins one step worse.
  \item \emph{Hedge Survey:} Swap Place for Pressure: convert a muddled location into a crisp legal obstacle (Lock/Barrier appears, but +1 die to crack it).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Conspiracy Tick (table safety switch)}
Any time the party lies with a seal, bribes a clerk, or dodges levy by clause, tick \emph{Conspiracy [4]}.  
At 2: an ally gains leverage over you (minor blackmail).  
At 4: a faction forces a choice—burn a contact or face \emph{Legal Duel Challenge}.

% ====== VITERRA: START-OF-SCENE RUMORS ======
\subsection*{Start-of-Scene Rumors (1d6, low-noise)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Wrong Wax:} your rival’s seals softened; +1d to forgeries this scene.
  \item \emph{Empty Beacon:} tower unmanned; travel faster, scrutiny harsher.
  \item \emph{Dawn-Lane Cleared:} first convoy action gains +1 Position.
  \item \emph{Clerk’s Wedding:} filings delayed; first petition ignores \emph{Audit Freeze}.
  \item \emph{Fen High Water:} ferries slow; river-charters count double value.
  \item \emph{Mask at Progress:} someone at court uses your name; +1d to social opens, +1 SB banked by GM.
\end{enumerate}

% ====== VITERRA: THREE QUICK SEEDS ======
\subsection*{Quick Seeds}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Three Charters, One Road:} Deliver the Queen’s writ before the Abbess rings the Wrong Hour.
  \item \textbf{Seal of Eels:} An eel-basket ledger names a traitor—prove it without drawing steel.
  \item \textbf{Mirror on Beacon Hill:} A rival signals treason in code; decode or duel by dawn.
\end{itemize}
