\section{Viterra --- ``The Hedge-Law Realm'' Generator}
\label{chap:viterra}

Viterra is a kingdom bound less by steel than by precedent, its borders traced in hedgerows, dikes, and river-rights. The newly crowned \index{Queen of Viterra} Queen rules from Valora, not by inherited peace but by hard campaigns won and rivals broken. Yet the old duchies still remember their moots, their reeves, their rights; and every parish stone and ferry post holds the seed of dispute. Here, \index{law} law is both shield and spear, and the weight of a charter may outweigh the blade of a sword.  

\subsection*{Spades --- Places (fens, dales, beacons, courts, Dolmis shore)}
\label{sec:viterra-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Fen causeway stile with a toll-rod and eel carts queueing; each reeve claims the right to collect.
\item Hedgerow muster-green in the Dales; bows strung under apple trees, charters signed in cider cups.
\item Beacon hill above the Highlands; its fire-grate still warm from last winter’s levy call.
\item Belworth ferry-stairs with ledgers gone damp and three keeps arguing the tolls.
\item Old iron-bloom quarry turned drill yard; hammer echoes carry, but the forge-reeve still holds tally.
\item Parish-stone maze where three maps disagree; the hedge-priest’s vote decides who pays.
\item Fairport tideworks at the Dolmis mouth; customs writs in three languages flutter like pennons.
\item Valora’s Law Quarter—archives, oath-rooms, the Hall of Dawning where precedent is birthed in ink.
\item Tarlington counting fields beside the muster ground; wagons load, but the ledgers mis-sum.
\item[J] River dike crown: ring of turf and timber, brotherhood bells warn of flood—and spies.
\item[Q] The Queen’s Progress encampment—canvas palisade, banners stiff, and whispering old courtiers.
\item[K] Hall of Dawning tilt-yard at first light; Dawn-knights drill clean, their loyalties written in contracts.
\item[A] Queen’s Highway milestone above Dolmis road; three sheriffs post their seals over hers.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (reeves, guilds, knights, crown)}
\label{sec:viterra-people}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Fen reeve with a tally-rod; speaks for dike guilds and remembers every flood-year’s debts.
\item River-carter syndic who moves grain faster than rumor and knows which writs matter.
\item Parish surveyor with three maps and one opinion; his hedge-walks settle more disputes than courts.
\item Quartermaster of the Dawn—ledgers sharper than her tongue, logistics before lances.
\item Dales levy serjeant—bow calm, cider breath, memory keen for every loophole.
\item Two-altars cleric-pair: Light circuit-preacher vs. Everflame canon lawyer; their debates decide tithe law.
\item Fairport shipwright with Dolmis cousins; his skiff carries more secrets than cargo.
\item Fenwood comptroller conjures wagons with a signature, silence with a seal.
\item Queen’s Justiciar—law on the road, polite as a noose, bearing three kings’ judgments.
\item[J] Border routier-captain who reads ledgers as well as ambushes and serves two crowns.
\item[Q] The Warrior Queen of Viterra—crown on helm, sword at her side, patient sums behind her gaze.
\item[K] The Crown in Council—Fenwood dukes, guild envoys, and abbots, each weighing grain against glory.
\item[A] Tarling-blood rumor: a lost sigil surfaces; old loyalties twitch like hounds on a scent.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (water, law, border-lace, weather)}
\label{sec:viterra-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Dike breach in black-rain; the wrong reeve claims credit while wagons drown.
\item Feast-day clash: Light vs. Everflame processions collide; shutters slam, writs fly.
\item Quiet tolls sprout on the Queen’s Highway; escorts sniff traps, sheriffs argue rights.
\item Counting-house audit freezes your cargo; Queen’s seal vs. old writs.
\item Border-lace snarl—three courts arrest the same hay-cart; whose hay is it?
\item Isle moot refusal: Theona withholds levy, quays choke on rumor.
\item Delta spat: Fairport vs. Marcott customs; barges stack three deep, merchants pick sides.
\item Routier arrears: a free-company flips unless someone pays; your name’s on their ledger.
\item Salt pinch—import spikes, bakers barricade, Queen’s promise tastes like thin gruel.
\item[J] Dawn recall—your escort pulled to a flood-struck parish; your writ argues with the river.
\item[Q] Aberielist intrigue: royalist seals in the wrong hands; the Queen’s patience thins.
\item[K] Levy call-up: dalesmen mustered, your wagons seized “for the realm.”
\item[A] Dolmis gale train: winds slam the coast, timetables drown, writs tear in spray.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (writs, charters, priority, labor)}
\label{sec:viterra-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Ferry priority at Belworth crossing (once); the horn answers, though perhaps the wrong ferry.
\item Dike-work allotment: brotherhood labor granted if three clerks can be convinced.
\item Market-day license in Valora’s square; guild nod still needed.
\item Dawn escort letter (four lances at dawn); loyalty waxes and wanes with pay.
\item River-carter line charter; guaranteed haul on the grain artery—weather permitting.
\item Parish-map correction; hedge moves, borders shift, lawsuits bloom.
\item Fairport customs seal for Dolmis cargo; honored today, disputed tomorrow.
\item County Thing ruling; sharp local bite, but appeals run swifter than oaths.
\item Salt allotment from a winter depot; Queen’s writ opens, old hands still count sacks.
\item[J] Wardship of a minor fen-keep; men-at-arms “for now,” but the tutor has plans.
\item[Q] Private audience with the Queen; her questions strike like thrusts.
\item[K] Fenwood ducal warrant to enforce customs; old power bows, new power watches.
\item[A] Coronation writ: amnesty and remission for those who kneel—old debts still owed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\label{sec:viterra-features}
\paragraph{Hedge-Law Momentum}
When a valid \emph{writ, charter, or warrant} is presented in its proper parish, step \textbf{Position} up one category on social/logistical actions in that locale for the scene. The first time a contradiction arises, start a \textbf{Border-Lace (4)} clock; advance it each time competing papers are invoked.

\paragraph{Beacon \& Bell Chain}
If two adjacent \emph{beacons} or \emph{brotherhood bells} are under your influence, you may convert one \textbf{Club} draw into a travel delay for \emph{others} while your party proceeds with improved \textbf{Effect} for movement/logistics. The signal draws scrutiny; the GM may bank 1 SB tied to local authority.

\paragraph{River-Right Window}
At a ferry, tidework, or customs stair, you may play any \textbf{Diamond} tied to crossings or seals to open a short \emph{window of lawful passage}: one convoy passes uninspected, or one cargo clears at priority. The window closes immediately if a storm, audit, or levy card is revealed.

\subsection*{Quick Use Notes}
\label{sec:viterra-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw 4: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = complication, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets Clock length.
\item Diamonds = legal outcomes (writs, charters, warrants) that shift position, not dice.
\item If any Ace appears, echo hedge-law: boundaries blur, charters contradict, precedent splinters.
\end{itemize}
