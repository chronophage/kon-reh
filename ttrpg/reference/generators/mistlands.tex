\section{Mistlands --- ``Bells, Salt, and Breath''}
\label{chap:mistlands}

\subsection*{Elite (Legate of Mists)}
\textit{``The bells here do more than mark time – they weave the very fabric of reality, keeping the mist at bay and the dead in their proper places. Each chime is a thread in the pattern that holds the world together.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Salt-Monk who blesses pans and keeps ward-measure honest)}
\textit{``Salt don't just preserve the fish – it holds back the things that shouldn't walk. Every grain blessed is a prayer, and every prayer keeps the mist from remembering your name.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
The Mistlands lie north of the Aelerian mountains, where the Aberderrin Sea laps against reed-fens and drowned shores. It is a Protectorate of the Aeler, but their iron passes only hold the southern roads---the land itself belongs to fog and bells. Every levee hums with ward-notes, every ferry takes salt as tithe, and every shadow is measured against the Direwood's endless breath. The people here live by the weight of salt, the echo of bells, and the hope that their names will not be spoken by the mists.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Fen/Levee/Bell-line)} Reed-fen causey with chalked ward-runes on every milestone; Bell-Line levee with iron posts and eight bells per span.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:mistlands-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (passes/seals/tokens) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{breath and boundary}---bells answering across water, salt that won't dry, voices returning late.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Breath-Toll:} Many claim mist remembers every breath. Travelers hold breath crossing bridges, fearing mist will count them wrong.
\item \textbf{Salt as Promise:} Handful of salt is more than warding---it is vow. Spill on plank or stone swears safety; break it, invite Direwood's claim.
\item \textbf{The Ninth Bell:} Legends say ninth bell once rang on Line. Note not in ringbooks; no warden speaks of it. Some nights, though, it rings---gates open where none should be.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In the Mistlands, power flows through ritual, warding, and the careful balance between the living and the dead. The Aeler Protectorate maintains nominal control through military presence and legal frameworks, but true authority lies with those who understand the bells, the salt, and the breath of the land itself. Local wardens, salt-monks, and bell-keepers hold sway over daily life, while the Legate of the Mists mediates between imperial law and ancient custom.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in the Mistlands revolves around protection---from mist, from spirits, from the encroaching forest. Rewards often take the form of tokens, seals, or safe passage that can be leveraged into greater security. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (salt, bells, lanterns) that can be challenged, depleted, or voided.
\item Let rival factions issue conflicting protections, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the levees, ferries, and watchtowers as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of the old ways determines success.
\end{itemize}
In the Mistlands, your safety is your standing, and your standing depends on who remembers your name.

\subsection*{Mistlands — Bells and Breath}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A levee path veiled in fog, where bell‑ropes sway though no wind stirs, and each ring tastes like a heartbeat.
\begin{quote}
“In the Mistlands, breath is currency and silence a sin.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Bell-Line levee, a Ferryman demands a name as toll. When the party hesitates, a Bell-Warden steps forward. ``The Ninth Bell rings tonight. Will you answer—or flee?''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} River fog, toll-names, bell law, lung-charms.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Give another’s name,'' ``Ring early,'' ``Take breath not yours.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Ninth Peal''; Community: ``Stampede on the Levee''; Anchor: ``Ferryman’s Promise.''
\paragraph{Complications} Breath frosts bells; names echo wrong; the levee shortens.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A ferryman’s child; a PC’s breath-charm.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The river exhales.
\paragraph{Relief} Pay with a memory; speak the unsaid name; spend 2 \Boons{} to buy silence.

% ====== MISTLANDS: PLUG-IN EXTENSIONS (BELLS, SALT, & BREATH) ======

\subsection*{Extensions (Plug-in)}
\label{sec:mistlands-extensions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Protectorate Dial (Aeler \(\leftrightarrow\) Local Custom):} Place a two-step dial; move it when scenes side with \emph{Aeler decree} or \emph{bell-lore}.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Aeler High:} +1 Position when invoking writs, escorts, or ration claims; first folk-charm in a scene \emph{fails politely}.
    \item \emph{Custom High:} +1 Effect for ward, bell, or salt rites; first Protectorate demand in a scene starts one step worse Position.
    \item Center the dial by an offering (salt tithe repaid, bells re-hung, shared watch on a levee).
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Cross-Region Hooks (optional draws):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{True Masons Detachment} arrives to “standardize” a levee; accept their work to downgrade \emph{Bell-Line Failure} once, but start \emph{Customs Resentment} [4].
    \item \emph{Aeler Edgewalkers} scout new reed-cuts; escort them to clear \emph{Ground-Mist} for one scene, then tick \emph{Direwood Moan}.
    \item \emph{Kahfagian Tide Advice} conflicts with local bell-notes; choose one: +1 die to navigation \emph{or} avoid \emph{Wrong Bell} this scene (not both).
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Faction Entanglements During Travel:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Carrying a \emph{Protectorate Mark} ignores the first \emph{Protectorate Interdiction}; if you also refuse a bell-warden’s counsel, start \emph{Rite-Purge} at +1.
    \item Displaying \emph{Refuge-Right} grants +1 die to cross Gate checkpoints; on a miss, begin \emph{Names Disputed} [4] (paper vs.\ bell-book).
    \item Trading \emph{Ward-Salt} off-ledger downgrades \emph{Ward-Salt Short} once, but ticks \emph{Salt Audit} [4] with the Legate’s clerks.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Patron Touchpoints (use sparingly):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adur (Flame \& Light):} Sanctify a bell as \textsc{Ward}; once/scene you may steady panic on a levee (clear 1 segment of \emph{Stampede on the Levee}). Breaking the sanctity triggers \emph{General Alarm}.
    \item \textbf{Mykkiel (Writ \& Seal):} Name a \emph{Wraith-Indemnity} clause; reduce legal fallout by one step, but mark Exposure +1 as bell-keepers object.
    \item \textbf{Lunara (Whispered Tides):} Ask one yes/no about a mist-borne spirit under moonlight; on a miss, \emph{Witchlight Count} enters play.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Salt \& Breath Economy (minor currency):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Ward Salt} tokens earned by volunteering at pans or restoring bell-lines; spend 1 to cancel the first \emph{Ground-Mist} penalty in a scene.
    \item \emph{Breath Chits} (glass ampoules knotted with thread) earned by ferry work, given for rescues; spend 1 to resist a name-taking effect or to cross a \emph{Ghost-Ferry Slip} after curfew.
    \item Holding 3+ of either paints a target: begin \emph{Smugglers’ Interest} [4] or \emph{Clerks’ Audit} [4] (GM choice).
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Start-of-Scene Bell Count (1d6):}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Short Peal:} Bell-lines vigilant; +1 assist die to any action that cites posted bell-code.
    \item \emph{Damp Tongues:} Bells mute; first alarm or warning \emph{fails}, but you may slip one minor infraction unnoticed.
    \item \emph{Off-Note:} A cracked bell adds \emph{Wrong Bell} as an ambient threat.
    \item \emph{Pilgrims’ Hour:} Procession on the levee; parley starts one step safer, movement one step worse.
    \item \emph{Inspector’s Tour:} \emph{Rite-Purge} advances once unless placated with procedure (Mykkiel/Law leverage helps).
    \item \emph{Ninth Rumor:} Whispers of the forbidden note; the GM may cash any 2 SB as \emph{Ninth Bell Echo} (see below).
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Oath-Works \& Infrastructure (with teeth):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Bell-Book Concord:} Reconciling Legate writs with ringbooks cancels the first \emph{Protectorate Interdiction} this session; on a miss, start \emph{Names Disputed}.
    \item \emph{Salt-Share Muster:} Donating a pan’s output clears 1 segment from \emph{Ward-Salt Short}; mark \emph{Marsh-Quake} +1 as labor shifts.
    \item \emph{Breath-Toll Bridges:} Paying in breath (Breath Chit) lets one PC ignore \emph{Witchlight Count} for a crossing; the bridge “remembers” and will not accept that PC’s breath again this arc.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Bell Office (signals, gossip, reckoning):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item At each new leg, roll 1d6:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \emph{Mirror Drift:} Codeleaf is a day out of date; -1 die to evade patrols unless updated at a Pall tower.
      \item \emph{Salt Theft:} Pans struck overnight; accept delay to assist repairs (earn 1 \emph{Ward Salt}) or start \emph{Salt Audit}.
      \item \emph{Quiet Ferry:} A \emph{Ghost-Ferry Slip} runs under curfew; cross free once, then tick \emph{Protectorate Interdiction}.
      \item \emph{Warden Wake:} Bells toll names you carry; reveal a concealed identity or begin \emph{Names Disputed}.
      \item \emph{Linn Smoke}: reed-line signals of a raid; +1 Position to avoid it or +1 Effect to intercept (choose).
      \item \emph{Dire Breath}: the Weeping Gate exhales; introduce \emph{Tide-Mist} at controlled strength for this scene.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Plug-in SB Conversions (Mistlands flavor):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Any 1 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Fog Thickens:} visibility band worsens one step for \emph{everyone}.
    \item Any 2 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Bell Miscount:} a posted code is wrong this scene; cancel one enemy assist or void one writ.
    \item 3+ SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Ninth Bell Echo:} a forbidden overtone opens a side path \emph{or} calls something through; GM advances \emph{Ninth Peal} once.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Reputation Echoes (soft power):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Bell-Trusted:} First levee checkpoint begins one step safer; clerks scrutinize coin-ledgers (treat first commerce action one step worse).
    \item \emph{Salt-Steady:} +1 Effect calming crowds on causeys; \emph{Rite-Purge} starts at +1 if you snub Aeler procedure in public.
    \item \emph{Breath-Kind:} Once/session negate a name-taking consequence for an NPC; mist remembers the debt (GM adds a future call-in).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
