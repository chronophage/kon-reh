\chapter{Mistlands --- ``Bells, Salt, and Breath'' Generator}
\label{chap:mistlands}

\section*{Spades --- Places (fens, levees, bell-lines, shoreworks)}
\label{sec:mistlands-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Reed-fen causey with chalked ward-runes on every milestone.
\item Bell-Line levee---iron posts, eight bells per span; one bracket is empty.
\item Ghost-ferry slip where the rope crosses black water; fares paid in salt.
\item Pall Watch-tower on piles above the mire; mirrors face west to the Direwood.
\item Mist-chapel on stilted planks; votive lanterns gutter under damp rafters.
\item Dead-cut canal (old imperial ditch) now patrolled by eel boats and law.
\item Drowned-copse shore; root-tangles clutch the tide like old hands.
\item Fogmill ridge---wind vanes vanish into cloud; gears hiss like prayers.
\item Salt-pan terraces patched with peat; ward-salt dries under nets.
\item[J] Protectorate Fort-Stair of stacked timber and stone, flags swallowed by mist.
\item[Q] Witchlight Bridge over a black runnel; the ninth plank is ``counted'' but unseen.
\item[K] High-Mist Pass through the Aelerians; cairns ringed in iron nails.
\item[A] Weeping Gate---western palisade facing the Direwood, bells wired to the bones of trees.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (wardens, ferrymen, Aeler rule, neighbors)}
\label{sec:mistlands-people}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Reed-cutter with peat-black hands and a precise opinion on fog.
\item Salt-monk who blesses pans and keeps the ward-measure honest.
\item Bell-warden whose ringbook decides which notes keep which ghosts.
\item Oath-ferryman collecting fares in salt and names; remembers both.
\item Lantern acolyte of the Light who trims wicks and arguments.
\item Linn mist-pilot who can ghost a longship through reed-lace---if paid.
\item Protectorate clerk (Aeler) with oilskin ledgers and a narrow smile.
\item Shroud-diver who harvests tokens from drowned fields before dawn.
\item Direwood refugee with a cold breath and colder stories.
\item[J] Fog-knight of the Pall---cavalry that rides levee crowns by bellcode.
\item[Q] Legate of the Mists (Aeler governor), equal parts mercy and decree.
\item[K] Lord Warden of the Fens, local strong hand sworn to the Legate's seal.
\item[A] Mist-Seer who bargains breath for answers; candles shorten when she speaks.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (undead, weather, law, neighbors)}
\label{sec:mistlands-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Ground-mist lifts off the fen and eats tracks by the yard.
\item Witchlights try to count you; step wrong and the bridge forgets you.
\item Ward-salt short---pans go green; bells ring, nothing answers.
\item Wrong bell---a cracked note opens a door the Legate can't close.
\item Linn raid slips the reed-maze; hearths douse, horns travel.
\item Direwood moan at dusk; the Weeping Gate ropes go taut by themselves.
\item Valewood wind crosses the Aberderrin---voices sweet, landmarks false.
\item Bell-line failure on the levee; a wraith steps across like it owns the road.
\item Marsh-quake---sod heaves, a dyke slumps; proofs and bodies sink together.
\item[J] Protectorate interdiction---all ferries sealed ``until review.''
\item[Q] Rite-purge: inspectors call local customs heresy; tempers at a boil.
\item[K] General alarm---the Pall horns sound; every lantern becomes law.
\item[A] Tide-mist rolls from the Aberderrin; spirits ride the white and won't be named.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (passes, seals, tokens, priority)}
\label{sec:mistlands-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Ward-salt allotment---pure measure enough to draw a safe circle (once).
\item Ferry token---cross a named black runnel regardless of curfew.
\item Bell-key---unlock and set one bell on the Line to your note.
\item Lantern writ---lawful travel at night along a levee crown with escort.
\item Exorcist's seal---a stamped clause that downgrades ``haunt'' to ``nuisance.''
\item Fog-beacon codeleaf---today's mirror and horn sequences.
\item Protectorate mark---priority rations and rope from Fort-Stair stores.
\item Wraith-indemnity---legal immunity for actions taken under apparition threat.
\item Bone-field license---salvage rights at a drowned hamlet (with witnesses).
\item[J] Refuge-right---move a named household through the Gate unchallenged.
\item[Q] Private audience with the Legate; one whisper exits as policy.
\item[K] Warden's commission---raise levee guards; local doors open, purses too.
\item[A] Pall Indulgence---temporary exception to ward law, spoken and sealed by bell.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:mistlands-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until all four suits appear: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (passes/seals/tokens) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo breath and boundary---bells answering each other across water, salt that won't quite dry, voices that return a heartbeat late.
\end{itemize}
