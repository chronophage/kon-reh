\section{Mistlands --- ``Bells, Salt, and Breath''}
\label{chap:mistlands}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
The Mistlands lie north of the Aelerian mountains, where the Aberderrin Sea laps against reed-fens and drowned shores. It is a Protectorate of the Aeler, but their iron passes only hold the southern roads---the land itself belongs to fog and bells. Every levee hums with ward-notes, every ferry takes salt as tithe, and every shadow is measured against the Direwood's endless breath. The people here live by the weight of salt, the echo of bells, and the hope that their names will not be spoken by the mists.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:mistlands-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (passes/seals/tokens) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{breath and boundary}---bells answering across water, salt that won't dry, voices returning late.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Breath-Toll:} Many claim mist remembers every breath. Travelers hold breath crossing bridges, fearing mist will count them wrong.
\item \textbf{Salt as Promise:} Handful of salt is more than warding---it is vow. Spill on plank or stone swears safety; break it, invite Direwood's claim.
\item \textbf{The Ninth Bell:} Legends say ninth bell once rang on Line. Note not in ringbooks; no warden speaks of it. Some nights, though, it rings---gates open where none should be.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In the Mistlands, power flows through ritual, warding, and the careful balance between the living and the dead. The Aeler Protectorate maintains nominal control through military presence and legal frameworks, but true authority lies with those who understand the bells, the salt, and the breath of the land itself. Local wardens, salt-monks, and bell-keepers hold sway over daily life, while the Legate of the Mists mediates between imperial law and ancient custom.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in the Mistlands revolves around protection---from mist, from spirits, from the encroaching forest. Rewards often take the form of tokens, seals, or safe passage that can be leveraged into greater security. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (salt, bells, lanterns) that can be challenged, depleted, or voided.
\item Let rival factions issue conflicting protections, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the levees, ferries, and watchtowers as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of the old ways determines success.
\end{itemize}
In the Mistlands, your safety is your standing, and your standing depends on who remembers your name.
