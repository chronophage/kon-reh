\section{Thepyrgos --- ``City of a Thousand Stairs'' Generator}
\label{chap:thepyrgos}

Thepyrgos is both realm and city, a former province whose capital rises in tiers of towers, terraces, and endless stairs above the Dolmis shore. Once an Utar bastion, now a nation unto itself, it is famed for its universities, libraries, and debating synods, where precedent and philosophy weigh as much as pikes or coin. Every stone stair carries the echo of old campaigns and civic quarrels, every bell carries law across the wind. Here, authority climbs as much as it rules: archons elected by the city’s wards, synods decreeing rites and edicts, guilds policing ropes, cranes, and chains. In Thepyrgos, height is hierarchy, sound is sovereignty, and law is etched into every rung.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (edicts, quakes, chains, wind)}
\label{sec:thepyrgos-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Tremor---hairline cracks race down a stair; crowds freeze.
\item Iconoclast riot in the Tower Quarter; pigments and teeth fly.
\item Chain jam at the barbican; capstan pins shear at the worst time.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:thepyrgos-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (keys/rights/passes) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo height \& sound motifs---bells that carry, wind that remembers, and stairs that echo with purpose.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\label{sec:thepyrgos-features}

\paragraph{Bell-Law}
Bells are more than signals: they are law made sound. Once per session, invoking a bellmark or tower bell can summon watch, levy, or decree. But false rings stain reputation; the Synod may call inquiry.

\paragraph{Stair-Rights}
Every stair is owned, owed, or leased. Players carrying the right token may bypass barricades or tolls; without it, disputes escalate quickly. The wrong stair climbed without leave can spark riot or duel.

\paragraph{Synod Edicts}
The Synod’s voice reshapes daily life. Once per session, a Synod decree may grant or strip rights: a chant forbidden, a symbol proscribed, a stair sealed. Such rulings create both leverage and risk in equal measure.
