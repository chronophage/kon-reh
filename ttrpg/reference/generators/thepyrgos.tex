\section{Thepyrgos --- ``City of a Thousand Stairs''}
\label{chap:thepyrgos}

\subsection*{Elite (The Archon)}
\textit{``Every stair climbed is a word in the great conversation between earth and sky. This city is not built – it is grown, stone by stone, law by law, until the very architecture speaks wisdom.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Bell-runner child whose feet know every stair by heart)}
\textit{``I know every step that creaks a warning and every landing that whispers gossip. The bells tell the city's mood better than any lord – three chimes means business, six means trouble.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Thepyrgos is both realm and city, a former province whose capital rises in tiers of towers, terraces, and endless stairs above the Dolmis shore. Once an Utar bastion, now a nation unto itself, it is famed for its universities, libraries, and debating synods, where precedent and philosophy weigh as much as pikes or coin. Every stone stair carries the echo of old campaigns and civic quarrels, every bell carries law across the wind. Here, authority climbs as much as it rules: archons elected by the city's wards, synods decreeing rites and edicts, guilds policing ropes, cranes, and chains. In Thepyrgos, height is hierarchy, sound is sovereignty, and law is etched into every rung.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:thepyrgos-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (keys/rites/papers) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{height \& sound} motifs---bells that carry, wind that remembers, stairs that echo with purpose.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bell-Law:} Bells are law made sound. Once per session, bellmark/tower bell summons watch, levy, decree. False rings stain reputation; Synod may inquire.
\item \textbf{Stair-Rights:} Every stair owned, owed, or leased. Token bypasses barricades/tolls; wrong stair climbed without leave sparks riot or duel.
\item \textbf{Synod Edicts:} Voice reshapes daily life. Once per session, decree grants/strips rights: chant forbidden, symbol proscribed, stair sealed. Rulings create leverage and risk.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Thepyrgos, power flows through elevation, education, and the precise application of law. The Archon maintains authority through the complex web of guilds, synods, and civic institutions that govern every aspect of vertical life. Social mobility is literally upward mobility, with stair-rights, bellmarks, and archive access serving as both currency and status symbols.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Thepyrgos revolves around access---to towers, to knowledge, to the right to climb. Rewards often take the form of keys, passes, or legal exemptions that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, keys, papers) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival guilds issue conflicting rights, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the synods, towers, and staircases as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of law and custom determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Thepyrgos, your ascent is your standing, and your standing determines whether you rise or fall.

% ====== THEPYRGOS: PLUG-IN EXTENSIONS (STAIRS, SYNODS, & SCHOLARLY POWER) ======

\subsection*{Extensions (Plug-in)}
\label{sec:thepyrgos-extensions}

  \item \textbf{Ladder-Law Dial (Orthodoxy \(\leftrightarrow\) Inquiry):} Track how the party moves between civic orthodoxy and free scholarship.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Orthodoxy High:} +1 Position when invoking bell-law, permits, or precedent; first unsanctioned working or trespass into a restricted tier starts one step worse.
    \item \emph{Inquiry High:} +1 Effect on research, invention, or ritual improvisation; first public petition or legal appeal each session starts one step worse.
    \item Center the dial by sponsoring a public colloquy, repairing a stair for common use, or submitting findings to Synod review.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{College Quick-Prep (pick 1–2 to flavor a scene):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{College of Chains \& Loads:} cranes, engines, siege physics; \emph{perk:} one free \textbf{Crane Allotment} use/session on campus.
    \item \emph{College of Keys (Library):} restricted stacks, oath-ladders; \emph{perk:} start research one step safer if you obey rung-rites.
    \item \emph{College of Augury \& Flame:} beacon mathematics, bell acoustics, safe‐fire theorems; \emph{perk:} once/session read smoke or bell for a true omen.
    \item \emph{Collegium Nomikon (Law):} citation duels, case orations; \emph{perk:} treat a \textbf{Lock/Barrier} as a paperwork obstacle instead.
    \item \emph{Lethai-thora Lyceum:} refugee high-elves; luminous script, long-memory magic; \emph{perk:} +1 die to diplomacy/translation with fae or ancient sources.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Scholastic Procedure (fast research):}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Declare \emph{Field} (Keys, Chains, Flame, Nomikon, Lyceum).
    \item Make a \emph{Study} action: on a hit, fill a \textbf{Thesis} clock (4/6/8 by scope) and take a one-use \emph{Citation Edge} (+1d or improved Effect when you apply the finding). On a miss, mark \emph{Rector’s Notice} [2] and a rival advances their claim by 1.
    \item Cash the \emph{Citation Edge} by naming your source (fictionalize a shelf, bell, or professor).
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Debate \& Edict (Synod micro-court):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Lay three \emph{stones}: \textbf{Precedent}, \textbf{Public Good}, \textbf{Piety}. A compelling proof moves a stone to you.
    \item Win any two to secure a temporary \textbf{Synod Indulgence}, \textbf{Bellmark}, or \textbf{Archive Hour}.
    \item \emph{Nomophylax’s Interjection (2 SB or favor):} flip \textbf{Precedent} but begin \emph{Censure Murmurs} [4] with that guild.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Stair Chase (vertical pursuit):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Two clocks: \emph{Gain the Height} vs \emph{Pinned on the Rungs} (size by highest rank in your seed).
    \item Choose a lane each exchange: \emph{Public Stair} (crowds), \emph{Service Ladder} (hazards), \emph{Rope-Crane} (speed, exposure).
    \item Advantage: Public\(\,\triangleright\,\)Rope (cover), Rope\(\,\triangleright\,\)Service (speed), Service\(\,\triangleright\,\)Public (shortcuts).
    \item \emph{Bell-Roll (1 SB):} shift lane or erase your last segment on \emph{Gain the Height} as the watch responds.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Refuge \& Friction (Lethai-thora):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Refuge Grant:} once/session, convert a social failure with Lethai-thora scholars into mixed success if you offer memory (a written recollection, heirloom, or name) for their archive.
    \item \emph{Old Wounds:} when a Club cites \textbf{Iconoclast Riot} or \textbf{Exarch’s Claim}, start \emph{Sanctuary Tension} [4]; at 4, the Lyceum closes to non-vetted entrants until cooled by service or apology.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Ritual on the Rungs (safe-ish magic):}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Mark the Rung} (chalk, bell, token) and name the \emph{Ascent} (what the spell changes).
    \item Pay a \emph{Stair Cost}: breath (fatigue), blood (harm 1), or paper (forfeit a Diamond until end of session).
    \item On success: improved Effect; on consequence: stairs demand tithe—add \emph{Rope Fray} [2] or \emph{Bell Debt} [2].
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Start-of-Scene Signals (1d6):}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Clear Bells:} first legal appeal gains +1 die.
    \item \emph{Crosswind:} climbing faster; stealth worse.
    \item \emph{Scholars’ Strike:} research starts one step worse; street support one step better.
    \item \emph{Beacon Test:} a true omen if you read smoke; -1 die to any lie spoken outdoors.
    \item \emph{Water Ration:} \textbf{Cistern Draw-Right} counts double value today.
    \item \emph{Exarch’s Envoy:} papers begin safer; magic begins harsher.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Plug-in SB Conversions (Thepyrgos flavor):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 1 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Wrong Stair}: detour adds a tick to \emph{Pinned on the Rungs} or imposes -1d on a time-sensitive action.
    \item 2 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Cited Against}: a rival produces a ruling; increase DV by 1 unless you counter-cite or bribe a clerk.
    \item 3+ SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Bell Sanction}: Synod freezes one permit/pass; swap a Diamond you hold for a lesser one until atonement.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Reputation Echoes:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Stair-Favored:} once/session downgrade a fall/collapse outcome; next rope/crane scene starts with \emph{Rope Fray} [1].
    \item \emph{Bell-Trusted:} +1 die calling watch or proclaiming edict; any false alarm adds \emph{Censure Murmurs} [2].
    \item \emph{Collegial:} +1 die on campus bargains; off-campus officials start one step more suspicious.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
