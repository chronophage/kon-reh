\section{Thepyrgos --- ``City of a Thousand Stairs''}
\label{chap:thepyrgos}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Thepyrgos is both realm and city, a former province whose capital rises in tiers of towers, terraces, and endless stairs above the Dolmis shore. Once an Utar bastion, now a nation unto itself, it is famed for its universities, libraries, and debating synods, where precedent and philosophy weigh as much as pikes or coin. Every stone stair carries the echo of old campaigns and civic quarrels, every bell carries law across the wind. Here, authority climbs as much as it rules: archons elected by the city's wards, synods decreeing rites and edicts, guilds policing ropes, cranes, and chains. In Thepyrgos, height is hierarchy, sound is sovereignty, and law is etched into every rung.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:thepyrgos-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (keys/rites/papers) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{height \& sound} motifs---bells that carry, wind that remembers, stairs that echo with purpose.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bell-Law:} Bells are law made sound. Once per session, bellmark/tower bell summons watch, levy, decree. False rings stain reputation; Synod may inquire.
\item \textbf{Stair-Rights:} Every stair owned, owed, or leased. Token bypasses barricades/tolls; wrong stair climbed without leave sparks riot or duel.
\item \textbf{Synod Edicts:} Voice reshapes daily life. Once per session, decree grants/strips rights: chant forbidden, symbol proscribed, stair sealed. Rulings create leverage and risk.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Thepyrgos, power flows through elevation, education, and the precise application of law. The Archon maintains authority through the complex web of guilds, synods, and civic institutions that govern every aspect of vertical life. Social mobility is literally upward mobility, with stair-rights, bellmarks, and archive access serving as both currency and status symbols.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Thepyrgos revolves around access---to towers, to knowledge, to the right to climb. Rewards often take the form of keys, passes, or legal exemptions that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, keys, papers) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival guilds issue conflicting rights, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the synods, towers, and staircases as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of law and custom determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Thepyrgos, your ascent is your standing, and your standing determines whether you rise or fall.

\subsection*{Thepyrgos — City of Stairs}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A Synod terrace overlooking the endless ascent, each stair lit by a candle whose flame whispers names.
\begin{quote}
“In Thepyrgos, every step is confession, and no one reaches the top unjudged.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Synod Hall, a Matriarch of Ladder reads a scroll aloud. ``The Archon falls silent,'' she says. ``And the Beacon Crown sees traitors in the smoke.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Stair cults, smoke augury, beacon law, oath-ladders.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Skip a rung,'' ``Light a forbidden fire,'' ``Denounce a friend.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Beacon Purge''; Community: ``Crowd Panic''; Fracture: ``Stairs Reorder.''
\paragraph{Complications} Smoke writes names; steps vanish; rungs demand blood.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A rooftop refuge; a ladder-born cousin.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The city adds a stair to the sky.
\paragraph{Relief} Quench the beacon; walk every rung properly; disclose the Archon’s last signal.
