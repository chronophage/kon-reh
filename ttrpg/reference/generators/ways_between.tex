\section*{Special Rules for The Ways Between}
\label{sec:ways-between-special-rules}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dream-Logic Navigation}: Any Ace adds a metaphysical requirement (sacrifice, taboo, or transformation) that must be fulfilled to pass.
\item \textbf{Memory Currency}: Diamonds can be traded for information about other travelers or previous paths taken.
\item \textbf{Time-Drift}: Any 2-4 indicates the path moves through time as well as space; arrival may be before departure.
\item \textbf{Reflection Points}: Any face card means the path shows reflections of alternate choices or possible selves.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Quick Use Notes}
\label{sec:ways-between-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = path feature, Heart = fellow traveler, Club = wayward complication, Diamond = path's gift.
\item Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (blessings/rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo dream-road motifs---reflections that lie, paths that remember, destinations that choose the traveler.
\item If any A appears, echo veil \& echo motifs---shadows that speak, paths that judge, and destinations that remember every footfall.
\item The Ways Between always take you where you need to go, not necessarily where you want to go.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Integration Options for The Ways Between}
\label{sec:ways-between-integration}

\subsection*{High-Level Spell: Wayfarer's Passage}
\textbf{Cost}: 20 XP, 1/campaign \\
\textbf{Requirements}: Wits 5, Arcana 4, Spirit 3+ \\
\textbf{Effect}: Step directly onto the Ways Between, traveling instantly between any two locations you have personally visited. No roll required. \\
\textbf{Epic Hook --- The Path Remembers}: Each use creates a permanent metaphysical tether between the locations. The GM starts/advances a 6-segment \textbf{Wayward Connections} Front. Scenes involving either location may be influenced by events at the other. \\
\textbf{Deck Hooks}: Treat any Valewood/Theona 9s drawn in travel scenes as Way-signs. Spending a local guide (e.g., Waymark Token) can redirect an unwanted tether to a more useful location.

\subsection*{Prestige Background: Keeper of the Crossroads}
\textbf{Requires}: Mediate three major conflicts at different crossroads; deep tie to wayward places. \\
\textbf{Talent --- Judge of Paths (8 XP)}: Once/session at any crossroads or junction, read the true nature of all available paths. Ask three questions about where each leads and what price must be paid. On a miss, GM banks +2 SB as path-dissonance. \\
\textbf{Perk (choose 1, once/session)}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Redirect one path's complication to a different traveler.
    \item Grant Safe Passage to one group through your crossroads this scene.
    \item Speak the True Names of all paths meeting at this junction.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Scene Keys}: Major Crossroads, Dream-Threshold, Convergence Point \\
\textbf{Hooks (GM on SB spend in keyed scenes)}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A path you redirected curses your judgment; future navigation rolls at -1 DV.
    \item The crossroads itself becomes a character, demanding a sacrifice for continued service.
    \item Another Keeper challenges your authority; paths begin to shift allegiances.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Invite}: "The roads remember your name."

\subsection*{Mid-Tier Talent: Dream-Road Walker}
\textbf{Cost}: 7 XP \\
\textbf{Requirements}: Spirit 3+, any travel-related skill at level 2+ \\
\textbf{Effect}: Once/session, when lost or blocked, step briefly onto the Ways Between. Roll Spirit + relevant travel skill. On success, find a shortcut that bypasses the current obstacle and grants DV -1 to the next travel action. On failure, GM banks +1 SB as path-disorientation. \\
\textbf{Backlash}: The shortcut leads through someone else's unfinished business---you arrive carrying a minor obligation or taboo.

\subsection*{Cultural Talent: Child of the Crossroads}
\textbf{Cost}: 5 XP (counts as racial talent) \\
\textbf{Requirements}: Born at a crossroads or major junction; raised by travelers \\
\textbf{Effect}: You instinctively know the emotional weight of any path. Gain +1 die to all navigation rolls and can always sense the direction of the "truest" path available, even if it's not the shortest. \\
\textbf{Downside}: Major crossroads and junctions always generate 1 SB when you're present, as other travelers are drawn to your natural wayfinding ability.

\subsection*{Ritual Magic: Calling the Long Road}
\textbf{Art}: Umbramancy/Veil (DV 3) \\
\textbf{Effect}: Summon a temporary path onto the Ways Between, allowing one allied group to bypass a major obstacle. The path lasts one scene but requires a guide who knows the way. \\
\textbf{Backlash}: 1-2 SB path is unstable, causing disorientation; 3-4 SB the path leads through dangerous metaphor; 5+ SB the path becomes permanent and starts attracting unwanted traffic.

\subsection*{Asset Integration: Roadwarden's Charter}
\textbf{Type}: Major Off-Screen Asset (12 XP) \\
\textbf{Effect}: Official authority over a section of the Ways Between. Once per session, ensure safe passage for allies through your territory. Off-Screen: Resolve one major travel complication automatically, but generate 1 SB for crew as path-politics catch up. \\
\textbf{Maintenance}: Must periodically patrol your section and mediate disputes between paths.

\subsection*{Magic Item: Compass of True Directions}
\textbf{Effect}: Points toward the path that serves your deepest need rather than your stated destination. Once per session, ignore the first SB generated by a travel complication. \\
\textbf{Curse}: Cannot be lied to about destinations---the compass grows heavier with each deception until the truth is spoken.

\subsection*{Follower Integration: Wayward Guide}
\textbf{Cap}: 4 \\
\textbf{Specialty}: Navigation through metaphysical territories \\
\textbf{Effect}: Adds +2 assist dice to any travel roll involving non-physical navigation (dream-paths, metaphorical journeys, time-drift corridors). \\
\textbf{Risk}: 2+ SB spent on travel actions may cause the guide to become lost in the deeper paths, requiring a rescue mission.
