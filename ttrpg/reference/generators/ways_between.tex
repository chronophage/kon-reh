\section{The Ways Between --- ``Spiritways \& Veilways''}
\label{chap:ways-between}

\subsection*{Elite (The Wayfinder)}
\textit{``I exist only in the moment of choice, the breath between one path and another. To guide here is to understand that every way leads somewhere, but only the wise know which somethings are worth the journey.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Lost Pilgrim who thinks they're going home but forgot where)}
\textit{``The paths here don't care where you think you're going – they care where you need to be. Best walk softly and listen to what the waystones whisper when you pass.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Between Death and Dreams lies a country of crossings. Roads remember promises; milestones remember names you never spoke. The Ways Between do not measure miles---they measure choices. Walk softly, pay what the path asks, and mind which version of you arrives.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Path/Crossing/Threshold)} Mist-shrouded ford where water runs uphill; footsteps echo backwards; bone-lit corridor where shadows walk walls.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:ways-between-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (true names/safe passages/waywisdom) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{dream-road} motifs---reflections that lie, paths that judge, destinations that choose traveler.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dream-Logic Navigation:} Any Ace introduces metaphysical requirement (sacrifice, taboo, exchange) that must be satisfied to pass. Name it at table; road will enforce it.
\item \textbf{Reflection Points:} Face cards show alternate selves or unlived choices. Treat as temporary NPCs or scene tags that can help, hinder, or tempt.
\item \textbf{Memory Currency:} Diamonds may be traded for knowledge or safe passage as if they were memories. Describe memory paid; path (or keeper) pays in kind.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In the Ways Between, power flows through understanding the metaphysical nature of paths, the ability to navigate dream-logic, and the careful management of obligations and truths. The true authorities are those who know the True Names of paths, can mediate between alternate versions of travelers, and understand the currency of memory and choice. Power here is not about commanding others, but about understanding the fundamental nature of journey and destination.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in the Ways Between revolves around guidance, safe passage, and the ability to navigate metaphysical requirements. Rewards often take the form of waymarks, tokens, and knowledge that can be leveraged into greater understanding. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, compasses, lights) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival guides issue conflicting directions, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the crossroads, waystations, and thresholds as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of path-logic determines success.
\end{itemize}
In the Ways Between, your understanding is your power, and your power determines whether you walk or are walked.

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Ways Between — Spiritways and Veilways}
\textbf{Starting Location:} A crossroad shrine of black glass stones, where travelers meet their reflections coming the other way.
\begin{quote}
“In the Ways Between, direction is prayer, and memory the toll you pay to arrive.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Crossroads, a Backwards Pilgrim walks toward them. ``The Thirteenth Stone speaks,'' they say. ``But the path chooses who arrives.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Reverse time, directional law, pilgrim riddles, stone tongues.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Turn around,'' ``Step off the path,'' ``Answer the stone’s question with a lie.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Fracture: ``Paths Decide''; Threat: ``Pilgrim Reckoning''; Anchor: ``Wayhouse Refuge.''
\paragraph{Complications} Footprints arrive before feet; milestones hum; maps eat corners.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A wayhouse keeper; a holy token.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} The road passes through the party.
\paragraph{Relief} Walk the path backward together; speak the truth you avoid; leave a cherished thing at the Stone.
\subsection*{Path-Moves \& Procedures}

\paragraph{Weighing of Steps (Travel Move)}
When the company enters a liminal path (Mist-Ford, Bone Corridor, etc.), choose one:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Pay the Toll:} Each PC names a small truth or a fond memory (GM: 1 SB banked, +1 Position on navigation).
  \item \textbf{Refuse the Toll:} +1d on Speed, but start a \textbf{Way-Debt (4)} clock.
  \item \textbf{Bargain the Toll:} Trade a \emph{Diamond} reward as if it were a memory (see Memory Exchange, below); cancel one imminent \emph{Club} card in this scene.
\end{itemize}
When \textbf{Way-Debt} fills, trigger \emph{Crossroads Judgment} at the next junction.

\paragraph{Reflection Duel (Social/Moral Test)}
When confronted by an alternate self or \emph{Reflection Point}, state what that self wants from you and roll your best social action.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Success:} Gain a \emph{Guide-Light} tag for the scene and clear 1 tick from \textbf{Paths Decide}.
  \item \textbf{Mixed:} Trade places for one exchange or take a \textbf{Condition: Disoriented}.
  \item \textbf{Miss:} The reflection walks away with one of your \emph{Diamonds} (GM picks the most narratively apt).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Way-Sanctuary (Making Camp)}
If you can name a waystone’s title (e.g., “Mourner’s Mile,” “Bridge of First Promises”), you may establish a \textbf{Safe Haven}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Spend 1 \emph{Diamond} or 1 vivid memory (see table) to lock out \emph{Clubs} until dawn.
  \item Anyone who sleeps here must either \emph{forget} a minor slight or \emph{remember} a painful truth; mark \textbf{Paths Decide} down by 1 tick.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Memory Exchange (Rates \& Risks)}

\begin{tabular}{p{0.36\textwidth} p{0.28\textwidth} p{0.30\textwidth}}
\textbf{Memory Offered} & \textbf{Buys You} & \textbf{Side Effect} \\
\hline
A childhood smell, a nickname & +1 Position on one crossing & A familiar place feels strange for a scene \\
A first failure or small betrayal & Cancel one minor Complication & You gain a \emph{tell} (the Ways recognize you) \\
A true fear you’ve never said & \emph{Guide-Light} or \emph{Way-Cord}-like effect & A dream pursues you for 1–3 nights \\
A kept promise’s details & \emph{Safe Passage} for the party & NPC tied to that promise misremembers you \\
The meaning of a scar & Convert one \emph{Club} into \emph{Trace} only & Scar “moves” (cosmetic) until next dawn \\
A perfect day (all details) & Treat next \emph{Heart} face as an ally & Start \textbf{Dream-Bleed (3)} on the map \\
\end{tabular}

\medskip

\textbf{Exchange Rule:} If you pay the same \emph{kind} of memory twice in a journey, start \textbf{Hollowing (4)}. When it fills, you gain the \emph{Backwards Pilgrim} tag until you reclaim what was lost.
\subsection*{Way-Keys \& Taboos (d6)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Speak Last}: Only the final word said at a gate is true; others are “practice.” First speakers take -1d on next test.
\item \textbf{Step Odd}: Crossings require odd-numbered steps; even counts loop you one scene.
\item \textbf{Name Nothing}: True names wake \emph{Name-Theft}; use titles or lose a \emph{Diamond}.
\item \textbf{Wet Iron}: A drop of water on iron cancels one glamour once per scene.
\item \textbf{Back Gift}: Leave something behind to go forward; refuse and tick \textbf{Way-Debt}.
\item \textbf{Answer Bent}: Answer a stone’s question with a metaphor, not fact, or trigger \emph{Truth Payment}.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Omens \& Atmospherics (d8)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Footprints precede the party by three paces, then vanish. 
\item Milestones hum in harmony with a PC’s heartbeat.
\item Shadows detach to point at a different path.
\item A map eats its corner and reveals a new legend mark.
\item Wind smells like a long-forgotten room.
\item A bell rings where there is no bell; time skips one breath.
\item You meet someone you haven’t decided to be yet.
\item A coin lands on its edge and stays that way until the next choice.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Cross-Regional Conversions (Using Diamonds Across the Map)}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Valewood:} \emph{Road's Name} may count as a \emph{Valeheart Clause} once if spoken under leaves; doing so creates \textbf{Court Tithe (2)}.
\item \textbf{Mistlands:} \emph{Grace Passage} functions as \emph{Pall Indulgence} over one levee crown at night; ring a bell after or start \textbf{Witchlight Count}.
\item \textbf{Vhasia:} \emph{Way-Wisdom} can be presented as “pilgrim right” to bypass one \emph{Interdict} barrier; begin \textbf{Parlement Divided} tick.
\item \textbf{Viterra:} \emph{Passage Token} can be notarized into a temporary \emph{Ferry Priority}; on use, advance \textbf{Border-Lace}.
\item \textbf{Ubral:} \emph{Memory-Anchor} counts as \emph{Guest-Token} at one hearth if you recount a family road-tale.
\item \textbf{Silkstrand:} \emph{Path-Cutter} doubles as a night-boat route once; spend 1 favor with a smuggler or trigger \emph{Seal Counterfeit}.
\item \textbf{Linn:} \emph{Choice Compass} acts as a \emph{Pilot’s Token} in reed-maze if you pay a name to the water.
\item \textbf{Theona:} \emph{Crossroads Boon} allows counting “eight-and-one” to cross an \emph{Uncounted Bridge} safely once.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Region-Specific SB Addenda (Ways Between)}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Forked Proof:} Evidence splits: one version exonerates, one condemns. Choose which survives into waking.
\item \textbf{Promise Echo:} An oath you overheard… was yours. Honor it or mark \textbf{Way-Debt} +2.
\item \textbf{Borrowed Dawn:} You arrive at sunrise you did not earn; take -1d until you “return” evening with a deed.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{NPC Templates (Quick-Slot)}

\paragraph{Waystation Keeper (Words-Monger)}
\emph{Wants:} To complete a conversation they died before finishing. 
\emph{Sells:} Missing lines of arguments, last pages of letters. 
\emph{Cost:} One unsent message or a truth about why you never sent it.

\paragraph{Dead-Road Beadle}
\emph{Wants:} Proper order: living to inns, dead to ferries. 
\emph{Sells:} Escorts, obol accounting, corpse-rights. 
\emph{Cost:} A coin that mattered (keepsake, not currency).

\paragraph{Road’s Child}
\emph{Wants:} To see a crossroads they’ve never met. 
\emph{Gives:} +1 Position if you follow their game rules. 
\emph{Twist:} They can’t cross consecrated thresholds.
\subsection*{Escalation Clocks}

\paragraph{Paths Decide (6)}
1–2: Waymarks contradict gently. \quad
3–4: An alternate self appears with a better plan. \quad
5: Route demands a sacrifice named by the GM. \quad
6: The Wayfinder arrives; accept their chosen destination or pay \emph{Road’s Name} to defy it.

\paragraph{Pilgrim Reckoning (4)}
1: You are recognized by a procession that hasn’t started. \quad
2–3: Their destination is yours now. \quad
4: Your \emph{Safe Haven} is requisitioned as a shrine.

\paragraph{Way-Debt (4)}
1: Prices rise (memories cost one step higher). \quad
2–3: A \emph{Toll-Taker} marks you with chalk only spirits can see. \quad
4: \emph{Forbidden Path} opens; refusing it imposes -1 Position until dawn.
\subsection*{Encounter Seeds (1–3 sentences)}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Promise Bridge’s Receipt:} An old vow you never spoke was logged here; to cross, define when you would have sworn it and to whom.
\item \textbf{Thirteenth Stone Auction:} The stone sells three possible endings; each buyer is you from a different failure.
\item \textbf{Bone Corridor Choir:} Shadows sing a name wrong by one letter; correct it and gain \emph{Truth-Compass}, ignore it and start \textbf{Name-Theft}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Designer Hooks (Optional)}

\paragraph{True-Name Craft}
Once per journey, a PC may \emph{forge} a minor way-name (e.g., “Courier’s Cut”) by binding a shared memory to a short route:
\begin{itemize}
\item Spend 1–2 \emph{Diamonds} and narrate the founding memory.
\item Gain +1 Effect on travel using that name. 
\item Each public use adds 1 tick to \textbf{Convergence} as others learn it.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Convergence Event (When Filled)}
All travelers you’ve intersected with arrive at once; resolve three debts (owed, unowed, mistaken) before the junction dissolves.

% ====== WAYS BETWEEN: LIGHT FLOURISHES + BOSS HOOKS ======

\subsection*{Liminal Flourishes (low-noise, high vibe)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Chalk Whispers:} Waystones sprout faint chalk notes that only answer if you erase one first.
  \item \textbf{Coin on Edge:} Any tossed coin that lands upright marks a \emph{True Choice} nearby.
  \item \textbf{Borrowed Footsteps:} Your echo belongs to someone else; following it grants +1 Position once.
  \item \textbf{Sleeper’s Draft:} Dew beading on mile-markers is drinkable: 1 sip = remember one forgotten detail, but the path remembers \emph{you}.
  \item \textbf{Veil Static:} Hair lifts in still air; that’s two realities brushing. Passing through grants brief \emph{double-sight} (ask one question about the “other” leg).
\end{itemize}

% ====== BOSS GALLERY (three faces of the road) ======
\subsection*{Boss Hooks (three keepers of crossing)}
\paragraph*{The Archivist of Unmade Roads}
\emph{Face:} Cloak stitched from surveyor’s cords, quills like thorns.  
\emph{Wants:} To file every path choice you \emph{didn’t} take.  
\emph{Moves:} Produces \emph{Receipts of Refusal} (paper truths that make alternatives real), files a \emph{Stay of Journey} (travel pauses until a memory is surrendered).  
\emph{Clock—Unfiled Options [4]:} Tick when you bypass a detour. At 4, one \emph{Place} redraws as its “unmade” twin for a scene (GM picks).

\paragraph*{The Toll-Matriarch Beneath the Bridge}
\emph{Face:} Many hands, one voice like wet stone.  
\emph{Wants:} Payment in \emph{untaken apologies} and \emph{unsent letters}.  
\emph{Moves:} Demands \emph{Truth Payment}, grants \emph{Debt-Clearing}—but swaps your burden to a stranger-you.  
\emph{Clock—Balance Due [3]:} Each refused toll ticks +1. At 3, she opens a \emph{Forbidden Path} keyed to your worst rationalization.

\paragraph*{The Wayfinder’s Shadow (Counter-Guide)}
\emph{Face:} Your silhouette, two steps ahead, never quite yours.  
\emph{Wants:} Choices made quickly, not well.  
\emph{Moves:} Calls \emph{Crossroads Judgment} early; offers \emph{Guide-Light} that points to the \emph{easiest} ending.  
\emph{Clock—Haste Mark [4]:} Tick whenever you skip a ritual/taboo. At 4, the Shadow chooses for you once (resolve as if an Ace dictated the cost).

% ====== MICRO-MECHANICS (plug-and-play) ======
\subsection*{Flourishes}
\paragraph*{Choice Dial (Resolve \(\leftrightarrow\) Drift)}
Track the party’s footing between firm intent and wandering.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Resolve High:} +1 Position on \emph{Path Split} tests; first \emph{Dream-Bleed} each session hits harder (start at 2).
  \item \emph{Drift High:} +1 Effect when bargaining with way-entities; first \emph{Truth Payment} each session costs a cherished \emph{detail}.
  \item \emph{Center the Dial:} Name aloud the next choice \emph{and} why you might refuse it; clear 1 from \textbf{Way-Debt}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Counter-Seal (1/scene, if justified)}
Break a single metaphysical instruction (taboo, key, or omen) by presenting a memory in symbol (a token, letter, sketch). Gain +1d on that crossing; GM banks 1 SB \emph{Marked Consequence} to spend when reflections return.

% ====== START-OF-SCENE MURMURS (1d6) ======
\subsection*{Start-of-Scene Murmurs (d6)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Second Sunrise:} light arrives twice; your first miss on navigation becomes mixed.
  \item \emph{Name Draft:} the air steals a syllable; your next lie sounds true once.
  \item \emph{Echo Debt:} your footprints owe a step—skip a square or tick \textbf{Way-Debt} +1.
  \item \emph{Pale Bell:} time hiccups; first \emph{Club} can be delayed to end of scene.
  \item \emph{Traveler’s Chorus:} distant voices agree with you; +1d on appeals to path entities.
  \item \emph{Hollow Weather:} rain that doesn’t wet; conditions look dire but impose no penalties this scene.
\end{enumerate}

% ====== QUICK SEEDS (3) ======
\subsection*{Quick Seeds}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Receipt of Refusal:} The Archivist delivers a stamped paper proving you almost betrayed a friend. To proceed, decide whether that “almost” happened in another you—and pay or tear the receipt.
  \item \textbf{Bridge of Apologies:} The Toll-Matriarch offers \emph{Grace Passage} if each PC speaks an apology never given. One apology is answered—from the wrong voice.
  \item \textbf{Shadow’s Shortcut:} The Wayfinder’s Shadow opens a one-turn \emph{Path-Cutter}; take it and skip a \emph{Club} now, but the skipped scene returns at journey’s end—harder.
\end{itemize}

% ====== CROSS-THRESHOLD ENTANGLEMENTS (tiny, optional) ======
\subsection*{Cross-Threshold Entanglements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Into Valewood:} A \emph{Choice Compass} can be “planted” as a \emph{Truce-Bough} once; doing so starts \emph{Oath-Magnet} +1.
  \item \textbf{Into Viterra:} \emph{Passage Token} notarized becomes a one-use \emph{Ferry Priority}; upon use, a clerk misfiles your name (treat first social as if facing \emph{Audit Freeze}).
  \item \textbf{Into Ubral:} \emph{Memory-Anchor} traded for guest-bread counts as \emph{Guest-Token}, but a cairn remembers the \emph{truth} you gave up (GM banks leverage).
\end{itemize}
