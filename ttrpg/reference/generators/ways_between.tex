\section{The Ways Between --- ``Spiritways \& Veilways''}
\label{chap:ways-between}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
Between Death and Dreams lies a country of crossings. Roads remember promises; milestones remember names you never spoke. The Ways Between do not measure miles---they measure choices. Walk softly, pay what the path asks, and mind which version of you arrives.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:ways-between-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (true names/safe passages/waywisdom) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{dream-road} motifs---reflections that lie, paths that judge, destinations that choose traveler.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dream-Logic Navigation:} Any Ace introduces metaphysical requirement (sacrifice, taboo, exchange) that must be satisfied to pass. Name it at table; road will enforce it.
\item \textbf{Reflection Points:} Face cards show alternate selves or unlived choices. Treat as temporary NPCs or scene tags that can help, hinder, or tempt.
\item \textbf{Memory Currency:} Diamonds may be traded for knowledge or safe passage as if they were memories. Describe memory paid; path (or keeper) pays in kind.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In the Ways Between, power flows through understanding the metaphysical nature of paths, the ability to navigate dream-logic, and the careful management of obligations and truths. The true authorities are those who know the True Names of paths, can mediate between alternate versions of travelers, and understand the currency of memory and choice. Power here is not about commanding others, but about understanding the fundamental nature of journey and destination.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in the Ways Between revolves around guidance, safe passage, and the ability to navigate metaphysical requirements. Rewards often take the form of waymarks, tokens, and knowledge that can be leveraged into greater understanding. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (tokens, compasses, lights) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival guides issue conflicting directions, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the crossroads, waystations, and thresholds as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of path-logic determines success.
\end{itemize}
In the Ways Between, your understanding is your power, and your power determines whether you walk or are walked.
