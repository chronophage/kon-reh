\section{Theona --- ``Three Greens, No Ninth'' Generator}
\label{chap:theona}

\section*{Spades --- Places (ringforts, wells, cliffs, causeways)}
\label{sec:theona-places}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Basalt tide-stairs cut into a cove; everyone steps past the ``missing'' rung.
\item Saint's Well under a hawthorn hung with ribbons and secrets.
\item Fog-wick tower burning peat; the bell plays eight notes, never nine.
\item Black Bog causeway---white stones like teeth; will-lights test your stride.
\item Cliff ringfort over kelp-nets; storm-ladders creak like hymns.
\item Barrow field with standing stones; birds hush at noon.
\item Sea-cave harp: tide-ropes sing under the headland; echoes bargain.
\item Uncounted Bridge, a nine-arch causeway locals tally ``eight-and-one.''
\item Ogham grove---carved pillars arranged around an absent ninth post.
\item[J] Coracle harbor jammed in a notch; upturned boats roof the sheds.
\item[Q] Green Moot Hill (the Three Greens' court): benches of turf, salt wind judges.
\item[K] High Hall of Theona on whale-rib beams; storm banners sleep.
\item[A] Lookout of Three Greens---one cliff where all three isles stand in a single gaze.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Hearts --- People \& Factions (moots, keepers, courts, neighbors)}
\label{sec:theona-people}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Peat-cutter with a steady barrow and steadier gossip.
\item Well-keeper who ties ribbons and unknots feuds.
\item Kelp-netter who reads rip lines like ledgers.
\item Harp-satirist; a few bars can end a career or a war.
\item Wick-warden who tends fog-lamps and counts in eights.
\item Taboo-witness (geas-keeper) who knows which words ruin deals.
\item Island abbot with a saint's bell and a tolerant smile.
\item Green Neighbor---a polite emissary from under the hill, wearing borrowed boots.
\item Coracle-captain of an eight-boat flotilla, swift as rumor.
\item[J] Bride-peacemaker who walks between bloodlines with a silver knife.
\item[Q] Matron of Wells, queen-mother in truth if not in name.
\item[K] Three-Isles King, elected by moots, whale-bone throne and weathered eyes.
\item[A] Lady Beneath the Hawthorn, the unseen queen who bargains in dreams.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Clubs --- Complications/Threats (fog, feud, taboo, sea)}
\label{sec:theona-complications}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Ground-mist erases tracks; horns travel, edges do not.
\item Bog-lights lure a teamster off the causeway; recovery costs time and pride.
\item Spoken geas: no ninth word in parley---or the deal curdles.
\item Salt-rot---the smokehouse fails; fish spoil, tempers rise.
\item Processions collide: saint-day vs hawthorn taboo; shutters slam.
\item Wave-count: the Eighth swells, the Nameless follows---boats tremble.
\item Ringfort wakes; a bone-judge is ``consulted,'' and now you're named.
\item The Ninth Law invoked---something vital cannot be counted, measured, or named.
\item Net-surge in the harbor stairs; kelp wraps ankles and alibis.
\item[J] Bride-theft at the Moot---peace flips to feud; you're caught mid-ritual.
\item[Q] Exile returns with mainland papers; elders arrested ``for progress.''
\item[K] Green Host rides: hooves like drums, cattle scatter, sentries sleep.
\item[A] Great Fog---routes loop, bells lie, every promise takes the long way.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Diamonds --- Rewards/Leverage (blessings, tokens, rights, priority)}
\label{sec:theona-rewards}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Well-blessing---named ford crosses you safely, once.
\item Moot token---an eight-knotted cord; skip any local queue.
\item Harbor-green---painted mark that exempts your boat from the next levy.
\item Hawthorn pass---immunity from a single local taboo (for one scene).
\item Bell-right---lawful ring at a fog-wick summons watchers.
\item Coracle share---crew and oars pledged for one crossing.
\item Ogham ruling---a monk's reading that settles a dispute in your favor.
\item Unnumbered Right---ignore the Ninth prohibition for one action (costs a favor later).
\item Salt-cure license---process scarce fish despite ration edicts.
\item[J] Bride-peace charter---two feuding houses sheath knives for a season.
\item[Q] Private moot with the Matron and the King; whispers become policy.
\item[K] Whale-road escort---eight-oar guards across a Dolmis reach.
\item[A] The Green Favor---one uncanny exception to custom, spoken beneath the hawthorn.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:theona-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until all four suits appear: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5$\rightarrow$4, 6--10$\rightarrow$6, J/Q/K$\rightarrow$8, A$\rightarrow$10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (blessings/tokens/rights) that shift position rather than call for a roll.
\item The ``No Ninth'' custom: whenever a 9 appears in your seed, add an omission to the scene (a missing step, an unsaid name, an unseen guest). If the 9 is a Diamond, you may break the taboo once---but someone will come to collect later.
\item If any A appears, echo green \& count motifs---hawthorn that whispers, bells that miscount, and promises that take the long way home.
\end{itemize}
