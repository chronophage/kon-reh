\section{Theona --- ``Three Greens, No Ninth''}
\label{chap:theona}

\subsection*{Elite (Matron of Wells)}
\textit{``The wells here hold more than water – they hold the dreams and prayers of generations. To govern is to tend these sacred spaces where the living commune with what came before.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Peat-cutter with steady barrow and steadier gossip)}
\textit{``The land here remembers everything, especially what you don't say. Skip the ninth step, forget the ninth name, and the green earth takes note. Best keep your omissions honest.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
The isles of Theona rise green and jagged from the Dolmis, their basalt cliffs wrapped in mists and moorland song. Nominally a duchy sworn to Viterra, in truth the Three Greens heed no crown but their own moots, no law but their taboos. The greatest of these is the silence of Nine: no bell tolls a ninth, no bridge counts that span, no oath dares its syllable. It is said that those who break the ban invite the Green Host, and that debts of nine can never be paid in coin.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Ringfort/Well/Cliff)} Basalt tide-stairs cut into cove; everyone steps past ``missing'' rung; Saint's Well under hawthorn hung with ribbons.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:theona-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (blessings/tokens/rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item The ``No Ninth'' custom: whenever a 9 appears in your seed, add an omission to the scene (a missing step, an unsaid name, an unseen guest). If the 9 is a Diamond, you may break the taboo once---but someone will come to collect later.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{green \& count} motifs---hawthorn that whispers, bells that miscount, promises that take the long way home.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Silent Count:} Players and GMs are encouraged to omit a detail (a name, a step, a tally) when the Ninth appears, echoing Theona's taboo.
\item \textbf{Green Host's Omen:} Any dream-sequence or omen may be framed as ride of Green Host---hoofbeats across sky, wind through moors, sea-spray tasting salt and blood.
\item \textbf{Bride-Peace Feasts:} Weddings, truces, funerals blur; sharing feast can end feud for season---or doom guest if ninth cup poured.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Theona, power flows through ancient custom, sacred spaces, and the careful observance of taboo. The Three Greens maintain their independence through a web of moots, well-keepers, and geas-keepers who ensure the old laws are honored. The King and Matron rule by consensus and tradition, while the unseen Lady Beneath influences events through dreams and whispers.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Theona revolves around blessings, exemptions, and the delicate balance of keeping or breaking taboos. Rewards often take the form of tokens, rights, or divine favor that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (ribbons, tokens, blessings) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival factions issue conflicting exemptions, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the moots, wells, and causeways as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of custom determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Theona, your word is your weave, and your weave determines whether you walk the green path or invite the Host.

\textbf{Starting Location:} A Moot Hill under rain, where vows are carved into stone and knives gleam beside the altar.
\begin{quote}
“In Theona, peace is a ritual, and every word sharpens the blade that seals it.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Moot Hill, a Bride-Peacemaker draws a blade between two bloodlines. ``The ninth vow was never spoken,'' she says. ``But the Green Host remembers.''
\paragraph{Regional Motifs} Vows, moot law, bride-knives, hill spirits.
\paragraph{Whispers to Offer} ``Take the ninth alone,'' ``Name a false witness,'' ``Bury a blade in the wrong earth.''
\paragraph{External Clocks} Threat: ``Green Host Rises''; Community: ``Blood Feud''; Anchor: ``Bride’s Peace.''
\paragraph{Complications} Oath-stones crack; witnesses forget; blades hum.
\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A grandmother-judge; a field sacred to both sides.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} Grass stands up against the wind.
\paragraph{Relief} Speak the ninth vow with a cost; trade life for lineage; sacrifice a claim to reduce Community.

% ====== THEONA: PLUG-IN EXTENSIONS (INSULAR TABOOS & RAIDER PRESSURE) ======

\subsection*{Extensions (Plug-in)}
\label{sec:theona-extensions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Silent Count Dial (Orthodoxy \(\leftrightarrow\) Accommodation):} Track how strictly your party keeps Theonan taboos.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Orthodoxy High:} +1 Position when invoking custom (wells, ribbons, eight-count rites); your first attempt to use foreign papers or clocks starts one step worse.
    \item \emph{Accommodation High:} +1 Effect with outsiders (Viterra clerks, foreign captains, notaries); your first sacred-site action each session begins one step worse.
    \item Center the dial by offering restitution (feast for a slighted house, re-tying ribbons at three wells, or sponsoring a Bride-Peace).
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Omen \& Geas (fast procedure):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item When a \textbf{9} appears in any draw/roll, name \emph{what goes uncounted} in the scene (a step, a witness, a tithe).  
    \item Anyone may \emph{break the silence} once/scene: take +1 die \emph{or} treat a Club as a Diamond, then mark \emph{Green Debt} [4]. When \emph{Green Debt} fills, introduce a \emph{Green Host} complication immediately.
    \item Speaking a \emph{Geas} (simple phrasing): on a hit, target gains +1 Effect when honoring it; on a miss, the geas binds a bystander as well.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Causeway Chase (bog, bridge, or cliff path):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Make two clocks: \emph{Reach the Moot} and \emph{Dragged to the Bog} (size by highest rank in your seed).
    \item Pick a lane each exchange: \emph{Stone Teeth} (causeway), \emph{Mire Edge} (bog), \emph{Cliff Track}.  
    \item Advantage: Stone\(\,\triangleright\,\)Mire ( footing), Mire\(\,\triangleright\,\)Cliff ( cover), Cliff\(\,\triangleright\,\)Stone ( vantage).
    \item \emph{Will-Lights (1 SB):} force a lane change or erase the last segment you filled on \emph{Reach the Moot}.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Moot Contest (quick social court):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Lay three stones: \emph{Custom}, \emph{Kin}, \emph{Cost}. Each proof shifts one stone toward you.
    \item Win any two: you secure a \emph{Theona Diamond} (Well-Blessing, Ogham Ruling, or Moot Token).  
    \item \emph{Harp-Satire (2 SB or favor):} flip one stone, but start \emph{Satire Sticks} [4] against you with that house.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Raider Crossroads (optional hooks):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Linn Raid Pressure:} Convert any \textbf{Linn} \emph{Escort Writ} into a one-time \emph{Whale-Escort} here, then roll once on Theona \emph{Clubs}.
    \item \emph{Ashaani/Sidhi Corsairs:} When foreign sails draw near, you may swap one Theona \emph{Spades} for a \emph{Kahfagia} \emph{Spades} draw; treat beacons as \emph{absent} unless a Wick-Warden spends a \emph{Bell-Right}.
    \item \emph{Viterra Claim:} A Viterra official can convert \emph{Ogham Ruling} to \emph{paper} (temporary recognition) but starts \emph{Mainland Return} [4].
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Start-of-Scene Portents (1d6):}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Eight Bells Only:} next taboo-check gains +1 die if you omit a detail in play.
    \item \emph{Green Neighbor Visits:} first bargain with fae courtesy ignores 1 SB.
    \item \emph{Moot on the Wind:} rumor grants +1 die to \emph{Custom} proofs; -1 die to \emph{Cost}.
    \item \emph{Fog Lifts, Swell Rises:} travel faster; stealth worse.
    \item \emph{Song at the Well:} a blessing is on offer; accept and mark \emph{Green Debt} [1].
    \item \emph{Mainland Clerk Ashore:} paper begins one step safer; sacred acts begin one step worse.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Plug-in SB Conversions (Theona flavor):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 1 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Taboo Tangle:} a word refuses to be said; increase DV by 1 unless you mime/custom-workaround.
    \item 2 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Bog Claims Proof:} a key token/paper is damp, smudged, or lost; switch to \emph{Kin} or \emph{Custom}.
    \item 3+ SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Green Hoofbeats:} enforce an immediate lane swap (Causeway) or summon a \emph{Green Neighbors} witness who demands a price.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Reputation Echoes:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Well-Favored:} once/session treat a failed sacred crossing as a \emph{mixed} result; next foreign parley starts worse.
    \item \emph{Moot-Wise:} +1 die on \emph{Custom} proofs; your rivals gain +1 die citing \emph{Cost}.
    \item \emph{Mainland-Touched:} ignore the first \emph{Spoken Geas} penalty in a scene; local taboos scrutinize you (GM may add 1 SB when you boast).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
