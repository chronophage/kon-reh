\section{Theona --- ``Three Greens, No Ninth''}
\label{chap:theona}

\subsection*{Elite (Matron of Wells)}
\textit{``The wells here hold more than water – they hold the dreams and prayers of generations. To govern is to tend these sacred spaces where the living commune with what came before.''}

\subsection*{Commoner (Peat-cutter with steady barrow and steadier gossip)}
\textit{``The land here remembers everything, especially what you don't say. Skip the ninth step, forget the ninth name, and the green earth takes note. Best keep your omissions honest.''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
The isles of Theona rise green and jagged from the Dolmis, their basalt cliffs wrapped in mists and moorland song. Nominally a duchy sworn to Viterra, in truth the Three Greens heed no crown but their own moots, no law but their taboos. The greatest of these is the silence of Nine: no bell tolls a ninth, no bridge counts that span, no oath dares its syllable. It is said that those who break the ban invite the Green Host, and that debts of nine can never be paid in coin.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Ringfort/Well/Cliff)} Basalt tide-stairs cut into cove; everyone steps past ``missing'' rung; Saint's Well under hawthorn hung with ribbons.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:theona-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (blessings/tokens/rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item The ``No Ninth'' custom: whenever a 9 appears in your seed, add an omission to the scene (a missing step, an unsaid name, an unseen guest). If the 9 is a Diamond, you may break the taboo once---but someone will come to collect later.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{green \& count} motifs---hawthorn that whispers, bells that miscount, promises that take the long way home.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Silent Count:} Players and GMs are encouraged to omit a detail (a name, a step, a tally) when the Ninth appears, echoing Theona's taboo.
\item \textbf{Green Host's Omen:} Any dream-sequence or omen may be framed as ride of Green Host---hoofbeats across sky, wind through moors, sea-spray tasting salt and blood.
\item \textbf{Bride-Peace Feasts:} Weddings, truces, funerals blur; sharing feast can end feud for season---or doom guest if ninth cup poured.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Theona, power flows through ancient custom, sacred spaces, and the careful observance of taboo. The Three Greens maintain their independence through a web of moots, well-keepers, and geas-keepers who ensure the old laws are honored. The King and Matron rule by consensus and tradition, while the unseen Lady Beneath influences events through dreams and whispers.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Theona revolves around blessings, exemptions, and the delicate balance of keeping or breaking taboos. Rewards often take the form of tokens, rights, or divine favor that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (ribbons, tokens, blessings) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival factions issue conflicting exemptions, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the moots, wells, and causeways as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of custom determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Theona, your word is your weave, and your weave determines whether you walk the green path or invite the Host.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{quote}
“In Theona, peace is a ritual, and every word sharpens the blade that seals it.”
\end{quote}

\textbf{In…} A Moot Hill, a Bride-Peacemaker draws a blade between two bloodlines. ``The ninth vow was never spoken,'' she says. ``But the Green Host remembers.''

\paragraph{Anchors at Risk} A grandmother-judge; a field sacred to both sides.
\paragraph{Escalation Beat} Grass stands up against the wind.

\subsection*{Extensions (Plug-in)}
\label{sec:theona-extensions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Silent Count Dial (Orthodoxy \(\leftrightarrow\) Accommodation):} Track how strictly your party keeps Theonan taboos.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Orthodoxy High:} +1 Position when invoking custom (wells, ribbons, eight-count rites); your first attempt to use foreign papers or clocks starts one step worse.
    \item \emph{Accommodation High:} +1 Effect with outsiders (Viterra clerks, foreign captains, notaries); your first sacred-site action each session begins one step worse.
    \item Center the dial by offering restitution (feast for a slighted house, re-tying ribbons at three wells, or sponsoring a Bride-Peace).
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Omen \& Geas (fast procedure):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item When a \textbf{9} appears in any draw/roll, name \emph{what goes uncounted} in the scene (a step, a witness, a tithe).  
    \item Anyone may \emph{break the silence} once/scene: take +1 die \emph{or} treat a Club as a Diamond, then mark \emph{Green Debt} [4]. When \emph{Green Debt} fills, introduce a \emph{Green Host} complication immediately.
    \item Speaking a \emph{Geas} (simple phrasing): on a hit, target gains +1 Effect when honoring it; on a miss, the geas binds a bystander as well.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Causeway Chase (bog, bridge, or cliff path):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Make two clocks: \emph{Reach the Moot} and \emph{Dragged to the Bog} (size by highest rank in your seed).
    \item Pick a lane each exchange: \emph{Stone Teeth} (causeway), \emph{Mire Edge} (bog), \emph{Cliff Track}.  
    \item Advantage: Stone\(\,\triangleright\,\)Mire ( footing), Mire\(\,\triangleright\,\)Cliff ( cover), Cliff\(\,\triangleright\,\)Stone ( vantage).
    \item \emph{Will-Lights (1 SB):} force a lane change or erase the last segment you filled on \emph{Reach the Moot}.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Moot Contest (quick social court):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Lay three stones: \emph{Custom}, \emph{Kin}, \emph{Cost}. Each proof shifts one stone toward you.
    \item Win any two: you secure a \emph{Theona Diamond} (Well-Blessing, Ogham Ruling, or Moot Token).  
    \item \emph{Harp-Satire (2 SB or favor):} flip one stone, but start \emph{Satire Sticks} [4] against you with that house.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Raider Crossroads (optional hooks):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Linn Raid Pressure:} Convert any \textbf{Linn} \emph{Escort Writ} into a one-time \emph{Whale-Escort} here, then roll once on Theona \emph{Clubs}.
    \item \emph{Ashaani/Sidhi Corsairs:} When foreign sails draw near, you may swap one Theona \emph{Spades} for a \emph{Kahfagia} \emph{Spades} draw; treat beacons as \emph{absent} unless a Wick-Warden spends a \emph{Bell-Right}.
    \item \emph{Viterra Claim:} A Viterra official can convert \emph{Ogham Ruling} to \emph{paper} (temporary recognition) but starts \emph{Mainland Return} [4].
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Start-of-Scene Portents (1d6):}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Eight Bells Only:} next taboo-check gains +1 die if you omit a detail in play.
    \item \emph{Green Neighbor Visits:} first bargain with fae courtesy ignores 1 SB.
    \item \emph{Moot on the Wind:} rumor grants +1 die to \emph{Custom} proofs; -1 die to \emph{Cost}.
    \item \emph{Fog Lifts, Swell Rises:} travel faster; stealth worse.
    \item \emph{Song at the Well:} a blessing is on offer; accept and mark \emph{Green Debt} [1].
    \item \emph{Mainland Clerk Ashore:} paper begins one step safer; sacred acts begin one step worse.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Plug-in SB Conversions (Theona flavor):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 1 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Taboo Tangle:} a word refuses to be said; increase DV by 1 unless you mime/custom-workaround.
    \item 2 SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Bog Claims Proof:} a key token/paper is damp, smudged, or lost; switch to \emph{Kin} or \emph{Custom}.
    \item 3+ SB \(\rightarrow\) \emph{Green Hoofbeats:} enforce an immediate lane swap (Causeway) or summon a \emph{Green Neighbors} witness who demands a price.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Reputation Echoes:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Well-Favored:} once/session treat a failed sacred crossing as a \emph{mixed} result; next foreign parley starts worse.
    \item \emph{Moot-Wise:} +1 die on \emph{Custom} proofs; your rivals gain +1 die citing \emph{Cost}.
    \item \emph{Mainland-Touched:} ignore the first \emph{Spoken Geas} penalty in a scene; local taboos scrutinize you (GM may add 1 SB when you boast).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
% ====== THEONA: HIDDEN NINTH & GREEN COURTS (PLUG-IN) ======

\subsection*{The Hidden Ninth (citywide, slow-blooming)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition:} An omission-geas braided through wells, moots, and ringforts. It does not smite; it \emph{rephrases}. Paths add a turn, proofs lose a witness, vows need one word more than you have breath for.
  \item \textbf{Clock:} \emph{Hidden Ninth} [8/10]. Ticks when: a ninth is spoken, a taboo is mocked, or a vow is completed without proper witness. At 4/7/Max the Keeper may promote a \textbf{Clubs} result by one step on causeways, at moots, or near wells.
  \item \textbf{Tells:} Ribbons count “eight-and-one”, cups reset themselves to eight, and hawthorn petals drift in patterns missing a leaf.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Subtle Symptoms (d8, sprinkle lightly)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A ninth footstep never sounds; gravel falls silent mid-stride. 
  \item A guest’s name is remembered by everyone but cannot be \emph{spoken} by anyone. 
  \item A tithe chest always comes up eight coins light—until a \emph{story} is offered. 
  \item A bell rope gains a new, unused knot between the eighth and the tenth. 
  \item A witness raises a ninth finger, then laughs and lowers it without knowing why. 
  \item A bread-loaf splits into eight slices and a heel that no one claims. 
  \item A map shows eight farms; the unmarked ninth casts smoke at dusk. 
  \item Ravens fly in eights; a shadow follows behind them that isn’t a bird.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Cults, Conspiracies, \& Schisms}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Wick Brethren of Eight} (\emph{lamp guild}): enforce the silent count in towers. \emph{Goal:} keep foreign clocks (and taxes) from owning the night. \emph{Method:} “mis-count” fog bells to stall outsiders.
  \item \textbf{Order of the Missing Step} (\emph{cloistered jurists}): archive omissions as law. \emph{Goal:} weaponize \emph{Ninth Law} in moot. \emph{Method:} teach phrase-traps that force rivals to omit themselves.
  \item \textbf{Hawthorn Compact} (\emph{old-faith ring}): dream-courtiers who bargain with the \emph{Lady Beneath}. \emph{Split:}  
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \emph{Greenhands} bind taboos to protect wells.  
      \item \emph{Host-Callers} loosen them to draw the \emph{Green Host} against outsiders.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Saint’s Ninth Bell} (\emph{abbey schism}): the abbot denies the forbidden peal; a reformer claims the saint kept it for \emph{mercy}. \emph{Trial:} ring an unsounded note to save a life—or open a path for the Host.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Ninth Geometry (how it bites at the table)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Omission Tax:} In any \emph{moot, oath, or crossing} scene, each PC must \emph{omit} one detail (name, step, item). If no one omits, tick \emph{Hidden Ninth}. Clever omissions create +1 Position once/scene.
  \item \textbf{Green Debt:} Breaking the taboo grants +1 die \emph{or} lets you treat a \textbf{Clubs} as \textbf{Diamonds} once, then starts \emph{Green Debt} [4]. When it fills, introduce a \emph{Green Host Rides} complication tailored to the oath broken.
  \item \textbf{Well Logic:} Speaking a vow \emph{into water} stores its last word; retrieving it later (ritual, price) lets you rewrite a clause—at the cost of \emph{Green Favor} owed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Green Courts (fae procedure, fast)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lay three counters: \emph{Courtesy}, \emph{Memory}, \emph{Price}.  
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Courtesy:} bows, phrasing, gifts of bread/salt/hawthorn.  
      \item \textbf{Memory:} recite lineage, cite local taboo without erring.  
      \item \textbf{Price:} offer \emph{a non-coin payment} (a dawn’s silence, a winter’s story, a true omission).
    \end{itemize}
  \item Win two counters: the Court grants a \emph{Green Favor} (treat one \textbf{Clubs} as \textbf{Hearts} this scene) or an \emph{Unnumbered Right}. Lose two: a fae witness claims a breath, a shadow, or a seat at your next feast.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Ritual Counters (anyone can attempt, 1/scene)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Eight-Plait Ribbon:} weave at Saint’s Well; cancel the first \emph{Spoken Geas} penalty this scene. 
  \item \textbf{Kelp-Knot Promise:} tie on a tide-stair; downgrade one \textbf{Clubs} on a crossing to \emph{Minor}. 
  \item \textbf{Bog-Bread Share:} break one loaf into eight; the ninth heel tossed to the fen grants +1 die to sway \emph{Green Neighbors}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Boss Seeds (three-phase, Theona style)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Unsung Bell} (\emph{forbidden note given will}): \emph{Phases} — Hum in Mist $\rightarrow$ Echo Under Well-stone $\rightarrow$ Command of Fog. \emph{Cracks} — bind its clapper with eight ribbons; let a rival speak the ninth and pay; drown the echo at Sea-Cave Harp.
  \item \textbf{Bride-Thief of the Green Host} (\emph{dream raider}): \emph{Phases} — Invitation in Sleep $\rightarrow$ Procession Across Moor $\rightarrow$ Feast Without Ninth Cup. \emph{Cracks} — cut the dream-veil with silver; sing satire at the \emph{Green Moot Hill}; trade a \emph{Bride-Charter}.
  \item \textbf{The Missing Step} (\emph{living omission}): \emph{Phases} — Vanished Witness $\rightarrow$ Unread Clause $\rightarrow$ Unwalkable Bridge. \emph{Cracks} — invite a Taboo-Witness to count aloud; spill nine drops into Saint’s Well but \emph{name only eight}; let the \emph{Lady Beneath} keep a memory.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Scenario Starters (plug-and-play)}
\paragraph{Nine Cups Poured}
\emph{Hook:} A peace-feast accidentally pours the ninth cup; knives hum.  
\emph{Truth:} Order of the Missing Step staged it to void a \emph{Bride-Charter}.  
\emph{Relief:} Re-pour with bog-water and satire (cool \emph{Blood Feud}); or let the \emph{Green Courts} witness and accept \emph{Green Debt} for one season of truce.

\paragraph{The Mainland’s Ninth}
\emph{Hook:} Viterra surveyors install nine benchmarks; fog eats the map.  
\emph{Truth:} Wick Brethren mis-counted bells to protect wells; now routes loop.  
\emph{Relief:} Trade an \emph{Ogham Ruling} for a paper map in eights; or escort the surveyors to rename the benchmarks at \emph{Lookout Cliff} (start \emph{Mainland Return}).

\paragraph{A Well Without a Word}
\emph{Hook:} Saint’s Well refuses every wish; ribbons mildew.  
\emph{Truth:} A vow’s last word was stolen by a \emph{Green Neighbor} as price.  
\emph{Relief:} Pay with \emph{silence at dawn} on \emph{Black Bog Causeway}; or ring an off-note at \emph{Fog-Wick Tower} (risks \emph{Ninth Law} entering play).

\subsection*{Cross-Region Threads}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mistlands Bells:} If the \emph{Ninth Peal} is active there, any Theona scene near bells starts with \emph{Hidden Ninth} +1 and allows one \emph{Bell-Right} to negate a \emph{Ground-Mist}. 
  \item \textbf{Linn Raids:} Converting a \emph{Linn Escort Writ} to \emph{Whale-Escort} here cools \emph{Green Host Rises} by 1 but advances \emph{Bride-Theft}. 
  \item \textbf{Kahfagia Lights:} A \emph{Mirror Warrant} can “post” a courtesy beacon off Theona; while lit, treat \emph{Great Fog} once as \emph{Ground-Mist}, then tick \emph{Ninth Law}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Start-of-Scene Omens (1d6, Theona tint)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Eight Echoes:} any shouted word returns eightfold; +1 die to ritual phrasing. 
  \item \emph{Green Ribbon Wet:} wells generous; first \emph{Diamonds} gains +1 potency. 
  \item \emph{Heel for the Fen:} a free \emph{Bog-Bread Share} is on offer; refuse and tick \emph{Hidden Ninth}. 
  \item \emph{Bride’s Knife Glints:} first social scene can stake \emph{peace by marriage} (on a miss, start \emph{Bride-Theft}). 
  \item \emph{Wick Sputters:} fog-lamps falter; first \emph{Bell-Right} costs a \emph{favor} or \emph{Green Debt} [1]. 
  \item \emph{Hawthorn Dreams:} a PC wakes with an omitted memory—and a usable \emph{Unnumbered Right} this scene.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Plug-in SB Conversions (Ninth flavor)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Any 1 SB $\rightarrow$ \emph{Skipped Step}: reposition everyone one “count” off (causeway lane swaps; a proof misses its turn). 
  \item Any 2 SB $\rightarrow$ \emph{Unspeaking}: a key noun cannot be uttered this scene; use symbol, music, or gift instead. 
  \item 3+ SB $\rightarrow$ \emph{Host’s Glance}: halve a consequence by inviting a \emph{Green Neighbor} to witness; begin a \emph{Green Favor} call-in clock [4].
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Reputation Echoes (who you are to the Greens)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Well-Kept:} once/session treat a failed well crossing as mixed; foreign paper starts one step colder. 
  \item \emph{Host-Gentled:} your first fae bargain ignores 1 SB; mortal rivals gain +1 die citing \emph{Cost}. 
  \item \emph{Eighth-Counter:} you and your crew may declare “eight-and-one” to cancel the first \emph{Hidden Ninth} tick in a public rite; start \emph{Taboo-Watcher} [4] on you.
\end{itemize}
