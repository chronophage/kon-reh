\section{Theona --- ``Three Greens, No Ninth''}
\label{chap:theona}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Theme \& Atmosphere}]
The isles of Theona rise green and jagged from the Dolmis, their basalt cliffs wrapped in mists and moorland song. Nominally a duchy sworn to Viterra, in truth the Three Greens heed no crown but their own moots, no law but their taboos. The greatest of these is the silence of Nine: no bell tolls a ninth, no bridge counts that span, no oath dares its syllable. It is said that those who break the ban invite the Green Host, and that debts of nine can never be paid in coin.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{(Ringfort/Well/Cliff)} Basalt tide-stairs cut into cove; everyone steps past ``missing'' rung; Saint's Well under hawthorn hung with ribbons.

\section*{Quick use notes}
\label{sec:theona-quick-use}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2--5 $\rightarrow$ 4, 6--10 $\rightarrow$ 6, J/Q/K $\rightarrow$ 8, A $\rightarrow$ 10).
\item Diamonds are codified outcomes (blessings/tokens/rights) that change position rather than call for a roll.
\item The ``No Ninth'' custom: whenever a 9 appears in your seed, add an omission to the scene (a missing step, an unsaid name, an unseen guest). If the 9 is a Diamond, you may break the taboo once---but someone will come to collect later.
\item If any A appears, echo \textbf{green \& count} motifs---hawthorn that whispers, bells that miscount, promises that take the long way home.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Silent Count:} Players and GMs are encouraged to omit a detail (a name, a step, a tally) when the Ninth appears, echoing Theona's taboo.
\item \textbf{Green Host's Omen:} Any dream-sequence or omen may be framed as ride of Green Host---hoofbeats across sky, wind through moors, sea-spray tasting salt and blood.
\item \textbf{Bride-Peace Feasts:} Weddings, truces, funerals blur; sharing feast can end feud for season---or doom guest if ninth cup poured.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Patronage \& Power}]
In Theona, power flows through ancient custom, sacred spaces, and the careful observance of taboo. The Three Greens maintain their independence through a web of moots, well-keepers, and geas-keepers who ensure the old laws are honored. The King and Matron rule by consensus and tradition, while the unseen Lady Beneath influences events through dreams and whispers.

\textbf{For the GM:}  
Patronage in Theona revolves around blessings, exemptions, and the delicate balance of keeping or breaking taboos. Rewards often take the form of tokens, rights, or divine favor that can be leveraged into greater influence. To emphasize this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tie rewards to visible symbols (ribbons, tokens, blessings) that can be challenged, stolen, or voided.
\item Let rival factions issue conflicting exemptions, forcing players to choose whose favor matters more.
\item Use the moots, wells, and causeways as arenas for social contests, where knowledge of custom determines success.
\end{itemize}
In Theona, your word is your weave, and your weave determines whether you walk the green path or invite the Host.
