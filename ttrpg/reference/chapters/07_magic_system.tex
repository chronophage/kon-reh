\chapter{Magic System}

\section{Design Philosophy}\index{Magic!Design Philosophy}

Magic in Fate's Edge is not a tool of convenience but a dangerous negotiation with the fabric of reality. It is powerful, flexible, and transformative---yet every attempt to shape it carries risk. The dice never merely ask "does it work?" but always whisper "what is the cost?"

\section{The Nature of Magic}\index{Magic!Nature}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Volatile by Design}: Magic is not fully understood, even by its most adept practitioners. Every working pushes against boundaries that resist being bent.\index{Magic!Volatility}
\item \textbf{Risk Embodied}: Each spell generates Complication Points. These points do not vanish; they manifest as Backlash, unpredictable consequences that ripple outward.\index{Magic!Risk}
\item \textbf{Narrative Weight}: Casting is always a story moment. Even a "successful" spell alters the scene in ways the caster did not intend.\index{Magic!Narrative Weight}
\item \textbf{Thematic Consequence}: Backlash is not arbitrary; it aligns with the opposing or uncontrolled element of the Art invoked (flame flares out of control, shadows linger too long, storms roll beyond command).\index{Magic!Thematic Consequence}
\end{itemize}

\section{The Eight Elements of Magic}\index{Magic!Elements}

The fundamental metaphysical system that underlies all magical practice in Fate's Edge divides magic into eight distinct elements, each with its own nature and resonance.

\section{The Caster's Burden}\index{Magic!Caster's Burden}

Magicians are defined not by what they can do, but by what they are willing to risk. A cautious spellcaster describes carefully, invests in detailed actions, and may survive long. A reckless one courts power at great personal and narrative cost. Both choices shape the story.

\section{Casting Procedure}\index{Magic!Casting Procedure}

All spellcasting follows a structured sequence called the Casting Loop. It unfolds across two phases of play: gathering strength, then weaving it into form.

\subsection{Channel}\index{Magic!Channel}
The caster focuses, rolling Wits + Arcana to gather Potential. Each success becomes fuel for shaping the spell. Each 1 adds Complication Points immediately.

\subsection{Weave}\index{Magic!Weave}
On the following turn, the caster rolls Wits + (Art) to shape Potential into a defined effect. The Description Ladder applies: Basic/Detailed/Intricate descriptions reduce or redirect Complication Points.

\subsection{Backlash}\index{Magic!Backlash}
Complication Points spent by the GM manifest as uncontrolled consequences. These are thematic to the Art and scale with the number of points spent: minor nuisances at low levels, dangerous disasters at high levels.

\textbf{Mitigation}: Boons do not reduce CP unless a Talent/Asset explicitly says "Mitigate CP."

\section{Backlash Severity Table}\index{Magic!Backlash Severity}

\begin{description}
\item[1--2 CP] Minor nuisance or tell; short-lived cost, noise, or reveal.\index{Magic!Backlash!Minor}
\item[3--4 CP] Noticeable setback: a real hazard, condition, or new pressure clock.\index{Magic!Backlash!Moderate}
\item[5+ CP] Major turn: scene shifts, a new foe/clock enters, or severe condition.\index{Magic!Backlash!Major}
\end{description}

\section{Global Guardrails}\index{Magic!Global Guardrails}

\begin{itemize}
\item Duration defaults: buffs 3 beats; areas 1 beat. Sustaining costs 1 Fatigue/beat.\index{Magic!Duration}
\item Stacking: same-Art buffs do not stack; take the best one.\index{Magic!Stacking}
\item Diamond line: spells cannot create Diamonds; only position/effect/rails/clock movement.\index{Magic!Diamond Line}
\item Over-Stack: any standing spell advantage counts toward Over-Stack when the party enters a scene with multiple structural edges.\index{Magic!Over-Stack}
\end{itemize}

\section{Ritual Casting (Optional Rule)}\index{Magic!Ritual Casting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ritual Helper Cap}: You may draw on ceil(Arcana/2) helpers (max 3).\index{Magic!Ritual!Helpers}
    \item \textbf{Procedure}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Declare the Ritual.\index{Magic!Ritual!Declare}
        \item Channel Together.\index{Magic!Ritual!Channel}
        \item Weave.\index{Magic!Ritual!Weave}
        \item Backlash.\index{Magic!Ritual!Backlash}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Relevant skills}: Helpers may use different relevant skills if their procedure is fictionally distinct.\index{Magic!Ritual!Skills}
    \item \textbf{CP distribution}: CP from Channel resolves on that roller. CP from Weave is assigned to the primary caster.\index{Magic!Ritual!CP Distribution}
\end{itemize}

\section{High Elf Magical Philosophy}\index{Magic!High Elf Philosophy}

High Elves approach magic as conscious, responsible catastrophe management. Their philosophy is built on three core principles:

\subsection{The Law of Narrative Substance (The Echo)}\index{Magic!High Elf Philosophy!Echo}
Everything possesses a metaphysical narrative—a story that defines its nature and purpose. Magic works by interacting with these narratives rather than simply manipulating physical properties.

\subsection{The Law of Artful Manifestation (The Art)}\index{Magic!High Elf Philosophy!Art}
Magic requires not just power, but artistry. The caster must craft their intention with precision, understanding both the desired outcome and the story they are trying to tell.

\subsection{The Law of Narrative Recoil (The Backlash)}\index{Magic!High Elf Philosophy!Backlash}
Magic does not solve problems—it changes them. Every spell creates new complications by altering the narrative fabric of reality. Wise casters prepare for these shifts.

\section{Cultural Magical Traditions}\index{Magic!Cultural Traditions}

\subsection{High Elf Magic}\index{High Elves!Magic}
High Elves practice magic as conscious catastrophe management, focusing on long-term consequences and narrative resonance. Their spells often have subtle effects but profound implications.

\subsection{Wood Elf Magic}\index{Wood Elves!Magic}
Wood Elves specialize in low-signature, ecological magic that works in harmony with nature. Their spells include growth nudges, spoor-hiding, and sense-bending fogs.

\subsection{Dwarven Magic}\index{Dwarves!Magic}
Dwarves focus on geomancy and stone-working, creating wards and structural enhancements. Their magic is practical and enduring.

\subsection{Gnome Magic}\index{Gnomes!Magic}
Gnomes practice low-glamour, high-precision magic including ward-etching and probability slighting. Their spells are precise but often have unexpected side effects.

\section{Spell List}\index{Magic!Spells}
