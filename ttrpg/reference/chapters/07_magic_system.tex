\chapter{Magic System}

\section{Design Philosophy}

Magic in Fate's Edge is not a tool of convenience but a dangerous negotiation with the fabric of reality. It is powerful, flexible, and transformative---yet every attempt to shape it carries risk. The dice never merely ask "does it work?" but always whisper "what is the cost?"

\section{The Nature of Magic}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Volatile by Design}: Magic is not fully understood, even by its most adept practitioners. Every working pushes against boundaries that resist being bent.
\item \textbf{Risk Embodied}: Each spell generates Complication Points. These points do not vanish; they manifest as Backlash, unpredictable consequences that ripple outward.
\item \textbf{Narrative Weight}: Casting is always a story moment. Even a "successful" spell alters the scene in ways the caster did not intend.
\item \textbf{Thematic Consequence}: Backlash is not arbitrary; it aligns with the opposing or uncontrolled element of the Art invoked (flame flares out of control, shadows linger too long, storms roll beyond command).
\end{itemize}

\section{The Caster's Burden}

Magicians are defined not by what they can do, but by what they are willing to risk. A cautious spellcaster describes carefully, invests in detailed actions, and may survive long. A reckless one courts power at great personal and narrative cost. Both choices shape the story.

\section{Casting Procedure}

All spellcasting follows a structured sequence called the Casting Loop. It unfolds across two phases of play: gathering strength, then weaving it into form.

\subsection{Channel}
The caster focuses, rolling Wits + Arcana to gather Potential. Each success becomes fuel for shaping the spell. Each 1 adds Complication Points immediately.

\subsection{Weave}
On the following turn, the caster rolls Wits + (Art) to shape Potential into a defined effect. The Description Ladder applies: Basic/Detailed/Intricate descriptions reduce or redirect Complication Points.

\subsection{Backlash}
Complication Points spent by the GM manifest as uncontrolled consequences. These are thematic to the Art and scale with the number of points spent: minor nuisances at low levels, dangerous disasters at high levels.

\textbf{Mitigation}: Boons do not reduce CP unless a Talent/Asset explicitly says "Mitigate CP."

\section{Backlash Severity Table}

\begin{description}
\item[1--2 CP] Minor nuisance or tell; short-lived cost, noise, or reveal.
\item[3--4 CP] Noticeable setback: a real hazard, condition, or new pressure clock.
\item[5+ CP] Major turn: scene shifts, a new foe/clock enters, or severe condition.
\end{description}

\section{Global Guardrails}

\begin{itemize}
\item Duration defaults: buffs 3 beats; areas 1 beat. Sustaining costs 1 Fatigue/beat.
\item Stacking: same-Art buffs do not stack; take the best one.
\item Diamond line: spells cannot create Diamonds; only position/effect/rails/clock movement.
\item Over-Stack: any standing spell advantage counts toward Over-Stack when the crew enters a scene with multiple structural edges.
\end{itemize}

\section{Ritual Casting (Optional Rule)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ritual Helper Cap}: You may draw on ceil(Arcana/2) helpers (max 3).
    \item \textbf{Procedure}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Declare the Ritual.
        \item Channel Together.
        \item Weave.
        \item Backlash.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Relevant skills}: Helpers may use different relevant skills if their procedure is fictionally distinct.
    \item \textbf{CP distribution}: CP from Channel resolves on that roller. CP from Weave is assigned to the primary caster.
\end{itemize}

\section{Spell List}

\subsection{Cinder-Fist (Pyromancy, DV 2)}
Effect: Your hand ignites; for up to 3 beats, unarmed actions gain +1 effect. On a strong hit vs flammables, you may Hazard --1 once. Requires a free hand; Obvious.

Backlash: 1 CP flame gutters after one use; 2 CP caster takes Fatigue 1 and scorches sleeve; 3 CP unintended item ignites (start a small Hazard clock); 4+ CP fire wreathes arm (Harm 2) and draws attention.

\subsection{Stone-Sense (Geomancy, DV 1)}
Effect: Sense through contiguous stone (30 ft); learn flaws/layout. Grant Controlled to a single move/breach using this read.

Backlash: 1 CP echo of ancient pain (distraction); 2 CP muddled by a competing presence; 3 CP partial petrification (--1 die physical for the next scene); 4+ CP something attuned in the stone is alerted to you.

\subsection{Still the Currents (Hydromancy, DV 2)}
Effect: Calm a 10 ft water square for 1 beat. Either start Controlled for one crossing or Hazard --1 in that zone. Sustaining costs 1 Fatigue/beat.

Backlash: 1 CP water becomes too mirror-flat (stealth tell); 2 CP chop intensifies outside the zone; 3 CP area stays eerily still until disturbed (curiosity magnet); 4+ CP water turns foul/stagnant, inviting pests.

\subsection{Cloak of Shadows (Umbramancy, DV 2)}
Effect: In dim or darker light, target starts Controlled vs sight-based detection; bright light ends the effect. Does not help vs sound/scent.

Backlash: 1 CP slight self-blindness (--1 die sight checks); 2 CP whispering shadows create a faint tell; 3 CP you borrow light from elsewhere, leaving a conspicuously bright patch; 4+ CP a shadow-being takes interest.

\subsection{Storm's Edge (Stormcraft, DV 3)}
Effect: For this scene, your ranged attacks gain +1 effect and may push targets back 1 zone. Requires open air; Obvious.

Backlash: 1 CP wind snatches small items; 2 CP lightning grounds nearby (Hazard +1); 3 CP gale forces repositioning (lose next action); 4+ CP storm lingers beyond control (start Weather(6) clock).

\subsection{Mend Flesh (Vitalism, DV 3)}
Effect: Choose one: clear 2 Fatigue or step down 1 Injury level (max to Moderate). Requires stillness (no sprint/fight beat).

Backlash: 1 CP patient must rest soon or gain Fatigue 1; 2 CP neglected minor injury festers; 3 CP clumsy overgrowth (--1 die related physical until treated); 4+ CP life drawn from surroundings (plants wither, small life dies).

\section{Spell Creation Guidance}

\subsection{DV Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
\item DV 1 = subtle sense or tiny edge
\item DV 2 = scene-shaping buff/patch in a small area
\item DV 3 = potent, loud, or multi-target edge
\item Ace-level miracles should demand a price (Fatigue/Harm, costly component, or Obvious in a hostile place)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Writing Spells}
Write the spell in 3 lines:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Name \& Art: pick an evocative verb+noun (Cinder-Fist, Stone-Sense)
\item Effect: one clear board change: start Controlled, +1 effect, Hazard --1, Hunt --1, or grant a one-shot capability
\item Backlash ladder: 1--2 CP = tell/minor cost; 3--4 CP = new pressure (rail tick, condition, hazard clock); 5+ CP = scene-altering twist
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Common Outcome Verbs}
Choose one: Start Controlled • +1 effect • Reduce (Rail) by --1 • Advance (Primary/side) by +1 • Grant 1-beat access • Silence/Obscure one sense.

\section{Deck-Based Spell Seed Generator}

When improvising, draw 2--3 cards. Use the suit to pick an Art, rank to set DV and a scope tweak. Face cards add a quirk; Aces add a price.

\subsection{Suit Arts}
\begin{description}
\item[\textcolor{red}{$\heartsuit$}] Vitalism / Hydromancy: life, vigor, calm, flow, restoration
\item[\textcolor{black}{$\clubsuit$}] Geomancy / Discipline: stone, structure, weight, binding
\item[\textcolor{red}{$\diamondsuit$}] Pyromancy / Transformation: heat, light, change, urgency
\item[\textcolor{black}{$\spadesuit$}] Umbramancy / Veil: shadow, silence, misdirection, fear
\end{description}

\subsection{Rank $\rightarrow$ DV \& Scope}
\begin{itemize}
\item 2--4: DV 1 (self or tiny area; 1 target; 1 beat sense/edge)
\item 5--9: DV 2 (small zone $\sim$10 ft; team-sized buff; 1 rail tick)
\item 10, J, Q, K: DV 3 (loud, group-facing, or multi-rail influence)
\item Ace: DV 3 + price (component, Fatigue 1, Harm 1, or an Obvious flare)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Face-card Quirks}
\begin{description}
\item[J] Brief mobility or reach boost (leap, glide, slip)
\item[Q] Social resonance (hush, awe, dread)
\item[K] Durability/impact bump (+1 effect on one hard task)
\end{description}

\subsection{Backlash Prompts by Suit}
\begin{description}
\item[\textcolor{red}{$\heartsuit$} (Vitalism/Water)] overgrowth, exhaustion, stagnation, sympathetic drain
\item[\textcolor{black}{$\clubsuit$} (Stone/Discipline)] rigidity, slow, echoing calls, guardians notice
\item[\textcolor{red}{$\diamondsuit$} (Fire/Change)] flare, scorch, noise, uncontrolled spread
\item[\textcolor{black}{$\spadesuit$} (Shadow/Veil)] whispers, self-blindness, cold spots, entities take interest
\end{description}

\subsection{Generated Example}
Drawn: $\diamondsuit$ 10, $\spadesuit$ J

Name: Ember-Stride (Pyromancy). DV: 3.

Effect: For 1 beat, you dash through a chokepoint with start Controlled and +1 effect on clears; leaves a hot shimmer that Hazard --1 as pursuers hesitate. Obvious.

Backlash: 1--2 CP singe/heat-haze reveals route; 3--4 CP smolder opens a Fire(4) clock; 5+ CP flare alarms watchers (start Crowd +1 and Hunt +1).
