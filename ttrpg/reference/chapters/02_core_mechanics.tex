\section{Core Mechanic: The Art of Consequence}

All significant actions follow a three-step process:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Approach} --- The player describes both what their character wants and how they attempt it. This defines the primary Skill and clarifies the fiction.
\item \textbf{Execution} --- Build a dice pool equal to Attribute + Skill and roll that many \dice{10}s. Each die of 6 or higher counts as a success. Each 1 rolled generates a Complication Point.
\item \textbf{Outcome} --- The GM interprets total successes against the difficulty of the task. Complication Points are then spent to weave narrative setbacks, collateral costs, or escalating danger.
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Description Ladder}

The quality of the player's description affects the resilience of their roll against complication:

\begin{description}
\item[Basic Action] Roll the pool as-is. All 1s remain as Complication Points.
\item[Detailed Action] A clear, descriptive flourish allows the player to re-roll one die showing 1.
\item[Intricate Action] A richly described, multi-sensory action allows the player to re-roll all dice showing 1, and add one positive narrative flourish to the scene if they succeed.
\end{description}

\section{Difficulty Ladder}

\begin{tabular}{cll}
\toprule
\textbf{DV} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{When to Use} \\
\midrule
1 & Routine & Clear intent, modest stakes, controlled environment \\
2 & Pressured & Time pressure, mild resistance, partial information \\
3 & Hard & Hostile conditions, active opposition, precise timing \\
4+ & Extreme & Multiple constraints, high precision or secrecy \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\section{Outcome Matrix}

Let $S$ be successes ($\geq 6$) and $C$ be Complication Points (number of 1s rolled).

\begin{description}
\item[Clean Success] ($S \geq DV$ and $C = 0$) --- Deliver the intent crisply. Offer a small positional or information edge if description was Intricate.
\item[Success \& Cost] ($S \geq DV$ and $C > 0$) --- Grant the intent; spend/bank CP to add friction (noise, time lost, resource wear, new eyes on the scene).
\item[Partial] ($0 < S < DV$) --- Progress with a fork: Get it but... (time/position/gear cost) or Leave it and... (take safety, new intel).
\item[Miss] ($S = 0$) --- No progress. Cash some CP now or bank for a coming beat. Consider offering a Devil's Bargain: succeed at $DV-1$ if you accept a named complication.
\end{description}
