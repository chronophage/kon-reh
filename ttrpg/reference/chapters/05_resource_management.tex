\chapter{Resource Management}

\section{Supply Clock}

The Supply Clock is a shared condition for the entire party, representing food, water, and basic gear.

\subsection{States}

\begin{description}
\item[Full Supply (0 filled)] The party is well-equipped. No penalties.
\item[Low Supply (2 filled)] Minor narrative complications: bland food, damaged arrows, thinning waterskins.
\item[Dangerously Low (3 filled)] Each character gains Fatigue.
\item[Out of Supply (4 filled)] Severe penalties; starvation, dehydration, failing gear.
\end{description}

\subsection{Filling the Clock}

\begin{itemize}
\item Harsh travel or lost pack animals (GM fiat)
\item GM spends 2+ Complication Points
\item The party chooses to travel light for advantage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Emptying the Clock}

\begin{itemize}
\item Reaching civilization resets to Full
\item Foraging/hunting: group Survival check clears 1 segment
\item Downtime in safety removes 1 segment
\end{itemize}

\section{Fatigue}

Fatigue represents exhaustion, hunger, and strain.

\subsection{Effects}

\begin{description}
\item[1 Fatigue] Minor drain. On your next roll, re-roll one success (player's choice).
\item[2 Fatigue] Worn down. On each roll, re-roll one success.
\item[3 Fatigue] Failing fast. On each roll, re-roll two successes.
\item[4 Fatigue] Collapse/KO/Spiritual break. You fall out of the scene until treated or rescued.
\end{description}

\subsection{Recovery}

A night's rest with adequate Supply removes 1 level. You cannot clear Fatigue if the party's Supply clock is Dangerously Low or Empty.

\section{Gear Condition}

Gear does not have hit points. It suffers only when drama demands it.

\subsection{Compromised Items}

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduced via Complication Points or narrative consequence
\item A Compromised item gives --1 die on relevant rolls
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Breaking Point}

If a Compromised item suffers another setback, it breaks entirely.

\subsection{Repair}

\begin{description}
\item[Field Repair] Temporary; Craft or Survival check removes penalty for one scene
\item[Proper Repair] Permanent; requires tools, materials, and downtime
\end{description}

\section{Asset and Follower Management}

\subsection{Followers (On-Screen)}

\begin{description}
\item[Cost] Cap$^2$ XP
\item[Assist] +Cap dice (in-role) or +1 (off-role, intricate)
\item[Cap] 1-5 (5 is exceptional)
\item[Upkeep] Coin equal to Cap or scene tending; miss 2 = Unreliable
\end{description}

\subsection{Off-Screen Assets}

\begin{description}
\item[Minor (4 XP)] Safehouse, small charter
\item[Standard (8 XP)] Noble title, guild section, spy ring
\item[Major (12 XP)] City license, regional network
\item[Activation] 1 Boon or 2 XP per distinct outcome
\end{description}

\subsection{Condition Tracks}

\begin{description}
\item[Maintained] Full capability; no penalties
\item[Neglected] --1 die when used (assist or leverage). Narratively: slower, sullen, short-staffed
\item[Compromised] Unavailable. Narratively: captured, burned, seized, defected
\end{description}

\subsection{Maintenance and Repair}

\begin{itemize}
\item After a story arc or 2--3 sessions of heavy use, the GM may flag the resource as at risk
\item To keep it Maintained, the player must either:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Spend downtime repairing/servicing it, or
  \item Pay XP immediately (representing replacement parts, masterwork upkeep)
  \item If neglected, the gear becomes Compromised (--1 die penalty) and may eventually break
  \item Superior and Artifact gear do not require upkeep, but if Compromised through Complications, only narrative quests can repair them
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
