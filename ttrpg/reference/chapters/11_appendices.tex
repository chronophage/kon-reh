\section{Quick Reference Sheets}

\subsection{Core Mechanic: The Art of Consequence}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Approach}: Player states intent and method (Attribute + Skill).
\item \textbf{Execution}: Roll dice pool of \dice{10}s. Each 6+ is a success; each 1 is a Complication Point.
\item \textbf{Outcome}: Basic Roll as-is; Detailed re-roll one 1; Intricate re-roll all 1s and add one positive flourish if successful.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Attributes and Skills}

\begin{description}
\item[Body] Strength, endurance, physical force.
\item[Wits] Perception, cleverness, reflexes.
\item[Spirit] Willpower, intuition, resilience.
\item[Presence] Charm, command, social force.
\end{description}

\subsection{Skill Ratings (0--5)}

\begin{description}
\item[0 Untrained] Rely on raw Attribute.
\item[1 Familiar] Basic competence.
\item[2 Skilled] Reliable training.
\item[3 Expert] Professional mastery.
\item[4 Master] Renowned in your field.
\item[5 Legendary] Near-mythic talent.
\end{description}

\subsection{XP Costs}

\begin{description}
\item[Attributes] New rating $\times$ 3.
\item[Skills] New level $\times$ 2.
\item[Followers (On-Screen)] Cap$^2$ XP.
\item[Off-Screen Assets] Minor 4 XP, Standard 8 XP, Major 12 XP.
\end{description}

\section{Deck of Consequences}

Fate's Edge uses two distinct card tools:

\paragraph{Travel Decks (regional, 52-card).}
\emph{Spade}=Place, \emph{Heart}=Actor, \emph{Club}=Pressure, \emph{Diamond}=Leverage. These power journeys and gates.

\paragraph{Deck of Consequences (scene drama).}
\emph{Hearts}=social fallout, \emph{Spades}=harm/escalation, \emph{Clubs}=material cost, \emph{Diamonds}=magical/spiritual disturbance.

\textit{Guidance:} Never mix suit meanings across decks. When a rule references ``Spade/Club/Diamond,'' it means \emph{Travel}. When it says ``Hearts/Spades/Clubs/Diamonds,'' it means \emph{Consequences}.

\subsection{Using the Deck}

After a roll that generates CP, the GM chooses one method for that roll:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Direct Spend}: Translate CP into consequences/rail ticks immediately.
  \item \textbf{Deck Draw}: Draw up to \textbf{min(CP, 3)} cards and synthesize a single twist guided by suit and highest rank.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Consequences Deck Structure}

\begin{description}
\item[Hearts] Emotional / Social fallout (fear, anger, betrayal)
\item[Spades] Physical harm / Obstacles (injuries, blockades, fatigue)
\item[Clubs] Resource / Wealth loss (gear breaks, expenses rise)
\item[Diamonds] Mystical / Narrative twists (omens, curses, chance)
\end{description}

\subsection{Ranks (1--10, J--K--A)}

\begin{description}
\item[Ace--3] Minor inconvenience or flavor complication.
\item[4--6] Moderate setback with some narrative teeth.
\item[7--9] Significant consequence altering the course of action.
\item[10--King] Major fallout, introducing new problems or lasting scars.
\end{description}

\section{Magic Casting Loop}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Channel}: Wits + Arcana roll to gather Potential.
\item \textbf{Weave}: Wits + Art roll to shape spell.
\item \textbf{Backlash}: Complication Points spent through Deck of Consequences, themed to the opposing element.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Mitigation}: Boons do not reduce CP unless a Talent/Asset explicitly says "Mitigate CP."

\section{Player Archetypes}

\begin{description}
\item[Solo] Invests in Attributes + Skills. Strong spotlight.
\item[Mixed] Balances self with one follower or off-screen assets.
\item[Mastermind] Multiple followers + networks, but more narrative liabilities.
\end{description}

\section{Narrative Time}

\begin{description}
\item[A Moment] A heartbeat; single action.
\item[Some Time] A few minutes; quick exchanges.
\item[Significant Time] An hour or more; downtime actions.
\item[Days] Extended travel or projects.
\end{description}

\section{GM Guidance at a Glance}

\begin{itemize}
\item Spend Complication Points to add story problems, not punish.
\item Always tie consequences back to thematic domains (Hearts, Spades, Clubs, Diamonds).
\item Encourage Intricate actions: reward description with rerolls and narrative control.
\item Let Off-Screen assets resolve downtime problems but keep adventures on the table.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Guardrails (So It Feels Fair)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Telegraph clocks. Name them aloud or show them in fiction.
\item Spend CP transparently. "I'm using 2 CP to tick Patrol Sweep."
\item Always offer a way out. Boon, asset burn, or devil's bargain.
\item Let Fatigue bite. It's your attrition dial; don't be shy.
\end{itemize}

\section{Mechanical Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ASSIST MAX}: +3 dice total per roll, regardless of helpers. Exception: The "Exceptional Coordination" Talent allows one follower to provide +4 assist dice.
    \item \textbf{BOON MAX}: 5 total, 2→1 XP conversion once/session (max 2 XP via conversion per session).
    \item \textbf{INITIATIVE}: 1 Follower Action per scene crew-wide.
    \item \textbf{OVER-STACK}: 2+ structural advantages = start rails +1 OR GM banks +1 CP.
    \item \textbf{POSITION}: Controlled | Risky | Desperate (affects success/failure texture).
\end{itemize}

\section{Clock Starters (d6 Prompts)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Peril (6): "They triangulate your hideout." Triggers: noise, bribed neighbor, CP spend.
\item Supply (4): "The cold eats your prep." Triggers: storm, lost mule, CP spend.
\item Doom (8): "Blood moon eats the sky." Triggers: daily tick, ritual step, CP spend.
\item Debt (6): "Collector circles." Triggers: downtime passes, flash spend, CP spend.
\item Injury (4): "Cracking ice underfoot." Triggers: sprint, fall, CP spend.
\item Hunt (6): "Rival fixer stalks your routes." Triggers: contact flips, trace, CP spend.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sample Play (Clocks + CP + Fatigue)}

\subsection{Scene Frame}
Smuggling a witness over the palace wall at night. Active clocks: Patrol Sweep (6) at 3/6, Supply (4) at 1/4.

\subsection{Beats}

\textbf{1) Scout the south wall} Wits+Stealth (5\dice{10}): 10, 8, 6, 3, 1 $\Rightarrow$ 3 hits, 1 CP. GM spends 1 CP: "You succeed, but your old rope is Compromised." Patrol Sweep stays at 3/6.

\textbf{2) Climb with the witness} Body+Athletics (4\dice{10}): 7, 6, 5, 1 $\Rightarrow$ 2 hits, 1 CP. GM spends 1 CP to tick Patrol Sweep $\Rightarrow$ 4/6 and adds pressure: "Lanterns brighten; bootsteps quicken along the inner walk."

\textbf{3) Last push, running low} GM fills Supply to 2/4 due to Significant Time climbing and cold. Face tries to soothe the witness (Presence+Sway, 5\dice{10}): 9, 8, 2, 1, 1 $\Rightarrow$ 2 hits, 2 CP. GM spends 2 CP: +1 Fatigue to the Face (shivering, breathless) and tick Patrol Sweep to 5/6.

\textbf{4) Extraction or collapse} They have a choice: burn a Boon to activate an off-screen contact's garden gate, or risk one more roll with Fatigue penalties. If they roll and give the GM 1 CP, the GM can fill Patrol Sweep to 6/6 $\Rightarrow$ "Cordon slams shut; horns blare. Capture is on the table."
