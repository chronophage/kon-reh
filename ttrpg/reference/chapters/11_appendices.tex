\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Approach}: Player states intent and method (Attribute + Skill).
\item \textbf{Execution}: Roll dice pool of \dice{10}s. Each 6+ is a success; each 1 is a Complication Point.
\item \textbf{Outcome}: Basic Roll as-is; Detailed re-roll one 1; Intricate re-roll all 1s and add one positive flourish if successful.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Attributes and Skills}\index{Appendices!Attributes and Skills}

\begin{description}
\item[Body] Strength, endurance, physical force.\index{Attributes!Body}
\item[Wits] Perception, cleverness, reflexes.\index{Attributes!Wits}
\item[Spirit] Willpower, intuition, resilience.\index{Attributes!Spirit}
\item[Presence] Charm, command, social force.\index{Attributes!Presence}

\section{Deck of Consequences}\index{Appendices!Deck of Consequences}

Fate's Edge uses two distinct card tools:

\paragraph{Travel Decks (regional, 52-card).}\index{Decks!Travel}
\emph{Spade}=Place, \emph{Heart}=Actor, \emph{Club}=Pressure, \emph{Diamond}=Leverage. These power journeys and gates.

\paragraph{Deck of Consequences (scene drama).}\index{Decks!Consequences}
\emph{Hearts}=social fallout, \emph{Spades}=harm/escalation, \emph{Clubs}=material cost, \emph{Diamonds}=magical/spiritual disturbance.

\textit{Guidance:} Never mix suit meanings across decks. When a rule references ``Spade/Club/Diamond,'' it means \emph{Travel}. When it says ``Hearts/Spades/Clubs/Diamonds,'' it means \emph{Consequences}.

\subsection{Using the Deck}\index{Appendices!Using the Deck}

After a roll that generates CP, the GM chooses one method for that roll:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Direct Spend}: Translate CP into consequences/rail ticks immediately.
  \item \textbf{Deck Draw}: Draw up to \textbf{min(CP, 3)} cards and synthesize a single twist guided by suit and highest rank.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Consequences Deck Structure}\index{Appendices!Consequences Deck}

\begin{description}
\item[Hearts] Emotional / Social fallout (fear, anger, betrayal)\index{Decks!Consequences!Hearts}
\item[Spades] Physical harm / Obstacles (injuries, blockades, fatigue)\index{Decks!Consequences!Spades}
\item[Clubs] Resource / Wealth loss (gear breaks, expenses rise)\index{Decks!Consequences!Clubs}
\item[Diamonds] Mystical / Narrative twists (omens, curses, chance)\index{Decks!Consequences!Diamonds}
\end{description}

\subsection{Ranks (1--10, J--K--A)}\index{Appendices!Ranks}

\begin{description}
\item[Ace--3] Minor inconvenience or flavor complication.\index{Decks!Ranks!Minor}
\item[4--6] Moderate setback with some narrative teeth.\index{Decks!Ranks!Moderate}
\item[7--9] Significant consequence altering the course of action.\index{Decks!Ranks!Significant}
\item[10--King] Major fallout, introducing new problems or lasting scars.\index{Decks!Ranks!Major}
\end{description}

\section{Player Archetypes}\index{Appendices!Player Archetypes}

\begin{description}
\item[Solo] Invests in Attributes + Skills. Strong spotlight.\index{Character Build!Solo}
\item[Mixed] Balances self with one follower or off-screen assets.\index{Character Build!Mixed Player}

\section{GM Guidance at a Glance}\index{Appendices!GM Guidance}

\begin{itemize}
\item Spend Complication Points to add story problems, not punish.\index{Complication Points!GM Spending}
\item Always tie consequences back to thematic domains (Hearts, Spades, Clubs, Diamonds).\index{Decks!Consequences}
\item Encourage Intricate actions: reward description with rerolls and narrative control.\index{Description Ladder}
\item Let Off-Screen assets resolve downtime problems but keep adventures on the table.\index{Assets!Off-Screen}
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Guardrails (So It Feels Fair)}\index{Appendices!Design Guardrails}

\begin{itemize}
\item Telegraph clocks. Name them aloud or show them in fiction.\index{Clocks!Telegraphing}
\item Spend CP transparently. "I'm using 2 CP to tick Patrol Sweep."\index{Complication Points!Transparent Spending}
\item Always offer a way out. Boon, asset burn, or devil's bargain.\index{Complication Points!Devil's Bargain}
\item Let Fatigue bite. It's your attrition dial; don't be shy.\index{Fatigue}
\end{itemize}

\section{Mechanical Constraints}\index{Appendices!Mechanical Constraints}

    \item \textbf{POSITION}: Controlled | Risky | Desperate (affects success/failure texture).\index{Combat!Position States}
\end{itemize}

\section{Clock Starters (d6 Prompts)}\index{Appendices!Clock Starters}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Peril (6): "They triangulate your hideout." Triggers: noise, bribed neighbor, CP spend.\index{Clocks!Peril}
\item Supply (4): "The cold eats your prep." Triggers: storm, lost mule, CP spend.\index{Clocks!Supply}
\item Doom (8): "Blood moon eats the sky." Triggers: daily tick, ritual step, CP spend.\index{Clocks!Doom}
\item Debt (6): "Collector circles." Triggers: downtime passes, flash spend, CP spend.\index{Clocks!Debt}
\item Injury (4): "Cracking ice underfoot." Triggers: sprint, fall, CP spend.\index{Clocks!Injury}
\item Hunt (6): "Rival fixer stalks your routes." Triggers: contact flips, trace, CP spend.\index{Clocks!Hunt}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sample Play (Clocks + CP + Fatigue)}\index{Appendices!Sample Play}

\subsection{Scene Frame}\index{Appendices!Sample Play!Scene Frame}
Smuggling a witness over the palace wall at night. Active clocks: Patrol Sweep (6) at 3/6, Supply (4) at 1/4.

\subsection{Beats}\index{Appendices!Sample Play!Beats}

\textbf{1) Scout the south wall} Wits+Stealth (5\dice{10}): 10, 8, 6, 3, 1 $\Rightarrow$ 3 hits, 1 CP. GM spends 1 CP: "You succeed, but your old rope is Compromised." Patrol Sweep stays at 3/6.

\textbf{2) Climb with the witness} Body+Athletics (4\dice{10}): 7, 6, 5, 1 $\Rightarrow$ 2 hits, 1 CP. GM spends 1 CP to tick Patrol Sweep $\Rightarrow$ 4/6 and adds pressure: "Lanterns brighten; bootsteps quicken along the inner walk."

\textbf{3) Last push, running low} GM fills Supply to 2/4 due to Significant Time climbing and cold. Face tries to soothe the witness (Presence+Sway, 5\dice{10}): 9, 8, 2, 1, 1 $\Rightarrow$ 2 hits, 2 CP. GM spends 2 CP: +1 Fatigue to the Face (shivering, breathless) and tick Patrol Sweep to 5/6.

\textbf{4) Extraction or collapse} They have a choice: burn a Boon to activate an off-screen contact's garden gate, or risk one more roll with Fatigue penalties. If they roll and give the GM 1 CP, the GM can fill Patrol Sweep to 6/6 $\Rightarrow$ "Cordon slams shut; horns blare. Capture is on the table."

\section*{Acasia}
\textbf{Elite.}
\begin{quote}
"I kept the ledgers when the last governors fled. Law is a map; ours burned. In Acasia the only borders left are curses you learn too late. The ink runs thin where the old roads used to be, and the names of places shift like smoke in the wind. I've seen three different cartographers try to chart our bordersâ€”each map disagreed with the last, and all of them were wrong. The curse doesn't care about parchmentâ€”it cares about blood, about the weight of oaths broken and promises forgotten. Every milepost whispers a different name now, and if you listen too long, you start to forget your own."
\end{quote}
\textbf{Commoner.}
\begin{quote}
"You don't take shelterâ€”you bargain with whatever lives in the dark. Pay in trinkets, or it takes memories. I'm light on both. Last week I traded my grandmother's wedding ring for a night's peace in an abandoned barn. The thing that took it looked almost human, but its eyes were wrongâ€”like staring into deep water. Now I can't remember her face, only that she had kind hands. The ring's gone, the memory's gone, and I'm still hungry. There's a merchant two valleys over who'll give you a vial of forget-me-not tea for a copper pieceâ€”brew it right and you won't remember trading away your nightmares. Problem is, you also won't remember your children's names."
\end{quote}

\section*{Aelaerem}
\textbf{Elite.}
\begin{quote}
"Our hedges are not for show; they are promises plaited green. We tithe milk and song so the old neighbors stay on their side of dusk. Every spring we walk the boundaries, weaving new growth with old wood, singing the songs that hold the wild things at bay. The hedge-witch taught me that a properly tended hedge remembers every word spoken near itâ€”every blessing, every curse, every secret whispered in the dark. We plant according to the moon's phase: rowan for protection, hawthorn for luck, and always, always, a sprig of rosemary to remember the dead. The old neighbors are particular about their dueâ€”too little song and they scratch at the roots; too much milk and they send the crows to peck your crops. Balance is everything."
\end{quote}
\textbf{Commoner.}
\begin{quote}
"The flock startles before the wind turns. When they refuse the east meadow, I refuse it too. Hoofprints don't lieâ€”even the small, barefoot ones. Last harvest moon, all the sheep faced inward, huddled together like they were afraid of something coming from the edges of the field. I found prints in the mud the next morningâ€”too small for any animal I'd ever seen, too deep for the weight they should have been. The old shepherd said once that sheep see what we can't, that their fear is cleaner than ours. They know when the hedge-witch has been walking in her other shape, when the mummers have taken off their masks and forgotten to put them back on. I follow their lead because they've never led me wrong yet."
\end{quote}

\section*{Aeler}
\textbf{Elite.}
\begin{quote}
"Profit is a kind of ballast; it keeps a city steady when the deep knocks. We sell guaranteesâ€”tunnel, treaty, inheritance. Every vault has its price, every passage its fee, every word carved in stone its weight in silver. The Guild Princes don't rule from aboveâ€”we rule from the ledgers, from the careful balance of what goes down and what comes up. When the mountain groans in the night, we don't prayâ€”we calculate. How much stone will shift? What tunnels will need shoring? Which families will lose their birthright to the deep? The answers are always in the numbers, always in the careful accounting of risk versus reward. A guarantee properly worded is worth more than a crown, and lasts longer than most marriages."
\end{quote}
\textbf{Commoner.}
\begin{quote}
"You learn to hear the stone thinking. If it dreams hungry, you wake the alarm and hope the lifts aren't already coming up full. The deep has moods like a sleeping giantâ€”sometimes it snores, sometimes it turns over, sometimes it wakes up hungry. I've been down there for twelve years, and I can tell by the way the walls breathe whether we're safe or not. Last winter, the stone started singing in the third descentâ€”a low hum that made the lamp-wicks flutter. The engineer said it was just gas pockets, but I knew better. Something was listening down there, something that remembered when the vaults were new and the guarantees meant something. We sealed that tunnel for a season, but the singing followed us up."
\end{quote}

\section*{Aelinnel}
\textbf{Elite.}
\begin{quote}
"Equations are cages for impossible beasts. Mind your bars; the numbers will bite if the proof has gaps. In the Mathlands, we don't just calculateâ€”we domesticate. Every formula is a leash, every theorem a collar. I've seen what happens when a proof breaksâ€”when the bars of an equation snap and the beast inside gets loose. Last solstice, the Geometer-General tried to prove the nature of time itself. The equation held for three days, then... something slipped through. Time doubled back on itself for a mile around the academy. Students aged fifty years in an hour, then un-aged just as quickly. The Geometer-General is still trying to solve for what got outâ€”he won't eat, won't sleep, just stares at his chalkboard and mutters about prime numbers and the weight of infinity."
\end{quote}
\textbf{Commoner.}
\begin{quote}
"Master says the kettle is safe because it only screams on prime days. I marked my calendar with bandages. The first month I was apprenticed, I thought he was joking. Then the kettle started screaming on the 2nd, the 3rd, the 5th... always prime numbers. Master's got twenty-seven kettles in his workshop, and they all sing different songs. The copper one hums lullabies to keep the equations docile. The iron one growls warnings when the proofs start to strain. The silver kettleâ€”that one's the worst. It only screams on Mersenne primes, and when it does, the numbers start moving on their own. I've seen equations crawl across the floor like spilled ink, looking for something to calculate. Master says that's what happens when you try to cage infinityâ€”it fights back."
\end{quote}

\section*{Black Banner}
\textbf{Elite.}
\begin{quote}
"A contract is a country small enough to carry. We march inside its borders until someone pays to redraw them. Every clause is a territory, every signature a citizen. I've seen generals surrender entire provinces for the right wording in a rider, and kings give up daughters for a properly witnessed amendment. The beauty of a contract is that it's always negotiableâ€”until the blood starts flowing. Then it becomes something else entirely. My company's banner has changed hands seventeen times in the last decade. Each new captain brings their own interpretation of the original charter, their own understanding of what we're contracted to protect. The men don't care who signs the papersâ€”they care who pays their wages and who leads them into battle."
\end{quote}
\textbf{Commoner.}
\begin{quote}
"Uniform by day, coin by night. If the banners dance with Ykrul or Vilikari, I keep step and count my fingers after. Last campaign, we switched sides three times in as many weeks. First we were protecting a merchant convoy from river pirates, then we were the pirates attacking a noble's estate, then we were the noble's guards putting down a peasant uprising. The captain said it was all according to contractâ€”that the wording was flexible enough to cover any interpretation. By the end, I couldn't remember whose coin I was spending or whose blood was on my sword. The only constant was the paymaster's seal, and even that looked different every payday."
\end{quote}

\section*{Ecktoria}
\textbf{Elite.}
\begin{quote}
"Empire is a habit; we still set tables as if guests will arrive crowned. What we lack in legions we spend in letters. The marble forums echo with the ghosts of senators who never existed, and the basilicas still ring with the voices of laws that were never passed. I've spent three years drafting a treaty with a kingdom that fell to plague twenty years agoâ€”their ambassador arrives every spring, all ceremony and empty titles, and we discuss trade routes that lead to abandoned cities. The coin-house still mints coins bearing the face of an emperor who died before his coronation, because to stop would be to admit that the empire is smaller than we pretend. We are a nation of forms, of the careful ritual of governance performed for an audience of shadows."
\end{quote}
\textbf{Commoner.}
\begin{quote}
"I stamp more seals than I eat meals. Paper walks farther than soldiers do now. Every document that crosses my desk needs three different stamps, two signatures, and a witness who swears they saw it written in triplicate. I've seen trade agreements that were longer than epic poems, marriage contracts that required their own libraries, and death certificates that needed to be notarized by the dead man's living relatives. The clerks have developed a kind of poetry to the processâ€”we can tell just by looking at a document how important it is, how many departments it will need to visit before it's properly dead. The most tragic are the love letters that come through the systemâ€”by the time they're stamped and sealed, the lovers have usually forgotten why they wrote them."
\end{quote}

\section*{Kahfagia}
\textbf{Elite.}
\begin{quote}
"Currents are taxes paid in advance. We collect where winds consent and governors remember who taught them the tide. The sea is the greatest empire builderâ€”every wave carries tribute, every storm redistributes wealth. I've seen merchant fleets founder on reefs that weren't there last season, and fishing villages prosper from currents that bring silver fish instead of the usual bait. The Admiralty Prefect doesn't rule from a throneâ€”he rules from a chart room, watching the dance of wind and water that determines who prospers and who drowns. The Oshiiran taught us that the sea remembers everythingâ€”every dropped anchor, every spilled cargo, every prayer whispered to placate the deep. We collect not just the obvious tariffs, but the subtle ones: the price of safe passage, the cost of favorable winds, the fee for not mentioning the wrecks we know about."

"Salt is honest workâ€”your palms tell the truth by dusk. The empire is ropes and knots; I know which ones hold. Every morning I check the rigging on three different ships, and every evening I can tell by the calluses on my hands which lines were properly secured and which were just for show. The salt gets into everythingâ€”your clothes, your food, your dreams. I've been at sea for fifteen years, and I still wake up thinking I hear the waves. The old salts say that's how you know you're truly part of the fleetâ€”when the sea starts talking to you in your sleep. The Vilikari officers think they understand navigation, but they're still learning to read the wind. They measure distance in leagues; we measure it in the way the spray tastes and the angle of the sun on the water."

"Oars decide what laws can reach. My ships are courts that sit wherever the tide allows. The law is a fluid thing among the skerriesâ€”it changes with the depth of water, with the strength of the wind, with the phase of the moon. I've held court on ice floes, in fog banks, and once on a whale's back when the sea was calm enough to make it work. The River Jarls understand that justice isn't about permanenceâ€”it's about adaptation. A ruling that works in deep water might be useless in the shallows, and a law that serves the mainland is often meaningless among the islands. My authority flows like the tideâ€”strong in some channels, weak in others, always moving, always changing. The only constant is the need for a strong arm and a steady hand on the tiller."

"We read the Yloka by tasteâ€”mud for shallows, iron for towns. When the rowlocks sing, a door is about to open. The river has its own language, and if you listen with more than your ears, it tells you everything you need to know. Sweet water means we're approaching a village that's been good to travelers. Bitter water warns of bandits or bad blood ahead. When the current changes direction suddenly, it's because someone upstream has made a decision that's going to affect us all. The old oarsmen say the river remembers every drop of blood spilled in its waters, and when the time is right, it brings the reckoning to the surface. I've seen fish rise with arrowheads in their bellies, and reeds grow around coins that were lost generations ago."

I've seen kingdoms rise and fall while our flocks grazed the same hills, watched empires crumble while our bells tolled the same hours. The mountain speaks in geological time, in the slow settling of stone and the patient accumulation of snow. Kings come and go like seasons, but the mountain remembers every treaty, every boundary stone, every drop of blood spilled on its slopes. We are the mountain's memory keepers, the ones who ensure that the old agreements hold even when the signatories have forgotten what they promised. The Dwarves understand thisâ€”they know that some things are meant to last longer than human ambition."

"Mist keeps secrets. I keep sheep. Between us, we've hidden whole wars from the world. The mist comes down thick some mornings, so thick you can't see your own hands in front of your face. That's when the real work gets doneâ€”when the sheep move through the fog like ghosts, carrying messages in their wool, hiding refugees in their folds. I've guided armies through the mist without the enemy knowing they were there, smuggled nobles across borders that should have been impassable. The sheep don't care about politicsâ€”they just want good grass and clean water. But they're better at keeping secrets than most people, and they never betray a trust. The mist respects that kind of loyalty."

"Water is the city's memory; every debt finds its level. Our bravos keep the surface calm while old things move below. The canals remember everythingâ€”the weight of every boat, the cargo of every barge, the blood that's been spilled in their depths. I've seen merchants who thought they could escape their obligations by taking ship, only to find that the water carried their debts faster than their sails. The old things beneath the city are patientâ€”they wait for the right moment to surface, when the weight of accumulated sins finally breaks the surface tension. We maintain the delicate balance between order and chaos, between the prosperity that flows on the surface and the corruption that festers below. Every bridge is a negotiation, every canal a compromise with forces that predate the city itself."

The taste of the water tells us what's happening in the districts we can't see, the sound of our oars against the current warns of trouble ahead. When the fog comes down thick over the canals, it's not just visibility that's lostâ€”communication breaks down, alliances shift, and old enemies find themselves rowing side by side. I've carried messages that were worth more than gold, and passengers who were worth less than the air they breathed. The fog doesn't care about your statusâ€”it just wants to know what you're really made of."

I've seen wars averted because of a shared supper, alliances forged over a pot of properly blessed stew. The old table in the High Hall has seen more treaties signed over its surface than any council chamber in the mainland kingdoms. The guests know the rulesâ€”they eat what's offered, drink what's poured, and leave a gift that's appropriate to their station. Break the hospitality, and you break something fundamental about the way the world works. The Green Neighbors are particular about their due."

"Lights on the water mean one of two things: a catch or a bargain. Bring extra salt either way. The fishing boats work by different rules than the mainland vesselsâ€”they understand that the sea is not just a source of food, but a partner in commerce. Every haul from the nets might contain something that's not quite fish, something that's been sent as payment for debts incurred in previous generations. The salt we use isn't just for preserving the catchâ€”it's for seasoning the deals we make with forces that don't always follow human logic. I've seen nets come up heavy with silver coins mixed in with the herring, and I've seen them come up empty when the price wasn't right. The sea keeps its own ledgers, and it's not always interested in human currency."

"Dispute is our sport; we wrestle with premises and shake truth out by the ankle. In the City of a Thousand Stairs, every argument is a climb, every conclusion a summit worth reaching. I've seen philosophers spend years debating the nature of a single word, climbing higher and higher on the scaffolding of logic until they're dizzy with the view. The Synod Hall echoes with the voices of scholars who've dedicated their lives to proving that the opposite of everything is also true. We don't just debate ideasâ€”we inhabit them, live inside their implications until we understand their weight and texture. Truth in Thepyrgos is not a destination but a journey, and the most interesting truths are the ones that lead us to unexpected vistas."

The stonecutters and masons of Thepyrgos understand that knowledge has weightâ€”it needs to be properly supported, given a foundation that won't shift under the pressure of new ideas. I've built lecture halls for philosophers who needed to pace while they thought, constructed viewing platforms for astronomers who wanted to get closer to the sky, and carved steps into solid rock for debates that were expected to last for months. The scholars pay well for quality work, but they also expect their surroundings to reflect the importance of their thoughts. A poorly constructed staircase can undermine an entire philosophical systemâ€”form and function are inseparable in our city."

Every feud adds another name to the list, another obligation that will be passed down through generations.

I've learned to read their behavior like a map, to understand that when they bunch together and face a particular direction, there's something worth paying attention to over the next ridge. The chiefs make their plans in council halls, but the cattle make the real decisions about where we're safe and where we're not. My knife is for protection, but it's also a tool for making offerings to the spirits who watch over the high passes."

The forest counts your footfalls, not your gratitude. It remembers the weight of your need, not the sound of your praise.

The old court is scattered to the winds, but its forms and ceremonies live on in the dreams of those who would restore it.

I've served under seven different lords in as many months, and I've learned that loyalty is a luxury I can't afford. My bowstring stays dry because I never know when I might need to use it, and my oaths are carefully worded to leave room for interpretation.

The rivers are the arteries of Viterra, and those who control the flow of traffic across them control the destiny of the realm.

I've seen merchants who could afford to pay double the normal toll but chose to haggle over a few coppers, and I've seen nobles who tried to cross without payment and found themselves waiting for weeks.
