\section{Player Archetypes}

Not every group plays the same way. These archetypes describe how players spend XP and seek spotlight.

\subsection{The Solo}

\begin{description}
\item[Definition] Invests XP primarily in Attributes and Skills. Minimal followers, minimal holdings. All power is on the sheet.
\item[Typical XP Spread] 70--90\% Self; 0--10\% On-screen help; 0--20\% Off-screen.
\item[Strengths] Consistent scene impact; few moving parts; resilient to follower loss.
\item[Risks] Limited fiction reach between sessions; can stall when problems demand logistics or networks.
\end{description}

\subsection{The Mixed Player}

\begin{description}
\item[Definition] Splits XP between self-growth and one or two meaningful assets (a small follower or a reliable holding).
\item[Typical XP Spread] 50--65\% Self; 15--25\% On-screen help; 15--25\% Off-screen.
\item[Strengths] Versatile: credible in scenes and has a lever for special problems.
\item[Risks] Upkeep pressure; helper can be targeted when the GM spends 2+ Complication Points.
\end{description}

\subsection{The Mastermind}

\begin{description}
\item[Definition] Prioritizes followers/cadres/familiars and off-screen networks. The sheet is the hub of a larger apparatus.
\item[Typical XP Spread] 25--40\% Self; 35--55\% On-screen help; 20--40\% Off-screen.
\item[Strengths] Scene control via assistance; strategic reach between sessions; strong heist/social-planning play.
\item[Risks] Dependency on assist lanes; followers can be endangered on 2+ Complication Point spends; upkeep pressure.
\end{description}

\section{XP Costs}

\subsection{Attributes and Skills}

\begin{description}
\item[Attributes] New rating $\times$ 3 XP
\item[Skills] New level $\times$ 2 XP
\item[Followers (On-Screen)] Cap$^2$ XP
\end{description}

\subsection{Off-Screen Assets}

\begin{description}
\item[Minor] 4 XP
\item[Standard] 8 XP
\item[Major] 12 XP
\end{description}

\section{Tiers of Reputation}

Though there are no levels, XP spent creates soft "tiers" that shape world response:

\begin{description}
\item[Tier I -- Rookie] (0--40 XP): Local reputation; prestige locked.
\item[Tier II -- Seasoned] (41--90): Regional notice; prestige abilities may be unlocked.
\item[Tier III -- Veteran] (91--150): National influence; second follower slot suggested.
\item[Tier IV -- Paragon] (151--220): Movers and shakers; rivals emerge to challenge.
\item[Tier V -- Mythic] (221+): Legendary status; kingdoms and cults respond.
\end{description}
