\chapter{Combat and Conflict}

\section{Core Philosophy}
Combat is violent conflict resolved through the standard consequence mechanics. Every combat action generates potential for both triumph and complication, with consequences that cascade through the same economy as all other challenges.

\section{Resolution Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Declare Action}: Player states intent and approach (Attribute + Skill)
    \item \textbf{Set Position}: GM sets Controlled, Risky, or Desperate based on tactical situation
    \item \textbf{Roll Dice}: Roll pool = Attribute + Skill
    \item \textbf{Count Results}: 6+ = Success, 1 = Complication Point (CP)
    \item \textbf{Apply Outcome}: Use standard Outcome Matrix
    \item \textbf{Manage Consequences}: GM spends CP or draws from Consequences Deck
\end{enumerate}

\section{Position States}
\begin{description}
\item[Controlled] Advantageous position, minor consequences (flanking, higher ground, surprised foe)
\item[Risky] Even odds, moderate consequences (evenly matched, contested terrain)
\item[Desperate] Disadvantaged, severe consequences (outnumbered, wounded, poor positioning)
\end{description}

\section{Combat-Specific Consequence Types}
\begin{description}
\item[Hearts] Morale, fear, command/control breakdown, psychological pressure
\item[Spades] Physical harm, positioning changes, weapon status, tactical wounds
\item[Clubs] Resource depletion, gear damage, fatigue, ammunition/supply issues
\item[Diamonds] Environmental hazards, reinforcements, tactical setbacks, terrain changes
\end{description}

\section{Harm Integration}
Harm tracks directly tie to CP economy:
\begin{description}
\item[Minor (-)] Generate 1 CP on next 2 rolls
\item[Moderate (=)] Generate 1 CP on next roll, -1 die to relevant actions
\item[Severe (≈)] Generate 2 CP on next roll, -2 dice to relevant actions  
\item[Critical (†)] Generate 3 CP on next roll, out of action until treated
\end{description}

\section{Tactical Clocks}
Persistent combat conditions are tracked through clocks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mob Overwhelm} (6): Enemy numbers become advantage
    \item \textbf{Fatigue Spiral} (4): Exhaustion affects performance
    \item \textbf{Morale Collapse} (6): Fear undermines effectiveness
    \item \textbf{Environmental Collapse} (8): Terrain/fire/building failure
\end{itemize}

\section{Position Dynamics}
Position can shift during combat based on CP spending:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1 CP}: Shift position one step (GM choice)
    \item \textbf{Player Spending}: 1 CP to improve position one step
    \item \textbf{Narrative Triggers}: Flanking, reinforcement arrival, environmental changes
\end{itemize}

\section{Magic Combat Integration}
Spellcasting in combat feeds the same consequence economy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Channel/Weave Backlash CP applies to tactical situation
    \item Spells can shift position, create tactical clocks, or generate combat consequences
    \item Magic consequences cascade through existing combat systems
\end{itemize}

\section{Asset/Follower Combat Integration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Follower Risk}: 2+ CP spent in combat can endanger assisting followers
    \item \textbf{Asset Compromise}: Combat in certain locations can damage relevant assets  
    \item \textbf{Offensive Activation}: 1 Boon activates asset for combat advantage
    \item \textbf{Initiative Actions}: Followers can take combat-relevant independent actions
\end{itemize}

\section{Outcome Matrix Application}
Same as standard resolution, but consequences are combat-specific:
\begin{description}
\item[Clean Success] Intent achieved with no tactical complications
\item[Success \& Cost] Intent achieved, but GM spends CP for combat consequences
\item[Partial] Progress with tactical fork (accept cost OR concede ground)
\item[Miss] No progress; GM spends CP for combat consequences OR offers tactical bargain
\end{description}

\section{Social Conflict}

\subsection{Persuasion and Influence}

Social conflicts use the same core mechanics but with different skills:
\begin{itemize}
\item Diplomacy for negotiation and formal discourse
\item Deception for lies, misdirection, and manipulation
\item Performance for oratory, entertainment, and emotional appeal
\item Insight for reading opponents and detecting deception
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Social Position}

\begin{description}
\item[Controlled] You have leverage, information, or social advantage
\item[Risky] Even social ground; standard interaction
\item[Desperate] You're at a disadvantage; opponent has leverage
\end{description}

\subsection{Social Consequences}

Complication Points in social conflicts might manifest as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rumors spread that harm reputation
\item Allies become suspicious or hostile
\item Obligations or concessions must be made
\item Social standing or access is compromised
\end{itemize}

\section{Mass Combat and Warfare}

\subsection{Command and Leadership}

Characters with appropriate skills (Command, Tactics, Leadership) can direct groups in mass conflicts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Assist allies in combat rolls
\item Coordinate tactical maneuvers
\item Rally broken units
\item Influence battle momentum
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Initiative Action}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cost choice: An Initiative Action by a follower costs either Exposure +1 or Harm 1.
    \item Cadence: By default, the crew has 1 Follower Initiative window per scene.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Warfare Clocks}

Large-scale conflicts often use clocks to track:
\begin{itemize}
\item Army morale and cohesion
\item Supply and logistics
\item Strategic positioning
\item Political support and reinforcement
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Command Complications}

When directing mass forces, Complication Points might represent:
\begin{itemize}
\item Units becoming disorganized or scattered
\item Communication breakdowns
\item Supply line disruptions
\item Political interference or betrayal
\end{itemize}

\section{Environmental Hazards}

\subsection{Natural Hazards}

Environmental dangers follow the standard resolution system:
\begin{itemize}
\item Set DV based on hazard severity
\item Players roll appropriate skills to avoid or mitigate
\item Complications represent exposure or partial success
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hazard Clocks}

Persistent environmental threats can be tracked with clocks:
\begin{description}
\item[Fire] Spreading flames, smoke inhalation, structural damage
\item[Flood] Rising water, current strength, debris hazards
\item[Storm] Wind force, precipitation, visibility, structural stress
\item[Earthquake] Ground shaking, structural collapse, aftershocks
\end{description}

\subsection{Environmental Complications}

Complication Points from environmental hazards might cause:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gear damage or loss
\item Terrain changes that complicate movement
\item Exposure leading to Fatigue or Injury
\item Separation of party members
\end{itemize}
