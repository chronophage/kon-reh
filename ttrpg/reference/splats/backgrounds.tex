\section*{Backgrounds and Prestige Backgrounds}

Backgrounds in Fate's Edge are narrative packages that tie your character to a specific place, faction, or tradition. Each requires ownership of a specific Asset and grants a Talent, Perk, and narrative hooks that shape how you engage with the world. Prestige Backgrounds are epic-tier roles earned in play, with powerful abilities and world-shaping consequences.

\subsection*{Prestige Backgrounds (Epic Tier)}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=*]
  
  \item[\textbf{The Cursed Child of Silkstrand}] 
  \textbf{Requires:} Personally mitigate or trigger a major Acasian Curse event; deep tie to Silkstrand. \\
  \textbf{Talent (20 XP, 1/campaign):} Laughter That Ends Sieges — In a moment of absolute desperation, focus the Curse through yourself. End one large-scale conflict in sight (siege, battle, storm) as reality unravels it. No roll. \\
  \textbf{Epic Hook — The Curse Hungers:} The Curse binds to you. At the start of every session, the GM introduces a minor, personal echo (an omission, loop, or wrong reflection) affecting you or allies. GM: bank +2 CP and start/advance a 6-segment Silkstrand Echo Front. \\
  \textbf{Deck Hooks:} Treat any Valewood/Theona 9 drawn in your scenes as yours. Spending a local (e.g., Way-cord) can postpone, not erase, an echo. \\
  \textbf{Scene Keys:} Cursed Crossroads, Affected Estate \\
  \textbf{Hooks (GM on CP spend):} The Curse twists a future success into a failure; A cult of the Curse marks you for meddling; Break one knot; two tighten elsewhere.

  \item[\textbf{Stone-Speaker of Khaz-Vurim}] 
  \textbf{Requires:} Broker a monumental peace between Aeler holds or with a major power; dwarven culture or unprecedented trust. \\
  \textbf{Talent (20 XP, 1/campaign):} Move the Mountain's Will — Call the deep will of the Aelerians to reroute a geological or political reality: open a pass weeks early, flood a rival shaft, or cause a hold to ignore a king's edict. No roll. \\
  \textbf{Epic Hook — The Mountain's Price:} You swear a Geas of Stone. The GM assigns a monumental, slow task against your interests. Until completed, you lose dwarven hospitality and stone-magic benefit (treat social Position as Desperate with Aeler guilds). \\
  \textbf{Deck Hooks:} When used, flip any Aeler played this arc immediately. Start/advance an 8-segment Geas of Stone Front. \\
  \textbf{Scene Keys:} Royal Crypt, Under-Vault Archive \\
  \textbf{Hooks (GM on CP spend):} Ancestral spirit misidentifies you; Senior Adept deems your rite overreaching; You learn a truth damning to a living house.

  \item[\textbf{The Last Dauphin's Shadow}] 
  \textbf{Requires:} Publicly champion, protect, or expose the Sun Court claimant; irrevocably entangled in the cause. \\
  \textbf{Talent (18 XP, 1/campaign):} The Sunburst Warrant — Issue commands obeyed as if from the lost Sun-King: mobilize hidden cells, muster a county levy, or claim noble sanctuary. Choose one concrete objective; it happens, unless physically impossible. No roll. \\
  \textbf{Epic Hook — The Pretender's Toll:} Each use consumes hope. GM selects a loyalist asset to be lost, disillusioned, or exposed. Start/advance a 6-segment Candle of the Sun Front; when it fills, the movement fractures. \\
  \textbf{Deck Hooks:} In Vhasia, treat face-card s as predisposed but legal/economic hits escalate faster. \\
  \textbf{Scene Keys:} Sun Palace, Parlement Hall \\
  \textbf{Hooks (GM on CP spend):} Rival cites deeper bylaw; Your precedent is weaponized immediately; Lanterns malfunction, proving you right but creating Hazard.

  \item[\textbf{Mist-Seer of the Weeping Gate}] 
  \textbf{Requires:} Endure the Direwood and return changed; face a horror beyond common wraiths. \\
  \textbf{Talent (20 XP, 1/campaign):} Bargain with the Deep Mist — Open parley with the Mist's sentience. Ask one true question or command it to withhold influence from a named place/person for a year and a day. No roll. \\
  \textbf{Epic Hook — The Wood Remembers:} Pay a Bargain of Breath: surrender a fundamental memory/name/sense/skill (permanent). GM banks +2 CP and starts a 6-segment Lost Thing Front keyed to what was given up. \\
  \textbf{Deck Hooks:} A Mistlands (Ward-salt or Lantern Writ) can soften—not negate—the next echo of the loss. \\
  \textbf{Scene Keys:} Direwood Edge, Pall Watch-tower \\

  \textbf{Talent (18 XP, 1/campaign):} The Law That Binds Spears — At the Foedus Stone (or an ancient treaty site), impose an absolute truce between two named factions. For its span, any violent act across the line triggers immediate supernatural calamity on the offender. No roll. \\
  \textbf{Epic Hook — The Balance of Grudges:} The hate is compressed, not erased. Begin an 8-segment Coiled Blood Front that passively ticks each session. When it blows, the rematch is worse—your name is on the blame. \\
  \textbf{Deck Hooks:} During the truce, s like Foedus Seal gain +1 practical scope but any hostage automatically targets your allies first on CP spend. \\
  \textbf{Scene Keys:} Foedus Stone, Clan Gathering \\
  \textbf{Hooks (GM on CP spend):} Clan feud rekindles; Rasputitsa traps your party; Salt shortage creates tension.

\subsection*{Background Creation Guidelines}

To create a custom Background:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Name It} — Give it an evocative title.
  \item \textbf{Asset Requirement} — Tie it to a Minor/Standard/Major Asset.
  \item \textbf{Talent} — Choose or design a thematically appropriate Talent (3-6 XP).
  \item \textbf{Perk} — Pick one mechanical benefit (session-limited) with 2-3 options.
  \item \textbf{Scene Keys} — Name two venues where it naturally appears.
  \item \textbf{Hooks} — List 2–3 CP sinks with narrative prompts.
  \item \textbf{Invite (optional)} — Behavior cue that may earn a Boon.
\end{enumerate}

Prestige Backgrounds follow the same structure but require:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Epic-tier prerequisites (significant story investment)
  \item Once-per-campaign Talents (12-20 XP)
  \item Epic Hooks that create lasting world changes
  \item Integration with campaign clocks and fronts
\end{itemize}
