## Core Principles

### The Central Question
What are you willing to risk, and what are you willing to pay, to reshape the world around you?

### Key Concepts

**Narrative Time**
- A Moment: Heartbeat, glance, single strike
- Some Time: Minutes (skirmish, lockpick, negotiation)
- Significant Time: Hours (travel, ritual, siege)
- Days: Large-scale endeavors

**Complication Points (CP)**
- Each die showing 1 generates 1 CP
- GM spends to introduce twists: escalation, exhaustion, exposure, collateral
- Never simple penalties - always narrative fuel

**Affinity**
- Narrative edge/metaphysical bond for races/cultures
- Makes certain Arts, skills, or actions more reliable

**Prestige Abilities**
- High-level talents unlocked by mastering cultural arts
- Narrative milestones as much as mechanical ones

**On-Screen vs. Off-Screen**
- On-Screen: Companions/hirelings who act in scene
- Off-Screen: Taverns, estates, titles, networks shaping story between sessions

## Mechanics Reference

### Core Mechanic: The Art of Consequence

**Procedure:**
1. Approach: Describe intent and method (Attribute + Skill)
2. Execution: Roll dice pool (d10s). 6+ = success, 1 = CP
3. Outcome: GM interprets successes vs. difficulty, spends CP for complications

**Description Ladder:**
- Basic: Roll as-is
- Detailed: Re-roll one 1
- Intricate: Re-roll all 1s + add positive flourish if successful

**Difficulty Ladder:**
- Routine (DV 1): Clear intent, modest stakes
- Pressured (DV 2): Time pressure, mild resistance
- Hard (DV 3): Hostile conditions, active opposition
- Extreme (DV 4+): Multiple constraints, high precision

**Outcome Matrix:**
- Clean Success (S ≥ DV, C = 0): Deliver intent crisply
- Success & Cost (S ≥ DV, C > 0): Grant intent; spend/bank CP for friction
- Partial (0 < S < DV): Progress with fork - get it but [cost] or leave it and [safety]
- Miss (S = 0): No progress; cash/bank CP; consider Devil's Bargain

### Complication Point Spend Menu

**Universal Options:**
- 1 CP: Noise/tell/trace; +1 Supply segment; tool Compromised; +1 round time; bystander notice
- 2 CP: Alarmed attention; lose position/cover; add lesser foe/lock; advance Threat clock; traveler Fatigue 1
- 3 CP: Reinforcements en route; Out of Supply; key gear breaks; split party options; escalate faction clock
- 4+ CP: Major turn - trap springs, rival claims prize, authority arrives; convert saved CP to scene-defining twist

**Combat:**
- 1 CP: lose footing (next defense -1d)
- 2 CP: weapon Compromised
- 3 CP: pinned/disarmed/separated; battlefield shifts

**Stealth & Intrusion:**
- 1 CP: footstep/squeak; shadow seen
- 2 CP: patrol changes; lock resists
- 3 CP: partial alarm
- 4 CP: full alarm and lockdown

**Social:**
- 1 CP: rumor cost or faux pas
- 2 CP: concession required
- 3 CP: rival interjects with leverage
- 4 CP: patron turns, audience hostile

**Travel & Survival:**
- 1 CP: lose time; minor injury; weather turns
- 2 CP: Supply +1 segment; mount lamed
- 3 CP: wrong valley or blocked pass
- 4 CP: storm/rockslide/flood - scene rewritten

**Arcana & Ritual:**
- 1 CP: prickle of backlash; sensory bleed
- 2 CP: unintended side-effect
- 3 CP: residue anchors foe/hex
- 4 CP: backlash condition manifests; ritual mark persists

### XP Economy

**Awards (Session):**
- Table Attendance: +2 XP
- Major Objective: +2-4 XP
- Discovery/Lore: +1-2 XP
- Hard Choice: +1-2 XP
- Complication Spotlight: +1-3 XP

**Spending:**
- Attributes: (new rating × 3) XP
- Skills: (new level × 2) XP
- On-Screen Followers: Cap² XP
- Off-Screen Assets: Minor (4 XP), Standard (8 XP), Major (12 XP)

### Asset & Follower Management

**Followers (On-Screen):**
- Cost: Cap² XP
- Assist: +Cap dice (in-role) or +1 (off-role, intricate)
- Cap: 1-5 (5 is exceptional)
- Upkeep: Coin equal to Cap or scene tending; miss 2 = Unreliable

**Off-Screen Assets:**
- Minor (4 XP): Safehouse, small charter
- Standard (8 XP): Noble title, guild section, spy ring
- Major (12 XP): City license, regional network
- Activation: 1 Boon or 2 XP per distinct outcome

**Condition Tracks:**
- Maintained → Neglected → Compromised
- Repair: Downtime or XP equal to Tier/Cap
- Compromised: Requires mission + repair

## Deck-Based Generators

### Standard Deck Structure
- **Spades**: Places (where events occur)
- **Hearts**: People/Factions (who is involved)
- **Clubs**: Complications/Threats (what makes it messy)
- **Diamonds**: Rewards/Leverage (why it matters)

### Rank Severity & Clock Size
- 2-5 (Minor): 4-segment Clock
- 6-10 (Standard): 6-segment Clock
- J/Q/K (Major): 8-segment Clock
- Ace (Pivotal): 10-segment Clock

### Draw Procedures
- **Quick Hook**: 1 Spade + 1 Heart; higher rank sets Clock

- **Act Builder**: 3 cards (setting, actor, complication) per act

### Combo Rules
- **Pair**: Recurring motif with twist

## Travel Reference

### Core Travel Procedure
1. Draw 3-4 cards: Spade+Heart (destination), Club (pressure), Diamond (authority leverage)
2. Highest rank sets travel clock (2-5→4, 6-10→6, J/Q/K→8, A→10)
3. On success: advance to next leg; on failure: mark delay/debt/diversion

### Regional Routes

**Amaranthine Coastway:** Kahfagia → Ecktoria → Acasia → Marcott (Vhasia) → Fairport (Viterra)
- Club from Wilds; Diamond from port or Kahfagia convoy law

**Astroegro Straits:** Thepyrgos controls the hinge
- Spade/Heart/Club from Thepyrgos; Diamond from Thepyrgos

**Dolmis Circuits:** Fairport → Theona → Ubral fjords → Aelinnel west shore
- Spade/Heart from destination; Club from Linn/Wilds; Diamond from Theona

**Aelerian Passes/Underways:** Vhasia/Viterra/Ubral → Aeler gates → Mistlands
- Spade/Heart/Club from Aeler; Diamond from Aeler (codified outcomes)

**Shadow Corridors:** Valewood east coast (Thin Shore) ↔ Zakov
- Spade from Valewood, Heart from Mistlands/Valewood, Club from Mistlands, Diamond from either
- Rule of 9s: any 9 adds omission

**River Roads:**
- Belworth: Vhasia/Viterra boundary with twin ports
- Yloka: Linn raids into Aberderrin/Dolmis
- Acasian rivers: hazardous approaches to Silkstrand

**Steppe Frontiers:** Ykrul ↔ Vilikari ↔ Ecktoria/Acasia borders
- Spade from road, Heart from counterpart, Club from Wilds/frontier, Diamond from either

### Gateways & Control Points

| Gate | Deck | Diamond Source | Typical Leverage |
|------|------|----------------|------------------|
| Qeresh-on-Sea | Kahfagia | Kahfagia | Convoy letter, lantern-law warrant |
| Ecktoria Capital | Ecktoria | Ecktoria | Berth priority, coin-house credit |
| Silkstrand | Acasia | Acasia | Exchange floor access, condotta |
| Marcott | Vhasia | Vhasia | Letters patent, safe-conduct |
| Fairport | Viterra | Viterra | Customs seal, ferry priority |
| Tarlington Falls | Viterra | Viterra | Lift priority, bridge pass |
| Thepyrgos Boom | Thepyrgos | Thepyrgos | Harbor pass, crane allotment |
| High-Mist Pass | Aeler | Aeler | Underway pass, Key-Writ |
| Payden's Port | Mistlands | Mistlands | Lantern writ, ward-salt |
| Thin Shore | Valewood/Mistlands | Either | Way-cord, lantern writ |
| Green Gate | Aelinnel | Aelinnel | Tide-path key, host-right |

| Zakov Roadstead | Theona/Linn | Either | Raid-truce ribbon, whale-road escort |

### Special Travel Rules

**Theona/Valewood 9s:** Add omission (missing step, unsaid name, unseen guest). Diamond 9 allows taboo break (someone collects later).

**Aeler Aces:** Can rewire routes beneath mountains. Swap Spade to Aeler (keep other cards) for under-vault procedures.

**Echoing Omens:** Any A adds motif to echo later (ash on wind, bell heard underground, landmark elsewhere).

### Magic System Summary

**Casting Loop:**
1. **Channel:** Wits + Arcana to gather Potential (1s = immediate CP)
2. **Weave:** Wits + Art to shape spell (Description Ladder applies)
3. **Backlash:** CP manifest as thematic consequences

**Backlash Severity:**
- 1-2 CP: Minor nuisance/tell
- 3-4 CP: Noticeable setback (hazard, new pressure)
- 5+ CP: Major turn (scene shift, new foe/clock, severe condition)

**Global Guardrails:**
- Duration defaults: buffs 3 beats, areas 1 beat (sustain = 1 Fatigue/beat)
- Same-Art buffs don't stack
- Spells can't create Diamonds
- Active spell advantages count toward Over-Stack

### Resource Management

**Supply Clock:**
- Full (0): Well-equipped
- Low (2): Minor complications
- Dangerously Low (3): Fatigue to all
- Out (4): Severe penalties

**Fatigue:**
- Effect: Re-roll successes (1 Fatigue = 1 re-roll, 2 = 1 re-roll, 3 = 2 re-rolls, 4 = collapse)
- Recovery: Night's rest with adequate supply removes 1

**Gear Condition:**
- **Compromised:** -1 die on relevant rolls
- **Breaking Point:** Second setback = broken
- **Repair:** Field (temporary) or proper (permanent, tools/materials/downtime)

### Complication Management

**Deck of Consequences:**
- Suits = Domains (Cups=Emotional, Swords=Harm, Pentacles=Resource, Wands=Magical)
- Ranks = Severity (Ace-3=Minor, 4-6=Moderate, 7-9=Significant, 10-King=Major)

**CP Economy:**
- Bank CP to escalate future beat in same scene/arc
- Convert banked CP to front-loaded complication at arc start
- Avoid nickel-and-diming; prefer memorable complications

### Combat & Conflict

**Position States:**
- **Controlled:** Advantageous position
- **Risky:** Even odds
- **Desperate:** Disadvantageous position

**Effect Scale:**
- **Limited:** Minor impact
- **Standard:** Clear impact
- **Strong:** Major impact

**Stress, Harm & Loss:**
- **Pin:** Follower separated/boxed out
- **Wound:** Follower Injured (Cap 1 lower until treated)
- **Burn:** Follower Neglected immediately
- **Seize:** Escalate to Compromised (capture, flight, betrayal)

This modular reference organizes the core mechanics, regional generators, and travel procedures of Fate's Edge into a coherent GM toolkit. The document emphasizes the system's focus on narrative consequences over mechanical bookkeeping, providing clear procedures for generating complications, managing resources, and creating meaningful choices for players.
