### **Fate's Edge: The Warlock's Path - Rites of the Outer Spheres**

This expansion introduces Runekeepers, where pacts and rites bind practitioners to alien powers and metaphysical forces. These Rites are more structured and potent than ad-hoc Rituals, but carry inherent risks and require specific foci.

**Core Concepts:**

*   **Patrons:** Aliens, archetypal forces, or entities from the metaphysical "outer spheres" (echoing Kon'reh's "Sacred Geometry" or "The Witness"). They grant power through specific Rites.
*   **Rites:** Structured, named pacts or ceremonies that establish or deepen the bond with a Patron. They are learned (cost XP) and require specific foci to *invoke*.
*   **Foci:** Two specific items are required:
    *   **Codex of the Outer Sphere (Asset - Minor to Standard):** A book, grimoire, or collection of knowledge detailing the Rites of one or more Patrons. This is the "how-to" guide.
    *   **Thiasos (Follower - Cap 2):** A supernatural companion bound to the Patron, serving as a conduit and anchor. This is the "who you talk to."
*   **Invocation:** To use a Rite's benefit, you must spend a Boon. This represents the act of calling upon your Patron through the Rite. Failure or misuse draws attention.
*   **Clearing Segments:** To represent the ongoing relationship and the cost of power, each known Rite has a "Patron Obligation Clock" (4-6 segments). Segments fill with CP generated by using the Rite. Spending a Boon can clear one segment (representing devotion/propitiation). If the clock fills, the Patron's attention turns problematic.
*   **Risk:** Rites "appeal to powers beyond human ken" and can draw unwanted attention or have unforeseen consequences.

### **New Character Options & Mechanics**

**1. Follower (Thiasos - Cap 2):**
*   **Cost:** CapÂ² XP = 4 XP
*   **Specialty:** Patron Conduit
*   **Effect:** This supernatural companion (beast, fairy, shadow, homunculus, etc.) is bound to one of your Patrons. It provides +1 assist die to relevant rolls involving that Patron. Its primary role is to facilitate Rites.
*   **Risk:** 2+ CP spent in a scene involving the Patron or Rites can endanger the Thiasos (Exposure +1 or Harm). A character may only have Thiasos. Changing to a different Patron involves purchasing another Thiasos. Add +1 Banked CP per filled Segment.

**2. Asset (Codex of the Outer Sphere):**
*   **Cost:** 4 XP (Minor) to 8 XP (Standard)
*   **Effect (Minor):** Contains the knowledge for 1 Rite.
*   **Effect (Standard):** Contains the knowledge for 2-3 Rites, often related to a specific Patron or theme.
*   **Upkeep:** Clears 1 segment from *one* of its associated Rites' Patron Obligation Clocks during Downtime (representing study and maintenance).

**3. Rites (Learned Abilities - Cost XP):**
*   **Learning Cost:** 6-12 XP (Mid to Prestige level).
*   **Requirements:** Must possess a Codex containing the Rite and a Thiasos.
*   **Activation:** Spend 1 Boon.
*   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 4-6 segments. Fills with CP generated by using the Rite.
*   **Clearing:** Spending 1 Boon clears 1 segment *during play*. Downtime Upkeep (via Codex) clears 1 segment.
*   **Patron Attention:** If the clock fills, the GM introduces a significant complication related to the Patron (e.g., direct intervention, a Geasa, a rival cult's notice, a personal price demanded).

### **Known Patrons & Rites**

**1. The Witness (Archetypal Force of Observation & Truth)**
*   **Flavor:** Knowledge gained at the cost of being seen. Keeper of hidden truths.
*   **Rite: "Veil of the Unseen Observer" (Cost: 7 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A drop of blood on the Codex's page, a strand of hair from the Thiasos woven into a knot.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Gain +2 dice to any roll involving perception, investigation, or recalling hidden information for one scene. You can also ask one specific, factual question about the current situation, and the GM must answer truthfully if the information exists.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 5 Segments. CP generated by using this Rite often relate to "Exposure" (being noticed while observing) or "Hearts" (the burden of knowing).
    *   **Patron Attention:** The Witness demands discretion. If the clock fills, you become a known observer, attracting those who wish secrets kept, or the truth you sought becomes a dangerous burden.
**Low-Power Rite:** "Eyes in the Shadow" (Cost: 6 XP)
    *   **Materials:** A piece of obsidian held by the Thiasos, a drop of the Warlock's blood on the Codex page.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one scene, you automatically succeed on one Notice roll that doesn't require special senses (no roll needed). Alternatively, ask one yes/no question about your immediate surroundings.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 4 Segments. CP relate to "Exposure" (being noticed while observing) or "Hearts" (psychological strain).
    *   **Patron Attention:** The Witness demands discretion. Minor attention might mean you become slightly more noticeable to those who prefer secrecy.
**High-Stakes Rite:** "Gaze of Absolute Truth" (Cost: 12 XP)
    *   **Materials:** A mirror that has reflected the face of someone who has died, blessed by the Thiasos during a ritual described in the Codex.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one scene, you cannot be lied to - all Deceive attempts against you automatically generate CP for the liar. Additionally, you can see through all illusions and disguises within near range. You may also ask the GM one question about the true nature of a person, place, or thing that has been magically altered.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP relate to "Exposure" (becoming a known observer) or "Hearts" (the burden of knowing dangerous truths).
    *   **Patron Attention:** The Witness's scrutiny attracts those who wish secrets kept. Major attention might mean powerful entities actively work to blind or deceive the Warlock, or the truth they sought becomes a dangerous burden that hunts them.

**2. The Sacred Geometry (Archetypal Force of Underlying Order & Pattern)**
*   **Flavor:** Power over structure, probability, and the fundamental "rules" of reality.
*   **Rite: "Thread the Loom of Chance" (Cost: 9 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A geometric drawing traced in ash on the ground, a thread from the Thiasos stretched across it.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one roll, you may re-roll *all* dice, not just 1s. This represents subtly bending probability. Alternatively, you can spend this Boon to downgrade a "Miss" or "Partial" outcome to a "Success & Cost" on a single roll (you succeed, but the GM spends CP as normal).
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP often relate to "Diamonds" (magical/spiritual disturbance, reality "noticing" the tweak) or "Clubs" (the "cost" of bending probability manifests elsewhere).
    *   **Patron Attention:** The Geometry abhors chaos. If the clock fills, reality might "correct" your manipulations in an inconvenient way, or you attract the attention of entities who police the fundamental laws.
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Find the Pattern" (Cost: 7 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A simple geometric shape drawn in chalk by the Thiasos, a thread from the Warlock's clothing stretched across it.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Gain +1 die to one Investigation or Lore roll involving patterns, codes, or mechanical systems. Alternatively, you may re-roll one die showing 1 on any roll involving mathematics or logical deduction.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 4 Segments. CP relate to "Diamonds" (magical/spiritual disturbance) or "Clubs" (minor resource consumption).
    *   **Patron Attention:** The Geometry abhors chaos. Minor attention might mean small mechanical devices around the Warlock begin behaving oddly or attracting minor scrutiny.
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Rewrite the Fundamental Equation" (Cost: 13 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A complex geometric diagram traced in rare powders by the Thiasos, a mathematical proof written in the Warlock's blood on the Codex.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one scene, you may treat one rule of physics or magic as if it were different (GM's discretion, but significant - gravity reverses in a zone, fire burns cold, etc.). This affects the entire scene. Alternatively, downgrade any "Miss" result to "Success & Cost" once per scene.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP relate to "Diamonds" (reality noticing the tweak) or "Clubs" (the cost of bending fundamental laws manifests elsewhere).
    *   **Patron Attention:** The Geometry demands balance. Major attention might mean reality "corrects" the manipulation catastrophically, or the Warlock attracts the attention of entities who police the fundamental laws with extreme prejudice.

**3. Ikasha, "She Who Sleeps in the Shadows" (Entity - Embodiment of Latent Potential & Hidden Depths)**
*   **Flavor:** Power drawn from the unseen, the potential within, and the darkness between.
*   **Rite: "Draw from the Umbral Reservoir" (Cost: 8 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Performing the Rite in complete darkness, a vial of shadow-stuff collected by the Thiasos.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Gain +2 dice to one roll that involves stealth, deception, or tapping into hidden potential/inner strength. Alternatively, clear one level of Fatigue from yourself or an ally.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 4 Segments. CP often relate to "Spades" (direct harm from shadow stuff, exhaustion) or "Hearts" (psychological strain from the depths).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Ikasha's gifts come from the depths. A full clock might mean she starts to wake within you, demanding more shadow, secrecy, or a significant personal sacrifice to remain dormant.
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Touch the Umbral Veil" (Cost: 6 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A small piece of dark cloth blessed in shadow by the Thiasos, performed in dim light.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Gain start Controlled on one Stealth roll this scene. Alternatively, add +1 effect to one action involving hiding or moving quietly.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 4 Segments. CP relate to "Spades" (minor harm from shadow stuff) or "Hearts" (psychological strain).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Ikasha's gifts come from the depths. Minor attention might mean the Warlock feels slightly more comfortable in darkness but slightly uneasy in light.
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Become the Shadow Itself" (Cost: 12 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Performing the Rite in complete darkness, a vial of essence collected from the Thiasos's shadow, the Warlock's own shadow separated and bound to the Codex.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one scene, you become immune to non-magical physical harm and can pass through small openings as shadow. You gain +2 dice to all Stealth actions and automatically succeed on one escape attempt. However, you cannot interact with physical objects normally.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 5 Segments. CP relate to "Spades" (direct harm from shadow stuff, exhaustion) or "Hearts" (psychological disassociation from physical self).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Ikasha's embrace is deep. Major attention might mean she begins to wake within the Warlock, demanding they spend increasing amounts of time in darkness, or the Warlock's physical body begins to fade while their shadow self grows stronger.

**4. Khemesh, the Kracken (Entity - Embodiment of Crushing Depths & Overwhelming Force)**
*   **Flavor:** Raw, destructive power and the inevitability of being dragged down.
*   **Rite: "Command the Grasp of the Abyss" (Cost: 10 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** An object symbolic of something to be "dragged down" (e.g., a piece of armor, a token of pride), submerged in salt water blessed by the Thiasos.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one action, you may force an opponent into a **Desperate** Position if they are not already there. Alternatively, add +2 effect to one physical attack or act of destruction.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP often relate to "Spades" (harm, collateral damage) or "Clubs" (resources consumed by the effort).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Khemesh's power is hungry and destructive. A full clock might mean he begins to manifest physically, demanding sacrifices or dragging the Warlock (or someone close) partially into his realm.
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Grasp of the Minor Depth" (Cost: 7 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A small weight submerged in salt water blessed by the Thiasos, an object representing something to be "pulled down" slightly.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Add +1 effect to one physical action involving pulling, dragging, or applying pressure. Alternatively, force one opponent to generate CP on a successful attack roll against you (their choice of suit).
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 5 Segments. CP relate to "Spades" (minor harm, collateral damage) or "Clubs" (resources consumed).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Khemesh's power is hungry. Minor attention might mean the Warlock feels slightly stronger but hungrier, or small objects around them seem to gather dust and grime faster.
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Command the Abyssal Maw" (Cost: 13 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** An object of significant personal value to the Warlock, submerged in seawater mixed with the Thiasos's blessing, during a storm.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one action, you may force all opponents in the scene into a Desperate Position if they are not already there. Alternatively, add +3 effect to one action focused purely on destruction or dragging something down/into darkness.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP relate to "Spades" (severe harm, massive collateral damage) or "Clubs" (significant resources consumed by the effort).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Khemesh's hunger is vast. Major attention might mean he begins to manifest physically more frequently, demanding regular sacrifices, or the Warlock starts to partially merge with abyssal depths (gaining aquatic abilities but vulnerabilities).

**5. RaÃ©yn "of the Sea" (Entity - Embodiment of Tides, Change, and the Unknowable Deep)**
*   **Flavor:** Power over currents, change, and the cyclical nature of fortune.
*   **Rite: "Ride the Tides of Fate" (Cost: 8 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Sea water or rainwater poured over the Codex, a scale or feather from the Thiasos (if aquatic/airborne).
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** You may shift one existing, declared Complication Point (CP) spent by the GM to a *different* suit/category of your choice (e.g., turn a Spades "Harm" complication into a Clubs "Resource" complication). Alternatively, gain +1 die to any roll involving travel by water or navigating change/flux.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 5 Segments. CP often relate to "Diamonds" (magical disturbance, the sea's indifference) or "Clubs" (the "cost" of the tide turning elsewhere).
    *   **Patron Attention:** RaÃ©yn's gifts are fickle. A full clock might mean the tides turn against you in a major way, or the Warlock is compelled to undertake a dangerous journey by sea.
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Read the Gentle Current" (Cost: 6 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Sea water or rainwater poured over the Codex page, a scale from the Thiasos if aquatic.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Gain +1 die to one roll involving navigation, weather prediction, or understanding flow/currents. Alternatively, you may shift one existing, minor CP (1 CP) spent by the GM to a different suit/category.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 4 Segments. CP relate to "Diamonds" (magical disturbance) or "Clubs" (minor resource cost).
    *   **Patron Attention:** RaÃ©yn's gifts are fickle. Minor attention might mean the tides seem slightly more unpredictable around the Warlock, or they feel a constant, mild restlessness.
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Call the Storm's Judgment" (Cost: 12 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Sea water mixed with the Warlock's tears or blood, poured over the Codex during a natural storm, the Thiasos howling into the wind.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** You may declare that the natural forces of the environment (weather, tides, currents) actively oppose one named target for the rest of the scene. They suffer -1 die to all actions and generate CP whenever they succeed on rolls involving movement or physical exertion. Alternatively, clear all Fatigue from yourself and all allies within near range.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP relate to "Diamonds" (magical disturbance, the sea's full attention) or "Clubs" (resources consumed, the "cost" of the tide turning elsewhere affects allies).
    *   **Patron Attention:** RaÃ©yn's judgment is absolute. Major attention might mean the Warlock becomes a permanent weather anomaly, attracting storms wherever they go, or they must undertake a dangerous journey by sea as penance for disturbing natural balance.

**6. The Clockwork Demon (Archetypal Force of Forbidden Technology & Entropy)**
*   **Flavor:** Power over gears, mechanisms, and the inevitable decay of all things, including the flesh. Brings forbidden knowledge at the cost of humanity.
*   **Rite: "Wind the Gears of the Proscribed" (Cost: 9 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A broken piece of mundane technology, a gear tooth from the Thiasos (if it's a clockwork familiar) or a drop of the Warlock's blood mixed with oil.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** You can temporarily repair or enhance a broken or simple device with impossible efficiency for one scene (e.g., a broken gun fires one last perfect shot, a rusted lock opens, a jammed mechanism works once). Alternatively, gain +2 dice to one Crafts or Engineering roll involving unconventional or "forbidden" methods.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 5 Segments. CP often relate to "Clubs" (resources consumed, device breaking down later) or "Spades" (harm from unstable/forbidden tech) or "Diamonds" (attracting the notice of those who guard such knowledge).
    *   **Patron Attention:** The Demon's gifts erode the boundary between tool and trap. A full clock might mean a significant piece of technology the Warlock relies on becomes cursed, sentient, or starts to merge with their flesh, or agents of the "proper order" come to confiscate or destroy the Warlock's work.
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Whisper to the Gears" (Cost: 7 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A small broken gear, oiled with a drop of the Warlock's blood mixed with oil blessed by the Thiasos.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Gain +1 die to one Crafts or Engineering roll involving simple mechanisms. Alternatively, a simple broken device (lock, basic tool) works once despite being damaged.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 4 Segments. CP relate to "Clubs" (resources consumed) or "Spades" (minor harm from unstable tech).
    *   **Patron Attention:** The Demon's gifts erode boundaries. Minor attention might mean simple mechanical devices around the Warlock become slightly more temperamental or develop minor, harmless quirks.
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Wind the Engine of Forbidden Knowledge" (Cost: 13 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A complex piece of broken technology, a gear tooth from the Thiasos if it's a clockwork familiar, the Warlock's blood mixed with rare alchemical oils.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** You can temporarily repair, enhance, or create a complex device with impossible efficiency for one scene (e.g., a broken firearm fires continuously without reloading, a rusted engine runs perfectly, a simple automaton springs to life). The effect is dramatic and obvious. Alternatively, gain +3 dice to one Crafts or Engineering roll involving unconventional or "forbidden" methods.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP relate to "Clubs" (significant resources consumed, device breaking down spectacularly later) or "Spades" (severe harm from unstable/forbidden tech) or "Diamonds" (attracting the notice of those who guard such knowledge with extreme prejudice).
    *   **Patron Attention:** The Demon's work is irreversible. Major attention might mean a significant piece of technology the Warlock relies on becomes cursed or sentient, agents of the "proper order" come to confiscate or destroy the Warlock's work with extreme prejudice, or the Warlock begins to partially merge with mechanical systems.

**7. Isoka, Sister of Ikasha, Angel of Serpents (Entity - Embodiment of Sinuous Change & Transformation)**
*   **Flavor:** Power over physical and metaphysical transformation, shedding the old self, and the supple strength of the serpent.
*   **Rite: "Shed the Skin of the Former Self" (Cost: 8 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** An item representing an old identity or aspect the Warlock wishes to discard (burned and its ash mixed with the Thiasos's saliva or ichor), a snake skin if available.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Gain +2 dice to resist a specific ongoing Condition (physical or mental) for one scene, representing a partial "shedding." Alternatively, you can re-roll one die showing 1 on any roll involving escape, evasion, or physical flexibility. Once per session, you may also invoke this Boon to retroactively declare you had a contingency for a minor, immediate physical problem (e.g., had a key hidden, a breath left underwater, a limb able to twist free).
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 4 Segments. CP often relate to "Hearts" (psychological dissonance from change, loss of identity) or "Spades" (physical stress or backlash from transformation).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Isoka's gifts demand a price. A full clock might mean the Warlock must undergo a significant, painful, or identity-altering transformation (losing a Skill, gaining a permanent physical Condition) or face a crisis where their old identity returns to haunt them.
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Loosen the Old Skin" (Cost: 6 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A small piece of shed skin or old clothing burned and its ash mixed with the Thiasos's saliva.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Gain +1 die to resist one ongoing Condition (physical or mental) for one scene. Alternatively, re-roll one die showing 1 on any roll involving escape or evasion.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 3 Segments. CP relate to "Hearts" (psychological dissonance) or "Spades" (physical stress).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Isoka's gifts demand change. Minor attention might mean the Warlock feels slightly uncomfortable in their current clothes or appearance, or experiences minor identity confusion.
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Complete Metamorphosis" (Cost: 12 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** An item representing the Warlock's core identity burned completely, the Thiasos shedding its own skin/form during the ritual, performed at a crossroads or place of transformation.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one scene, you may completely change your physical appearance and voice, gaining start Controlled on all Deceive and Stealth rolls. Alternatively, you can retroactively declare you had any minor contingency for an immediate physical problem (had a key, breath left underwater, etc.) once per scene for the rest of the session.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 5 Segments. CP relate to "Hearts" (severe psychological dissonance, loss of identity) or "Spades" (physical stress or backlash from transformation).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Isoka's transformation is total. Major attention might mean the Warlock must undergo a significant, painful, or identity-altering transformation (losing a Skill permanently, gaining a permanent physical Condition), or their old identity returns to haunt them with supernatural vengeance.

**8. Inaea, Sister of Ikasha and Isoka, Angel of the Spider (Entity - Embodiment of Webs, Fate, and Patient Manipulation)**
*   **Flavor:** Power over connections, binding others to fate, and seeing the intricate patterns of causality.
*   **Rite: "Weave the Strand of Inevitability" (Cost: 10 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A web spun by the Thiasos (if arachnid) or a length of fine thread blessed by it, a drop of blood from a target (or an object strongly connected to them).
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** You can declare that two seemingly separate events or actions are subtly linked by fate. For example, an opponent's movement in one zone makes them vulnerable in another, or an action taken now has a pre-ordained consequence later. This usually manifests as forcing an opponent to generate CP of a specific suit (GM's choice, often Hearts for social manipulation or Spades for physical entanglement) or granting the Warlock a +1 die bonus to a related roll later in the scene/act. Alternatively, gain +2 dice to any roll involving tracking, predicting an opponent's moves, or setting up a complex, multi-step plan.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP often relate to "Hearts" (manipulation backlash, targets becoming aware) or "Diamonds" (fate noticing the weave and demanding balance).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Inaea's webs are intricate and binding for all involved. A full clock might mean the Warlock becomes trapped in their own web of fate, or an enemy learns to use the same power against them, or a significant "knot" in the Warlock's own fate tightens, demanding resolution.
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Tie a Simple Knot" (Cost: 7 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A length of fine thread blessed by the Thiasos, a drop of blood from the Warlock.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** You can declare that two minor, related events are subtly linked by fate (e.g., an opponent's movement gives you a slight advantage, or your action has a minor beneficial consequence later). This usually manifests as forcing an opponent to generate 1 CP of a specific suit or granting the Warlock a +1 die bonus to a related roll later in the scene.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 5 Segments. CP relate to "Hearts" (minor manipulation backlash) or "Diamonds" (fate noticing the weave).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Inaea's webs are intricate. Minor attention might mean the Warlock feels slightly more "connected" to people around them (knowing when they're thinking of them) or minor coincidences seem to follow them.
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Weave the Tapestry of Inevitability" (Cost: 13 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A web spun by the Thiasos if arachnid, blessed with the blood of three different people involved in the fate being woven, a drop of blood from each target (or objects strongly connected to them).
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** You can declare that multiple events or actions across the scene are subtly linked by fate. For the rest of the scene, whenever one named target succeeds on a roll, another named target automatically suffers a consequence (generates CP, loses position, etc.). Alternatively, gain +2 dice to any roll involving tracking, predicting opponent moves, or setting up a complex, multi-step plan that spans multiple beats.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP relate to "Hearts" (manipulation backlash, targets becoming powerfully aware) or "Diamonds" (fate noticing the weave and demanding significant balance).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Inaea's webs bind all. Major attention might mean the Warlock becomes trapped in their own web of fate (their actions have severe unintended consequences), an enemy learns to use the same power against them, or a significant "knot" in the Warlock's own fate tightens, demanding resolution through a major quest or sacrifice.

**9. Mor'iraath, Demon of Fire and Consumption (Entity - Embodiment of Destructive Flame and Ravenous Hunger)**
*   **Flavor:** Power over annihilating fire, consuming passion, and the raw, destructive force that burns away everything, including the user.
*   **Rite: "Kindle the Ember of Annihilation" (Cost: 9 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Something precious to the Warlock burned as an offering, a flame lit from the Thiasos's breath (if it can breathe fire) or a focus item heated until it glows.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Your next damaging action (attack, destructive spell, sabotage) gains the "Severe" Harm trait (generates 2 CP on the next roll) if it hits. Alternatively, add +2 effect to one action focused purely on destruction (burning a building, obliterating evidence). You may also invoke this Boon to ignore the first level of Fatigue you would take from exertion in a single, intense burst of activity.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 5 Segments. CP often relate to "Spades" (harm to the Warlock from the intensity) or "Clubs" (resources consumed by the fire, unintended damage).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Mor'iraath's hunger is never sated. A full clock might mean the fire turns on the Warlock or their allies, or the Demon demands a larger, more significant sacrifice, or the Warlock gains a permanent "Burning" Condition that flares up under stress.
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Spark of the Inner Flame" (Cost: 7 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Something small but precious to the Warlock burned as an offering, a flame lit from the Thiasos's breath if it can breathe fire.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Add +1 effect to one action focused on destruction or passion (burning a letter, intimidating an opponent). Alternatively, ignore the first level of Fatigue you would take from exertion in a single, brief burst of activity.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 4 Segments. CP relate to "Spades" (minor harm from the intensity) or "Clubs" (resources consumed).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Mor'iraath's hunger grows. Minor attention might mean the Warlock feels slightly warmer than normal, or small fires seem drawn to them.\
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Unleash the Ember of Total Annihilation" (Cost: 13 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Something of immense personal value to the Warlock burned completely, a flame lit from the Thiasos's most powerful breath, performed in a place where fire is forbidden or dangerous.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Your next damaging action (attack, destructive spell, sabotage) gains the "Critical" Harm trait (generates 3 CP on the next roll) if it hits. Alternatively, add +3 effect to one action focused purely on destruction (burning a building down, obliterating evidence, causing a massive explosion). You may also invoke this Boon to ignore the first two levels of Fatigue you would take from exertion in a single, intense burst of activity.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP relate to "Spades" (severe harm to the Warlock from the intensity) or "Clubs" (massive resources consumed by the fire, unintended catastrophic damage).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Mor'iraath's hunger is insatiable. Major attention might mean the fire turns on the Warlock or their allies with supernatural malevolence, the Demon demands a larger, more significant sacrifice (a life, a soul), or the Warlock gains a permanent "Burning" Condition that flares up under stress and is difficult to control.

**10. Mykkiel, Angel of Law and Order (Entity - Embodiment of Codified Justice and Inexorable Process)**
*   **Flavor:** Power drawn from structure, justice (however defined by the Codex), and the weight of authority. Grants power through adherence to rules or invoking righteous judgment.
*   **Rite: "Proclaim the Edict of the Justiciar" (Cost: 8 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Reading aloud from the Codex (which contains the specific "law" being invoked), the Thiasos standing as a witness or bearing the symbol of the law.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one scene, you gain a +1 die bonus to all Command, Diplomacy, or social rolls where you are acting as an authority figure or enforcing a known law/rule. Alternatively, you can invoke this Boon to force an opponent who has just succeeded in an action against you to "pay the price" - they must either accept a minor, immediate narrative consequence (a Condition like "Off-Balance," losing a Boon, taking +1 Fatigue) or re-roll their successful action at a -1 die penalty.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 4 Segments. CP often relate to "Hearts" (resentment, accusations of hypocrisy) or "Clubs" (bureaucratic entanglements, the law's demand for equal application).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Mykkiel's power is absolute but demands absolute adherence. A full clock might mean the Warlock is called upon to judge a difficult case where the "just" outcome is terrible, or they are targeted by those who hate the law they represent, or they must undergo a trial themselves to prove their worthiness.
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Invoke the Letter of the Law" (Cost: 6 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Reading aloud a specific law or rule from the Codex, the Thiasos standing as a witness.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one roll, gain +1 die if you are acting as an authority figure or enforcing a known law/rule. Alternatively, you can invoke this Boon to force an opponent who has just succeeded in a minor action against you to "pay the price" - they must either accept a minor, immediate narrative consequence (a Condition like "Off-Balance," losing a Boon) or re-roll their successful action at a -1 die penalty.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 3 Segments. CP relate to "Hearts" (resentment, accusations of hypocrisy) or "Clubs" (minor bureaucratic entanglements).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Mykkiel's power demands adherence. Minor attention might mean the Warlock attracts minor bureaucratic scrutiny or feels compelled to correct small injustices they witness.
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Declare the Judgement of the Justiciar" (Cost: 12 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Reading aloud from the Codex (which contains the specific "law" being invoked), the Thiasos bearing the symbol of divine authority, performed in a place of judgment or conflict.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one scene, you gain a +2 die bonus to all Command, Diplomacy, or social rolls where you are acting as an authority figure or enforcing law/rule. Additionally, any opponent who acts against you in a way that clearly violates a known law or principle must generate CP of the Hearts suit. Alternatively, you can invoke this Boon to force an opponent who has just succeeded in any action against you to "face judgment" - they must either accept a significant immediate narrative consequence (a major Condition, severe Harm, loss of a major asset) or re-roll their successful action at a -2 die penalty.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 5 Segments. CP relate to "Hearts" (significant resentment, accusations of tyranny or hypocrisy) or "Clubs" (major bureaucratic entanglements, the law's demand for equal application even when inconvenient).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Mykkiel's judgment is absolute. Major attention might mean the Warlock is called upon to judge a difficult case where the "just" outcome is terrible and has major consequences, they are targeted by those who hate the law they represent with extreme prejudice, or they must undergo a trial themselves to prove their worthiness with severe consequences for failure.

*   **Varnek Karn, the Bone King (Undead)**
*   **Flavor:** Sovereign of the Necropolis, master of death's domain. Varn Karak represents the inexorable march of death and the power that comes from mastery over the dead and the knowledge of mortality.
*   **Rite: "Command the Restless Dead" (Cost: 9 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A bone token from a corpse, blessed by the Thiasos in a minor ritual described in the Codex.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one scene, you may command a number of minor undead equal to your Arcana skill (treat as Cap 3 followers with Spades suit complications). Alternatively, gain +2 dice to any roll involving resisting disease, poison, or necromantic effects, or step down one level of a Harm that is "undead" themed.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 5 Segments. CP often relate to "Spades" (harm, contagion, attracting undead attention) or "Hearts" (horror, desensitization, callousness).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Varn Karak's dominion expands. A full clock might mean the Warlock begins to emit a aura of death and decay (plants wither, food spoils), they attract the attention of a major undead entity who sees them as a rival or tool, or they must undergo a ritual that makes them partially undead (gaining benefits but also vulnerabilities).
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Whisper to Restless Spirits" (Cost: 6 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A small bone fragment held by the Thiasos, performed in a graveyard or place of death.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Gain +1 die to one Investigation or Lore roll involving recent deaths or burial sites. Alternatively, ask one yes/no question about a death that occurred within the last day in your current location.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 3 Segments. CP relate to "Spades" (minor harm, attracting minor undead attention) or "Hearts" (psychological strain, feeling death's presence).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Varn Karak's whispers grow louder. Minor attention might mean the Warlock feels slightly cold all the time or has trouble sleeping due to dreams of the dead.
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Awaken the Army of Bones" (Cost: 13 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A significant amount of bone material (graveyard soil, ossuary dust) blessed by the Thiasos in an extended ritual, the Warlock's blood mixed with grave dirt.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one extended conflict, you command an undead force equivalent to a Cap 5 follower with specialized undead abilities. This force can be sustained for the scene but requires constant concentration. Alternatively, gain +3 dice to any roll involving necromancy, death magic, or resisting death effects, and become immune to fear from undead creatures.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP relate to "Spades" (severe harm, attracting major undead attention, contagion) or "Hearts" (severe horror, complete desensitization, callousness to life).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Varn Karak claims his due. Major attention might mean the Warlock becomes a beacon for the dead (zombies follow them), they must regularly feed the dead with life force or souls, or they begin the transformation into a lich-like being under the Bone King's control.

*   **Mab ("She of the Thorned Crown") (Fae Trickster)**
*   **Flavor:** Queen of thorns and twilight bargains, Mab delights in turning promises inside-out and making sure everyone gets exactly what they asked for... but not what they wanted. She represents the wild, unpredictable magic of the fae and the price of dealing with the "Green Neighbors."
*   **Rite: "Bargain Beneath the Hawthorn" (Cost: 8 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A lock of hair from the Warlock woven into the Thiasos's fur/tail, a whispered promise spoken to the Codex.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Gain +2 dice to any Persuasion, Deceive, or Social maneuver for one scene, but you must phrase your intent in the form of a formal bargain or deal. The GM may grant an additional +1 die if the bargain is particularly clever or twisted. Alternatively, once per session, retroactively declare you made a prior bargain with an NPC present - they owe you a minor favor, but the GM determines what *they* gained from the deal.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 5 Segments. CP often relate to "Hearts" (betrayed trust, strained relationships, fae attention) or "Diamonds" (magical entanglements, literal interpretations of bargains).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Mab's gifts come with knots. A full clock might mean a previous bargain comes due in an inconvenient way, the Warlock finds themselves magically bound to serve a fae noble's whim, or their words begin carrying unintended magical weight (sarcasm becomes geas).
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Fae Fortune's Favor" (Cost: 6 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A four-leaf clover blessed by the Thiasos, performed under moonlight.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** You may re-roll one die showing 1 or 2 on any roll involving luck, chance, or social maneuvering. Alternatively, gain start Controlled on one action involving charm or deception if it's particularly whimsical or clever.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 3 Segments. CP relate to "Hearts" (minor social complications, attracting fae attention) or "Diamonds" (magical entanglements).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Mab's favor is fickle. Minor attention might mean the Warlock experiences slightly more good luck than usual but also slightly more bad luck, or they attract the attention of minor fae tricksters.
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Courtship with the Thorned Queen" (Cost: 12 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A gift of great personal value to the Warlock blessed by the Thiasos, performed at a crossroads during a fae-tide night.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one scene, you gain +2 dice to all social interactions and can force one NPC to generate CP of the Hearts suit if they oppose you directly. Additionally, you may declare one action as being "blessed by the Court" - it succeeds spectacularly but creates an equal and opposite consequence that will manifest later. Alternatively, gain immunity to all social deception and manipulation for the scene.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP relate to "Hearts" (major relationship complications, attracting powerful fae attention, becoming a figure of fae politics) or "Diamonds" (powerful magical entanglements, literal interpretations of actions).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Mab demands her due. Major attention might mean the Warlock becomes entangled in fae court politics as a pawn or potential consort, they attract the jealousy of other fae nobles, or they must regularly tithe significant favors to the fae courts.

*   **Nidhoggr, the World-Worm (Ancient Being/Corruptor)**
*   **Flavor:** An ancient, slumbering entity that dreams the world. Power drawn from its vast, incomprehensible subconscious. Nidhoggr represents the terrifying vastness of truly ancient powers and the alien nature of their dreams.
*   **Rite: "Drink from the Dreaming Deep" (Cost: 10 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Performing the Rite in complete darkness while the Thiasos whispers in an unknown tongue, a vial of water blessed by the Thiasos.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Gain knowledge of one secret or hidden thing (ask one specific, factual question about the current situation or a major plot element), but suffer Fatigue 1 and mark Exposure +1. Alternatively, gain +2 dice to any roll involving ancient lore, forbidden knowledge, or reality-warping effects.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP often relate to "Hearts" (psychological strain, alien dreams, madness) or "Diamonds" (reality instability, attracting the attention of other ancient entities).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Nidhoggr's dreams reshape reality. A full clock might mean the Warlock begins experiencing prophetic but disturbing visions, reality in their vicinity becomes unstable (spatial distortions, temporal echoes), or they inadvertently awaken a fragment of the World-Worm's consciousness.
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Glimpse the Ancient's Shadow" (Cost: 7 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Performing the Rite in twilight hours, a stone that has never seen sunlight blessed by the Thiasos.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Gain +1 die to one Investigation or Lore roll involving ancient history or forgotten places. Alternatively, you may sense the presence of ancient magical auras or significant historical sites within near range.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 4 Segments. CP relate to "Hearts" (minor psychological strain, alien thoughts) or "Diamonds" (minor reality instability).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Nidhoggr's shadow grows longer. Minor attention might mean the Warlock occasionally hears whispers in unknown languages or feels slightly dizzy in very old places.
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Dive into the World-Worm's Dreaming" (Cost: 14 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** Performing the Rite in complete isolation, the Thiasos entering a deep trance while touching the Warlock, who must fast for 24 hours prior.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one scene, you gain access to knowledge from across all of history and can ask the GM three specific, factual questions about any past event or hidden truth. However, you also suffer Fatigue 2 and mark Exposure +2. Alternatively, gain +3 dice to any roll involving reality-warping magic or ancient power, and you may downgrade any "Miss" result to "Success & Cost" once per scene.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 7 Segments. CP relate to "Hearts" (severe psychological trauma, madness, alien possession) or "Diamonds" (major reality instability, attracting the attention of other ancient entities with extreme prejudice).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Nidhoggr stirs in his sleep. Major attention might mean the Warlock becomes a permanent conduit for ancient dreams (uncontrollable visions), reality around them becomes increasingly unstable, or a fragment of the World-Worm's consciousness begins to share their mind.


*   **The Outsider (Extra-planar)**
*   **Flavor:** A being from beyond the known realms, its very presence warps reality. The Outsider represents the intrusion of alien geometries and the power that comes from accessing forces beyond normal understanding.
*   **Rite: "Step Sideways" (Cost: 10 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A mirror (however small) that has been cracked and repaired with silver wire by the Thiasos, a geometric pattern drawn in salt around the Warlock.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Treat the next zone you enter as having a favorable environmental aspect (e.g., cover, advantageous terrain, hidden exit) for one action. Alternatively, gain +2 dice to any roll involving extradimensional space, teleportation, or resisting planar effects.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP often relate to "Diamonds" (reality distortion, attracting otherworldly attention) or "Clubs" (planar instability, resources becoming "phase-shifted").
    *   **Patron Attention:** The Outsider's realm bleeds through. A full clock might mean a permanent spatial distortion appears near the Warlock (things are bigger on the inside, gravity shifts), they begin to partially exist in two places at once (causing confusion and vulnerability), or a planar entity manifests permanently in their vicinity, demanding tribute or service.
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Peek Through the Veil" (Cost: 7 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A small crystal shard blessed by the Thiasos, performed in an isolated location.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one roll, you may treat a penalty from environmental conditions or positioning as one step less severe. Alternatively, gain +1 die to any Investigation roll involving hidden planar influences or otherworldly auras.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 4 Segments. CP relate to "Diamonds" (minor reality distortion) or "Clubs" (minor planar instability).
    *   **Patron Attention:** The Outsider's gaze falls upon you. Minor attention might mean the Warlock occasionally sees slight distortions in reflections or shadows, or small objects phase in and out of existence near them.
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Tear the Fabric of Reality" (Cost: 14 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A mirror broken during the ritual, blessed with the Thiasos's blood, performed at a nexus of planar convergence.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one action, you may ignore all environmental penalties and positioning disadvantages. Additionally, you can create a temporary portal to a similar location within near range (GM's discretion on exact destination). Alternatively, gain +3 dice to any roll involving planar magic, teleportation, or reality manipulation, and become immune to non-magical environmental effects for the scene.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 7 Segments. CP relate to "Diamonds" (severe reality distortion, attracting powerful otherworldly attention) or "Clubs" (major planar instability, resources becoming permanently phase-shifted).
    *   **Patron Attention:** The Outsider's influence spreads. Major attention might mean a permanent rift to another plane opens near the Warlock, they begin to partially exist outside normal space-time (becoming intangible but also unable to interact normally), or they attract the attention of planar guardians who seek to close the breach they've created.


*   **Maelstreus, the Red Prince (Devil, Dealmaker/Temptor)**
*   **Flavor:** A master of infernal contracts and elegant corruption, Maelstreus offers power through carefully worded bargains that always favor him in the end. He represents the seductive nature of temptation and the precision of diabolical law.
*   **Rite: "Seal with Infernal Ink" (Cost: 9 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A contract written in the Warlock's blood on parchment prepared by the Thiasos, sealed with a drop of hellfire (represented by a red-hot iron).
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Choose one: add +2 effect to one action this scene, or gain start Controlled on one action this scene. However, you must mark one Condition (GM's choice, often Compromised, Indebted, or Tempted) that reflects the nature of your bargain. Alternatively, downgrade a "Miss" to a "Partial" or "Partial" to "Success & Cost" on a single roll.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 5 Segments. CP often relate to "Clubs" (resources owed, accumulating debt) or "Hearts" (moral compromise, attracting the attention of other infernal entities or righteous hunters).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Maelstreus calls in his due. A full clock might mean a previously signed contract's "fine print" becomes active, the Warlock finds themselves pursued by infernal bounty hunters or righteous inquisitors, or they must perform a significant service for the Red Prince that advances his long-term schemes.
*   **Low-Power Rite: "Whisper of the Red Court" (Cost: 6 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A small red candle blessed by the Thiasos, performed in private.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** Gain +1 die to one Persuasion or Deceive roll involving temptation or offering a deal. Alternatively, you may sense when someone nearby is considering a morally questionable action or deal.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 3 Segments. CP relate to "Clubs" (minor resources owed) or "Hearts" (minor moral compromise).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Maelstreus takes note. Minor attention might mean the Warlock feels slightly more persuasive when offering deals or feels a constant, mild temptation toward selfish actions.
*   **High-Stakes Rite: "Summon the Red Prince's Contract" (Cost: 13 XP)**
    *   **Materials:** A formal contract written in the Warlock's blood on infernal parchment, blessed by the Thiasos during a ritual at a crossroads at midnight.
    *   **Effect (Invoke - Boon):** For one scene, you may force one NPC to enter into a binding agreement with you - they must fulfill a significant request or suffer immediate supernatural consequences (Harm, Condition, etc.). Alternatively, gain +3 dice to all social manipulation involving deals, bargains, or temptation, and you may downgrade any "Miss" result to "Success & Cost" on social rolls.
    *   **Patron Obligation Clock:** 6 Segments. CP relate to "Clubs" (massive resources owed, accumulating infernal debt) or "Hearts" (severe moral compromise, attracting the attention of other infernal entities or righteous hunters with extreme prejudice).
    *   **Patron Attention:** Maelstreus demands his price. Major attention might mean the Warlock becomes a marked soul, attracting both infernal enforcers and righteous hunters, they must regularly tithe souls or life force to the Red Prince, or they begin to transform into a devil themselves under his guidance.
