\section{CREATING CUSTOM MONSTERS}

\subsection*{Threat Level Guidelines}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|X|}
\hline
\textbf{Level} & \textbf{Typical Harm} & \textbf{SB Generation} \\
\hline
Minor & Harm - or = & 1 SB per significant action \\
\hline
Moderate & Harm = or > & 1-2 SB per action \\
\hline
Major & Harm > or >> & 2-3 SB per action \\
\hline
Epic & Harm >> or † & 3-4+ SB per action \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Monster Design Template}

When creating custom creatures, consider these elements:

\textbf{Core Identity:}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is this creature's essential nature?
\item Where does it fit in the world's ecosystem?
\item What makes it unique or memorable?
\end{itemize}

\item What role does it serve in the story?
\item How does it challenge player assumptions?

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mechanical Balance:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Is its threat level appropriate for the PCs?
\item Do its abilities create interesting tactical choices?
\item Does it generate SB in thematically appropriate ways?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{SB Spending Philosophy}

Monsters should spend SB to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Escalate tension and stakes
\item Introduce new complications
\item Reflect their nature and motivations

\item Push the story forward
\end{itemize}

Avoid spending SB to:
\begin{itemize}

\item Ignore the fiction and creature's nature
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Mass Combat Creatures}

For large-scale battles, creatures can be grouped:

\begin{itemize}
\item Treat as single Cap 3 unit
\item Harm =, but can flank effectively
\item SB: 1 per 3 wolves lost, 2 for pack coordination
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Bandit Company (20-30 individuals):}

\item Specific creation rituals can shut them down
\item Vulnerable to anti-magic fields
\item Parts may be individually targetable
\end{itemize}

\section{ECOSYSTEM INTERACTIONS}

\subsection*{Predator-Prey Relationships}

Understanding how creatures interact helps create realistic encounters:

\textbf{Blackwood Wolves} hunt \textbf{Dire Boars} but avoid \textbf{Mist Wraiths}

\textbf{Bandit Skirmishers} prey on \textbf{Merchants} but fear \textbf{Ykrul Raiders}

\textbf{Deep Drakes} compete with \textbf{Stone Giant Elders} for territory

\textbf{Redcaps} manipulate \textbf{Bandits} but cannot control \textbf{Curse Echoes}

\subsection*{Seasonal Variations}

Creature behavior changes with seasons:

\textbf{Spring}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dire Boars more aggressive (mating season)
\item Bandit activity increases (roads clear)
\item Mist Wraiths less common (less fog)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Summer}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ykrul Raiders more active (good weather for raids)
\item Blackwood Wolves hunt at night (avoid heat)
\item Shadow Stalkers weaker (more daylight)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Autumn}:
\begin{itemize}
\item All predators more dangerous (winter preparation)
\item Curse activity increases (approaching dark season)
\item Bandit raids become desperate (harvest time)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Winter}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Creatures cluster around resources
\item Supernatural activity peaks
\item Survival becomes primary motivation
\end{itemize}

\section{MONSTER LORE AND BACKGROUND}

\subsection*{Creating Monster Histories}

Every monster should have a story:

\textbf{Origin}: How did this creature come to be?
\begin{itemize}
\item Natural evolution
\item Magical experimentation
\item Curse transformation
\item Ancient remnant
\item Imported from elsewhere
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Current State}: What drives this creature now?
\begin{itemize}
\item Survival instinct
\item Unfinished business
\item Obedience to master
\item Territorial defense
\item Hunger for specific thing
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Future Potential}: What could change this creature?
\begin{itemize}
\item Redemption/defeat of master
\item Environmental change
\item Player intervention
\item Natural cycle completion
\item Magical evolution
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Sample Monster Backstory}

\textbf{The Weeping Knight} - Mist Wraith

Once Sir Aldric Brightshield, a champion of Ecktoria who died defending refugees during a Ykrul raid. His body was never recovered from the Mistlands, and his spirit, unable to accept death, became bound to his armor. Now he endlessly reenacts his final stand, protecting anyone who matches the refugees he failed to save.

\textbf{Current Motivation}: Protect the innocent, especially children and families

\textbf{Weakness}: His vow to protect refugees can be fulfilled by players who take up that cause

\textbf{Potential Growth}: Could become an ally if PCs honor his sacrifice appropriately

\section{ENCOUNTER DESIGN TIPS}

\subsection*{Building Tension}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Foreshadowing}: Drop hints before the encounter
\item \textbf{Escalation}: Start simple, add complications
\item \textbf{Stakes}: Make it clear what's at risk
\item \textbf{Choices}: Give players meaningful options
\item \textbf{Pacing}: Vary action and dialogue
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Balancing Challenge}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Threat Assessment}: Match monster power to PC capabilities
\item \textbf{Environmental Factors}: Consider terrain and circumstances
\item \textbf{Resource Management}: Account for PC resources (Boons, Fatigue, Gear)
\item \textbf{Fallback Options}: Plan for different player approaches
\item \textbf{Consequence Variety}: Not every encounter needs combat
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Narrative Integration}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Campaign Connections}: Link to ongoing storylines
\item \textbf{Character Development}: Provide growth opportunities
\item \textbf{World Building}: Reveal setting details
\item \textbf{Thematic Reinforcement}: Support campaign themes
\item \textbf{Future Hooks}: Create seeds for later encounters
\end{itemize}
