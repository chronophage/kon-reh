\section*{Profile}
\textbf{Name:} Saikou Ira\\
\textbf{Concept:} Kahfagian Marine Captain turned Supernatural Investigator\\
\textbf{Tier:} II (68 XP)\\
\textbf{Current XP:} 68\\
\textbf{Affiliation:} Kahfagian Navy, The Witness (Primary Patron), The Empty Temple\\
\textbf{Familiar:} Nyx, black cat spirit — bound through the Mirror Rite of The Witness\\[6pt]
\emph{Main Patron: The Witness, Keeper of the Unblinking Truth.} Its symbol is a silver mirror set in black obsidian, ever clear of dust or reflection save that of deceit. Those who serve The Witness walk a razor’s edge between revelation and ruin, as every truth uncovered exacts its price in innocence lost.

\section*{Attributes}
Body 2 — Disciplined but scarred\\
Wits 4 — Tactical intellect, forensic insight\\
Spirit 3 — Steeled will, supernatural focus\\
Presence 3 — Commanding voice, analytical calm

\section*{Skills}
Investigation 4; Arcana 3; Command 2; Sway 3; Lore 2; Melee 2

\section*{Talents}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Caster’s Gift} — Freeform ritual casting guided by The Witness.
  \item \textbf{Thiasos (Nyx)} — Familiar; incorporeal scout linked through mirror bond.
  \item \textbf{Codex} — The Witness’ Runekeeper compendium: each rune a truth etched in reflection.
  \item \textbf{Patron’s Symbols} — Divination (Truth), Abjuration (Wards), Exorcism (Banishment), Kahfagian Heritage (Raéyn’s favor).
  \item \textbf{Lorekeeper} — Recall obscure knowledge without rolling; The Witness whispers forgotten details.
  \item \textbf{Exceptional Coordination} — One follower provides +4 Assist dice.
  \item \textbf{Iron Stomach} — Immune to mundane toxins; truth cannot be poisoned.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rites:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Rite of the Lingering Glimpse (Low)} — Preserve a fading truth long enough to analyze; requires a reflective surface.
  \item \textbf{Rite of Piercing Scrutiny (Low)} — Read falsehood from the eyes or aura of a speaker.
  \item \textbf{Rite of the Echoing Truth (Standard)} — Manifest spoken truths as visible runes that linger briefly.
  \item \textbf{Rite of the Immutable Record (Standard)} — Inscribe an event into mirror or lens; cannot be erased.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Sidebar: Investigation Techniques}
\emph{Field-tested methods Saikou favors; each is a small, repeatable loop that plugs into SRD actions and Boon economy.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Canré Method (3 Moves Ahead):} Frame three hypotheses, then play them like opening lines. Each scene, “sacrifice” one assumption to learn a forcing truth. Spend 1 Boon to reposition socially after a risky reveal.
  \item \textbf{Lantern Pier Routine:} Document \emph{smell, sound, light, line} before touching evidence. On a later roll, recall one sensory hook to gain +1 die (once per case).
  \item \textbf{Evidence Ladder:} Always convert one clue into an \emph{asset}: map-pin, oath, or witness favor. Clocks tick slower when the team owns leverage.
  \item \textbf{Ritual Forensics:} Pair The Witness + Sealed Gate: read, then lock. First reveal a pattern, then preserve the site; treat contamination attempts as Desperate.
  \item \textbf{Interview Triangulation:} Three short talks beat one long one. Ask a factual, a motive, and a memory question in separate locales; contradictions create actionable leads.
  \item \textbf{Harbor Net (Kahfagia):} Activate Blackwater Network at shift change; rumors move with the tide. Spend 1 Boon to “buy the tide” for quiet access to restricted quays.
  \item \textbf{Shadow Walk:} Trail without tailing—move one block ahead, predict choices with Traveler rites. On a success, place a Waymark that grants +1 die to the next ambush or parley.
  \item \textbf{Scene Reset:} When the board clutters, clear the room, sketch only vectors (who wants what from whom). Reduce Community panic by one if aired in public.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Sidebar: Patron Interaction Reference}
\emph{Using multiple Patrons in a scene is powerful but noisy. Use this quick reference to time invocations and manage interference without a table.}

\subsection*{The Witness — Truth/Revelation}
\textbf{When to Invoke:} First pass on a scene; deciding what’s actually present.\\
\textbf{Typical Boon Spend:} 1 Boon to stabilize a fragile vision so it persists into the next scene.\\
\textbf{Interference Sign:} Mirrors film over; Nyx’s pupils pin.\\
\textbf{Compel/Whisper:} “Ask the question that costs a friend.”\\
\textbf{Overuse Cost:} You become exacting and cold (–1 die to warmth/comfort until rest).\\
\textbf{Synergy:} Pairs with Sealed Gate—reveal, then sanctify.

\subsection*{The Sealed Gate — Boundaries/Closure}
\textbf{When to Invoke:} Any time harm spreads: contagion, panic, spirits.\\
\textbf{Typical Boon Spend:} 1 Boon to anchor a ward to a \emph{name} instead of a place.\\
\textbf{Interference Sign:} Keys feel heavy; doors refuse to open twice.\\
\textbf{Compel/Whisper:} “Close it before understanding it.”\\
\textbf{Overuse Cost:} Collateral isolation (an ally or witness is shut out).\\
\textbf{Synergy:} Follows Traveler—funnel a pursuit into a chosen corridor.

\subsection*{Raéyn — Storms/Tides}
\textbf{When to Invoke:} Crowd control, maritime leads, momentum swings.\\
\textbf{Typical Boon Spend:} 1 Boon to treat a moving crowd like current: reposition the team 1 cell/hex without provoking.\\
\textbf{Interference Sign:} Salt on the tongue; floor tilts imperceptibly.\\
\textbf{Compel/Whisper:} “Answer insult with force.”\\
\textbf{Overuse Cost:} Tempers flare; your next parley begins at a worse position.\\
\textbf{Synergy:} With Witness—carry revealed truth through a hostile room.

\subsection*{The Traveler — Ways/Roads}
\textbf{When to Invoke:} Tails, escapes, link-analysis, pattern pursuit.\\
\textbf{Typical Boon Spend:} 1 Boon to convert a sketched Waymark into a temporary safe route (ignore ZOC once along that line).\\
\textbf{Interference Sign:} Footsteps misalign; maps smudge at the margins.\\
\textbf{Compel/Whisper:} “Move now; ask later.”\\
\textbf{Overuse Cost:} Dislocated timing—one ally arrives a scene late.\\
\textbf{Synergy:} Precedes Sealed Gate—herd, then lock.

\bigskip
\noindent\emph{GM Note:} If two or more Patrons are invoked in the same exchange, consider rolling the \textit{Patronal Conflict Track}. On interference, fold in one sign above and complicate without negating success.
