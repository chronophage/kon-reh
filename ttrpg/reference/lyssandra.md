Lyssandra, the Cupbearer’s Mad Cantor

Tier III Monk / Cantor of Thrysos

Core Concept

A once-disciplined monastic singer who embraced Thrysos, the Cupbearer. Through Cantor’s Path, she stole rites she was never meant to wield — and drank too deeply of divine intoxication. Now she staggers, sings, and laughs her way through battle, untouchable as spilled wine on marble.

	•	Wits: 2
	•	Spirit: 4

Talents
	•	Unarmored Mastery – Gain armor 1 while unarmored and unencumbered.
	•	Fluid Motion – When unarmored, always act as if in Dominant Position for movement/acrobatics.
	•	Perfect Stance (Tier III) – Once per session, negate a hit entirely. (Narrative: “Too drunk to be touched.” She stumbles out of harm’s way at the last possible moment.)
	•	Embraced Corruption (Stage 2 Talent) – Her corruption is no longer a penalty but a focus of power. Gains +1 die when acting in a way aligned with her corruption’s nature (compulsion toward ecstatic abandon, destructive joy, and wine-fed madness).

⸻

Cantor’s Path
	•	May mimic and channel Patron rites without Thiasos or Codex.
	•	Every use risks corruption.
	•	Corruption track (current: Stage 2, embraced as Talent).

Rites Known

(all accessed via Cantor’s Path, flavored as drunken chants, shattered hymns, and ecstatic dances)
	•	Thrysos — Cup Overflowing (Low Rite): Create communal intoxication. Allies gain +1 die to Spirit or Presence rolls this scene, but also risk reckless action.
	•	Thrysos — Laughing Collapse (Low Rite): Cause foes to stagger in drunken mirth. Target loses Dominant Position until they recover.
	•	Traveller — Swift Road (Low Rite): Move instantly across a short distance, as though staggering but arriving where needed.
	•	Aveh — Wings of the Dawn (Low Rite): Leap impossible distances or run across surfaces briefly.

⸻

Flaws / Maínomai

Lyssandra is marked by ecstatic madness. She:
	•	Cannot resist a toast or shared drink.
	•	Speaks truths in riddling songs when drunk, often revealing secrets she shouldn’t know.
	•	Laughs at violence, interpreting it as another form of divine dance.

⸻

Gear
	•	Monk’s wraps (treated as unarmed, counts as enchanted through Patron’s corruption).
	•	Drinking gourd (focus for her Cantor’s Path).
	•	Bells and cords tied to her sash.

⸻

Play Style
	•	Battlefield Control: Uses drunken staggering + Fluid Motion to stay in Dominant Position.
	•	Survivability: Perfect Stance lets her “luck” out of one deadly strike per session.
	•	Corruption Power: Gains dice when she indulges her maenad side — whether by reckless charge, joyful destruction, or drunken ritual.
	•	Mobility: Traveller + Aveh rites let her stagger-step through space, leaping and weaving with uncatchable grace.
