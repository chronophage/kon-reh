\region{Acasia - Broken Marches}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

Acasia rots between famine and ambition. Every hill wears a crown, every bridge bears a toll, and every road curves back to cursed crossroads. Where once the Empire's coin and grain flowed, now tithe-collectors gnaw the marrow of starving villages, and warlords dress themselves as kings.

As someone from Acasia, you know the weight of survival. Every meal is a victory, every safe night a miracle. You've learned to read the subtle signs of betrayal in a neighbor's eye, to distinguish between the honest poor and those who prey on them. The land itself seems cursed, roads that should lead somewhere instead bring you back to where you started, and the bells of abandoned churches toll for no funeral.

You've seen kingdoms rise and fall in a season. Loyalty is a luxury you can't afford, but neither is complete cynicism - someone must tend the fields, someone must remember the old ways. You are simultaneously hardened by hardship and haunted by what you've lost.

\columnbreak

\subregion{Background Ideas}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Tithe Runner:} You carry tallies between villages and overlords, learning the price of survival.
    \item \textbf{Road Prior:} You guard relics and offer sanctuary to travelers in a land where both are rare.
    \item \textbf{Blackwood Keeper:} You tend ancient forests that remember when the land was whole.
    \item \textbf{Free Captain:} You lead a band of sellswords, selling your loyalty to the highest bidder.
    \item \textbf{Margrave's Hand:} You serve one of the few true powers in a land of pretenders.
\end{itemize}

\subregion{Regional Talent}

\textbf{Rot-Sense} (Acasia Affinity)
You can sense the curse that permeates Acasia. When you encounter a person, place, or object affected by the curse, you can immediately tell if it's genuine or a manifestation of the land's corruption. This ability also grants you +1 die to resist curse-related effects, as you understand their nature intimately.

\region{Aelaerem - Hearth \& Hollow}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

The Aelaerem keep their bargains with bread, bells, and careful counting. Lanes run under ash and hawthorn; doors reddened with thread promise a seat and a story to any who step right. Their magic is housekeeping writ large—tidings tended, names jarred like jam, thresholds groomed so the Neighbors pass by without offense.

Life among the Aelaerem is one of quiet rhythms and deep traditions. You wake to the sound of geese, tend gardens that know their own minds, and speak to neighbors over carefully maintained hedges. Every action has its proper time and manner. You know that leaving butter at cup-marks keeps certain visitors satisfied, that counting "eight-and-one" instead of nine keeps the Hollow from noticing, and that the right song at the right moment can turn away disaster.

You are part of a community that remembers everything and forgives little. Hospitality is sacred, but so are boundaries. You've learned to read the subtle language of red threads, watchful bells, and the particular way shadows fall in your village.

\columnbreak

\textbf{Hearth Magic} (Aelaerem Affinity)
You can perform small magics of hospitality and home. Once per scene, you can ensure that a guest feels welcome and safe in your presence (granting them +1 die to resist fear or social pressure), or you can sense when someone approaches with harmful intent (+1 die to Notice rolls against potential threats). These abilities require no formal casting but draw on the deep traditions of hearth and home.

\end{multicols}

\region{Aeler - Crowns \& Under-Vaults}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

The Aeler hold the mountains by breath, bell, and bargain. Their halls run like arteries, their cities open in thunderous caverns where bridges leap between ribs of stone and cisterns shine like night skies turned inward. Survival is the first law: air is counted, water is barned, light is rationed by wick and prayer.

You live in a world of precise measurements and ancient traditions. Every breath matters, every word is weighed, and every action must be justified to the collective. You've learned to navigate by bell-codes and read the subtle signs of air quality. The mountain itself is alive to you - you can sense when passages shift, when the stone holds tension, and when the deep places stir.

Your society values expertise above all else. Whether you're a lamplighter, an engineer, or a vault-keeper, you are part of a precise mechanism that keeps your people alive. You understand the weight of responsibility and the importance of keeping your word. The mountain remembers everything, and so do you.

\region{Aelinnel - Stone, Bough, and Bright Things}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

Aelinnel clings to the Dolmis coast beneath the shadow of the Valewood, its halls threaded through granite and hawthorn, its roads counted by antler-posts and moonlit math. Here, promises have weight and numbers have manners. Even steps are safe, odd words are careful, and truths are traded like copper nails—bright, useful, slightly dangerous in the wrong pocket.

You live in a world where precision and magic intertwine. Every path has its proper number, every word its exact meaning, and every action its correct form. You've learned to read the language of antler-posts, to distinguish between honest merchants and those who deal in half-truths, and to navigate by the particular way moonlight falls on familiar stones.

Your society values both craft and courtesy. You understand that a well-made object carries the maker's intention, and that proper behavior opens doors that force cannot. The fae courts that neighbor your realm demand exactitude in all things, and you've learned to meet their standards while maintaining your own identity.

\columnbreak

\subregion{Background Ideas}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Stone-Singer:} You can coax secrets from rock and shape it with your voice.

Additionally, you gain +1 die to any rolls involving precise work, navigation, or detecting subtle inconsistencies. Numbers and patterns speak to you with unusual clarity.

\end{multicols}

\region{Black Banners - Condotta \& Crowns}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

Ecktorian treasuries bankroll a perpetual border-war they claim to be containing. In truth, the gold keeps the fire burning. The Black Banners are mercenary leagues—ex-Utaran legionaries, second-sons, debt-dodgers, and exiles—who sell steel to the highest bidder, today's ally becoming tomorrow's quarry.

You live by the sword and die by the contract. Every morning you wake not knowing if today will bring pay or battle, allies or enemies. You've learned to read the subtle signs of betrayal in a captain's eye, to distinguish between honest coin and payment that comes with strings attached, and to find comfort in the company of those who understand your chosen path.

Your world is one of shifting loyalties and temporary allegiances. You know that the strongest bond is the one between soldiers who've faced death together, and that the only constant is change. You've seen kingdoms rise and fall based on the movement of mercenary companies, and you understand that gold speaks louder than oaths.

\columnbreak

\subregion{Background Ideas}

\end{multicols}

\region{Ecktoria - Marble \& Fire}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

Once the heart of the Utaran Empire, Ecktoria has worn its laurels into chains. Three centuries of sack, fire, and slow decline have not stripped its marble forums nor its gold-sealed coin-houses—but each day, more of its wealth slips into the hands of mercenaries and factions.

You live among the ruins of glory, in a city that remembers when it ruled the world. Every street corner holds a monument to past triumph, every building a testament to former grandeur. You've learned to navigate the complex web of competing factions, to distinguish between genuine authority and empty titles, and to find opportunity in the gaps between what was and what is.

Your society is one of elaborate ceremony and hidden desperation. The processions still crown the stairways, but the gold that pays for them comes from increasingly questionable sources. You understand the weight of legacy and the difficulty of living up to it, while also recognizing the necessity of adaptation.

\columnbreak

\subregion{Background Ideas}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Coin-House Factor:} You manage the complex financial instruments that keep the city functioning.

Additionally, you gain +1 die to any social rolls involving educated elites or bureaucratic manipulation. The weight of empire's wisdom rests in your mind.

\end{multicols}

\region{Linn - Skerries \& Storm-Oaths}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

North of the Aberderrin Sea, where fjords split the coast and skerries break the tide, dwell the Linn. They are traders and raiders in equal breath, their longships crowding the whale-road and river mouths. They descend the Ylolka like an axe-blade and cut into southern shores, or slip through the Thin Strip where the Valewood dares not touch salt.

You live by the rhythm of tide and storm. Every decision is measured against the weather, every journey planned around the movement of currents and wind. You've learned to read the signs in the sky and sea, to distinguish between honest traders and those who would take what isn't freely given, and to find your way in a world where the only constant is change.

Your society values both independence and loyalty. You understand the importance of keeping your word while also recognizing when circumstances require flexibility. The sea is your teacher and your judge, and you've learned to respect its power while using your skills to thrive in its domain.

\columnbreak

\subregion{Background Ideas}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Net-Wife:} You read the sea like a ledger and the sky like a mood ring.

You can sense the moods and movements of the sea.

Additionally, you gain +1 die to any rolls involving maritime activities, weather prediction, or survival at sea. The ocean speaks to you in a language of waves and wind.

\end{multicols}

\region{Mistlands - Bells, Salt, and Breath}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

The Mistlands lie north of the Aelerian mountains, where the Aberderrin Sea laps against reed-fens and drowned shores. It is a Protectorate of the Aeler, but their iron passes only hold the southern roads—the land itself belongs to fog and bells.

You live in a world where the boundary between the living and dead is thin, where every levee hums with protective magic, and where the simple act of breathing can be a political statement. You've learned to navigate by the sound of bells, to distinguish between helpful spirits and malevolent ones, and to find your way in a landscape that shifts with the mist.

Your society is one of careful observance and precise ritual. Every action has its proper form, every word its correct weight. You understand the importance of salt as both protection and promise, and you've learned to read the subtle signs that indicate when the boundaries between worlds grow thin.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]

You can sense the presence and strength of magical wards and protective barriers. When you encounter a warded area, you can immediately tell if it's active, how strong it is, and what type of threat it's designed to repel. Additionally, you gain +1 die to any rolls involving the creation, maintenance, or bypassing of magical protections. The boundary between safe and dangerous spaces is clear to you.

\end{multicols}

\region{Silkstrand - City of Bridges \& Dyewater}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

Silkstrand is a city strung across canals and arches, a place where every bridge is a ledger line and every current carries rumor. The dyes that stain its waters never wash out, and neither do the bargains struck in shadow.

You live in a world of constant negotiation and careful alliance. Every interaction is a potential business deal, every relationship a possible partnership or rivalry. You've learned to read the subtle signs of social positioning, to distinguish between genuine opportunities and clever traps, and to navigate the complex web of guilds, factors, and condottieri that rule your city.

Your society values both wealth and wit. You understand that money speaks, but so do connections and reputation. The bridges of Silkstrand are more than architectural marvels—they're symbols of the connections that make or break fortunes in your world.

\end{multicols}

\region{Theona - Three Greens, No Ninth}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

The isles of Theona rise green and jagged from the Dolmis, their basalt cliffs wrapped in mists and moorland song. Nominally a duchy sworn to Viterra, in truth the Three Greens heed no crown but their own moots, no law but their taboos.

You live in a world where tradition weighs heavier than law, where the unspoken rules are more binding than written ones. You've learned to navigate by the subtle signs of social approval, to distinguish between harmless custom and dangerous taboo, and to find your way in a society where the number nine is never spoken aloud.

Your society values consensus and careful observance. You understand that breaking custom can be more dangerous than breaking law, and that the old ways exist for good reason. The mists that surround your islands are not just weather—they're a barrier between your world and one that doesn't understand your careful balance.

\region{Thepyrgos - City of a Thousand Stairs}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

Thepyrgos is both realm and city, a former province whose capital rises in tiers of towers, terraces, and endless stairs above the Dolmis shore. Once an Utar bastion, now a nation unto itself, it is famed for its universities, libraries, and debating synods.

You live in a world where knowledge is power and height is hierarchy. Every stair climbed brings you closer to authority, every debate won grants you influence. You've learned to navigate the complex social hierarchies that govern your city, to distinguish between genuine expertise and empty rhetoric, and to find opportunity in the endless flow of information that characterizes your society.

Your society values education and precise argument. You understand that the right word at the right time can change the world, and that knowledge properly applied is the most powerful tool available. The towers of Thepyrgos are not just architectural marvels—they're symbols of the intellectual ascent that defines your culture.

\end{multicols}

\region{Ubral - The Stone Between Spears}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

Ubral is a land of upland mists, stone cairns, and clan oaths held tighter than iron. Caught between the Aelerian mountains and the lowland courts of Viterra, its hills are scarred by old raids and crowned by watch-fires that speak faster than any rider.

You live in a world where honor is everything and hospitality is sacred. Every guest-right must be honored, every oath kept, and every slight remembered. You've learned to read the subtle signs of clan politics, to distinguish between genuine friendship and temporary alliance, and to navigate the complex web of obligations that bind your society together.

Your society values personal honor and collective memory. You understand that a single broken promise can spark a feud that lasts generations, and that the right word at the right time can prevent disaster. The stone cairns that mark your landscape are not just navigation aids—they're monuments to the weight of keeping one's word.

Additionally, you gain +1 die to any rolls involving negotiation, social pressure, or maintaining your own honor. The weight of your word shapes reality around you.

\end{multicols}

\region{Valewood - Empire Under Leaves}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

The Valewood is older than kingdoms, older than the maps that skirt its borders. Beneath its canopy lie the bones of a Lethai empire whose name is forgotten, its towers swallowed by vine and root, its star-roads cracked and phasing between worlds.

You live in a world where the boundary between past and present is thin, where ancient magic still flows through the landscape, and where the very trees remember secrets that died with their speakers. You've learned to navigate by signs that others miss, to distinguish between helpful spirits and dangerous ones, and to find your way in a forest that actively resists those who would exploit it.

Your society values the old ways and the careful balance between guest and host. You understand that the forest responds to respect and punishes greed, and that the right offering at the right shrine can open paths that remain closed to others. The ruins you encounter are not just archaeological curiosities—they're active participants in the ongoing story of your world.

\region{Vhasia - The Fractured Sun}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

Vhasia is a realm of broken coronations and split loyalties. Once a proud province of the Utar empire, the unified Sun-court shattered like its heraldic sunburst, leaving rival dukes, abbesses, and parlements to claim the light.

You live in a world where legitimacy is fragile and alliances shift like shadows. Every oath risks breaking along fault lines of politics, faith, and fortune. You've learned to navigate the complex web of competing claims, to distinguish between genuine authority and empty titles, and to find opportunity in the gaps between what various powers claim.

Your society values adaptability and careful positioning. You understand that today's ally may be tomorrow's enemy, and that the smart survivor keeps options open. The chipped sun-discs on milestones are not just vandalism—they're symbols of a world where nothing can be taken for granted.

\region{Vilikari - Laurels \& Longhouses}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

The Vilikari are the agrarian peoples straddling the frontiers of Acasia and Viterra, tillers and treaty-makers who balance survival between empire, steppe, and sea. In a three-way war with the Ykrul and the Black Banners, they live by the cleverness of their diplomacy, the leverage of their markets, and the shifting weight of oaths.

You live in a world where survival depends on careful balance and precise timing. Every treaty must be negotiated with multiple parties, every trade deal must account for shifting political winds, and every alliance must be constantly tended. You've learned to read the subtle signs of diplomatic tension, to distinguish between genuine friendship and temporary convenience, and to find opportunity in the complex web of relationships that define your borderlands.

Your society values both strength and subtlety. You understand that force alone cannot hold your position, but neither can diplomacy without the threat of violence behind it. The longhouses of your people are not just dwellings—they're symbols of the collective strength that comes from unity in diversity.

\region{Viterra - The Hedge-Law Realm}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subregion{What It's Like}

Viterra is a kingdom bound less by steel than by precedent, its borders traced in hedgerows, dikes, and river-rights. Once a proud kingdom before being conquered by the Utar empire, Viterra has reclaimed its identity after 300 years of foreign rule.

You live in a world where law is both shield and spear, and where the weight of a charter may outweigh the blade of a sword. Every boundary is carefully maintained, every right jealously guarded, and every precedent meticulously recorded.
