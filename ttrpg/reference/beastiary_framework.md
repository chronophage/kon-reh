# Fate's Edge Beastiary Framework

## Core Beastiary Philosophy

In Fate's Edge, creatures are not just stat blocks—they're narrative elements that serve the story. Each creature should:
- Advance the fiction through meaningful consequences
- Reflect the themes of their region/origin
- Create interesting tactical and social choices
- Generate Story Beats that enhance rather than punish player agency

## Beast Creation Guidelines

### Tier Ratings
- **Tier 1 (Cap 1):** Minor threats, easily handled by most characters
- **Tier 2 (Cap 2):** Standard encounters, require attention but not extreme tactics
- **Tier 3 (Cap 3):** Significant threats, can challenge veteran parties
- **Tier 4 (Cap 4):** Major threats, require coordinated efforts and planning
- **Tier 5 (Cap 5):** Epic threats, campaign-defining encounters

### Element Integration
Each creature should have a primary element that influences:
- Their appearance and abilities
- Their weaknesses and resistances
- The type of Story Beats they generate
- Their cultural significance

### Regional Flavor
Creatures should reflect their home region's themes:
- **Acasia:** Curses, feuds, broken promises
- **Aelaerem:** Hearth magic, hospitality, seasonal cycles
- **Aeler:** Precision, tradition, underground spaces
- **Mistlands:** Death, boundaries, salt and bells
- **Valewood:** Ancient empire, fae magic, transformation
- **Ways Between:** Thresholds, liminality, path magic

### Narrative Integration
Every creature should offer:
- Multiple ways to deal with them (combat, social, ritual)
- Story Beats that enhance rather than punish player creativity
- Rewards that tie into the broader campaign themes
- Relationships with factions and other creatures

This framework allows for creatures that serve the narrative while providing tactical variety and meaningful choices for players.
