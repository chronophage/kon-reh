Absolutely. This is the crucial bridge from "understanding the rules" to "running the game fluidly." The SRD provides the tools, but let's boil them down into a **GM's Quick-Kit for On-The-Fly Decisions.**

Here’s what can help, framed as actionable advice and cheat sheets.

### 1. The 5-Second Position & Effect Decider

Stop overthinking. Ask these two questions in order:

**A) What's the RISK?** (This sets **Position**)
*   **Dominant:** Is the character safe, prepared, or in charge? → "No big risk."
*   **Controlled:** (DEFAULT) Is there some pressure, danger, or uncertainty? → "Standard risk."
*   **Desperate:** Is the character in immediate, severe danger or over their head? → "High risk."

**B) What's the IMPACT?** (This sets **Effect**)
*   **Limited:** Will this only partially solve the problem or have a minor effect? → "Small impact."
*   **Standard:** (DEFAULT) Will this do about what you'd expect? → "Standard impact."
*   **Great:** Will this have a major, overwhelming, or extra-effective result? → "Big impact."

**The Flowchart in Practice:**
Player: "I kick down the door and charge the cultist!"
GM: *("Risk? Charging in is pretty standard danger... Controlled. Impact? Knocking down a door and attacking is standard... Standard. Got it.")*
"Controlled/Standard. Roll."

Player: "I sneak up behind the cultist while he's chanting and slit his throat."
GM: *("Risk? If he turns around, you're exposed... that's Controlled or even Desperate. Impact? A stealth kill from behind is a huge impact... Great.")*
"Desperate/Great. Roll."

### 2. The Lazy GM's DV Chart (Stick This On Your Screen)

Don't calculate. Just pick from this menu based on the *narrative weight*.

| DV | When to Use It (The Vibe) | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2** | **Routine.** Low stakes, clear intent, no pressure. | Picking a lock in your hideout. |
| **3** | **Pressured.** (DEFAULT) Time pressure, mild resistance, partial info. | Picking that lock while guards are in the next room. |
| **4** | **Hard.** Hostile conditions, active opposition, high precision needed. | Picking the lock on a chest that's rigged to a trap. |
| **5+** | **Extreme.** Nearly impossible, multiple severe constraints, dramatic failure. | Picking a magical lock, underwater, while holding your breath. |

**Your Mantra:** "If in doubt, it's DV 3."

### 3. The "No-Thinking" SB Spend Menu

When a player rolls a 1, don't plan. React. Pick ONE thing from this list. One and done.

*   **Spend 1 SB:** Introduce a **Minor Complication**.
    *   *"You make a loud noise."*
    *   *"You leave behind a clue."*
    *   *"You use up a resource."*
    *   *"A minor enemy arrives."*
    *   **Tick a Clock +1.**

*   **Spend 2 SB:** Introduce a **Moderate Complication**.
    *   *"An alarm is raised."*
    *   *"You lose your advantageous position (Dominant -> Controlled)."*
    *   *"A key piece of gear breaks or is lost."*
    *   *"A more significant enemy appears."*
    *   **Tick a Clock +2.**

*   **Spend 3+ SB:** Introduce a **Major Complication**.
    *   *"Reinforcements swarm the area."*
    *   *"The environment shifts dangerously (fire, collapse)."*
    *   *"A new, major threat is revealed."*
    *   *"An ally is put in immediate danger."*
    *   **Fill 3+ segments of a Clock.**

### 4. The "Three-Clock Rule"

You cannot manage ten clocks at once. You just can't. So, don't.

**Only ever have 3 "active" clocks at a time.**
*   One for the **Scene** (e.g., Guards Alerted [4])
*   One for the **Journey** (e.g., Travel to the Keep [6])
*   One for the **Campaign** (e.g., The Baron's Mistrust [8])

If a new complication arises that needs a clock, see if it can be folded into an existing one. "The bridge is collapsing" can just be a tick on the "Travel" clock. This forces you to be efficient and keeps the game focused.

### 5. The Magic Adjudication Shortcut

A player wants to do something magical and freeform you didn't expect.
1.  **Listen to their intent.**
2.  **Assign it a TAG from the library** (e.g., it sounds like a `[VEIL]` or a `[WARD]`).
3.  **Use the standard DV for that TAG's "power level."**
    *   Low/Personal Effect: **DV 2**
    *   Standard/Scene Effect: **DV 3**
    *   High/Area Effect: **DV 4**
4.  Set **Position** based on how exposed/distracted they are while casting.

You don't need to invent a new spell. You just need to classify it. "You're creating a wall of force? That's a `[BARRIER]` with a Standard/Scene effect. You're in melee, so that's a **Risky** cast. **DV 3.** Roll."

### The Ultimate Mindset Hack

**You are not a computer processing rules. You are a film director describing the next shot.**

When a roll happens, you are simply deciding: "Is this the scene where the hero gets a clean win, a costly win, a partial victory, or where things go to hell?"

The mechanics are just your camera, your script, and your special effects budget. Use these quick-kit tools to make your directorial decisions fast and confident, so you can keep the story rolling.
