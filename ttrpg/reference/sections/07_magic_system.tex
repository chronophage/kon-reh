\label{chap:magic-system}

\section{Design Philosophy}
\label{sec:magic-philosophy}

Magic in \textbf{Fate's Edge} is a dangerous negotiation with the fabric of reality. It is powerful and flexible—yet every attempt to shape it carries risk. Each die showing \textbf{1} generates \textbf{Story Beats (SB)}, which are prompts for twists and complications. The fiction leads; math follows.

\section{The Four Paths of Magic}
\label{sec:four-paths}

\subsection{Casting (Freeform Magic)}
\label{subsec:freeform-casting}

Freeform casting represents raw, improvisational magic.

\begin{description}
\item[Requirement] \textbf{Caster's Gift} Talent (2 XP).
\item[Mechanics] Two-step \emph{Weave \& Cast} colored by the Eight Elements; fiction-first targets and scope.
\item[Risk] Each 1 generates SB; DV scales with scope; backlash is expressed by Element (or its opposite).
\item[Limits] Heavy control effects (e.g., \texttt{[WARD]}, \texttt{[BANISH]}, \texttt{[UNWARD]}) require a printed source (Talent, \emph{Rite} text, or Spell result).
\end{description}

\subsection*{GM Guidance}\label{subsec:backlash-gm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Show, then Nudge.} Lead with the fiction (smoke, fissures, whispers), then apply the smallest mechanical nudge that preserves drama.\index{Design Philosophy}
\item \textbf{Escalate with Consent.} Offer players the choice to escalate Minor to Major by taking +1 (SB) now to seize something they want.\index{Story Beats!player choice}
\item \textbf{One Bite per Cast.} Apply at most one backlash per cast/action unless a move explicitly stacks. Keep it punchy, not punitive.\index{Backlash!frequency}
\item \textbf{Clocks with Names.} Name clocks (\emph{Spreading Fire}, \emph{Inevitable Outcome}) so they feed the fiction and remind the table what's at stake.\index{Clocks}
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Backlash Cheatsheet (margin-ready)},colback=gray!5,colframe=black]
\small \textbf{Minor = wobble, Major = lurch.} Types: Position/Eff, Clock +1/2 or +1, Condition, Cost. Offer Major by (SB)+1. Earth/Fate binds; Fire/Life burns/grows; Air/Luck scatters/ flips; Water/Obishaal pulls/opens.\par\smallskip
Place a mini version of Table~\ref{tab:backlash-8x2} on character sheets.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Rites Users (Runekeepers)}
\label{subsec:runekeepers}

Runekeepers bind themselves to structured \emph{Rites} from a single Patron.

\begin{description}
\item[Requirement] \textbf{Thiasos (Familiar)} (2 XP) \emph{and} \textbf{Codex} (4 XP). Runekeepers are restricted to \textbf{one} Patron.
\item[Mechanics] \textbf{Invoke} a known \emph{Rite} as \textbf{1 action}; on completion, mark \textbf{+1 Obligation} to that Patron. \emph{Push It} once/scene for amplified effect (\textbf{+1 Obligation}).
\item[Patron's Gift (Imbuement)] With Thiasos, once/scene as \textbf{1 action} imbue a held item for the scene with \textbf{+1 Melee} and \textbf{+1 Thematic} (a fixed Skill set by the Patron; see Table in \S\ref{sec:rites}). \emph{Push It} to extend one additional scene (\textbf{+1 Obligation}). A Codex is \emph{not} required for the Gift.
\end{description}

\section{Rites Difficulty Value (Expanded)}
\label{sec:rites-dv-expanded}
\index{Rites!Difficulty Value}
\index{DV}

\subsection*{Core Rule}

The Difficulty Value (DV) to cast a Rite is:

\[
\text{DV} = \max\!\big(\text{Obligation Cost} - \text{Spirit}, \, \text{Tier}\big)
\]

\begin{description}
  \item[Obligation Cost:] The Rite’s listed cost in Obligation segments. This reflects the Patron’s toll for the magic.
  \item[Spirit:] The caster’s Spirit attribute. Each point reduces the effective weight of the Obligation, representing inner resilience and willpower.
  \item[Tier:] The Rite’s intrinsic difficulty based on scope or potency. DV can never fall below this floor.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Design Philosophy}

This formula balances three forces:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Debt vs. Strength:} Powerful Rites impose heavier Obligation, but high Spirit offsets that burden.
  \item \textbf{Narrative Tier Floor:} Even the simplest ritual of summoning or warding retains a minimum DV based on its Tier, ensuring gravity and consistency.
  \item \textbf{Scaling:} As characters grow, Spirit makes weaker Rites feel easier, while greater costs still challenge them.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Worked Examples}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Novice Example:} A Tier~1 Rite with Obligation Cost~2, cast by a Spirit~1 character:
  DV = $\max(2-1, 1) = 1$.
  The character feels only a slight strain, their Spirit covering most of the toll.

  \item \emph{Mid-Level Example:} A Tier~2 Rite with Obligation Cost~4, cast by a Spirit~2 character:
  DV = $\max(4-2, 2) = 2$.
  The Rite taxes them, but their Spirit prevents the burden from becoming overwhelming.

  \item \emph{Advanced Example:} A Tier~3 Rite with Obligation Cost~7, cast by a Spirit~3 character:
  DV = $\max(7-3, 3) = 4$.
  Here, Obligation dominates—the cost is heavy, and even strong Spirit cannot fully deflect it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{GM Guidance}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Patron Themes:} Higher Obligation costs should reflect narrative weight, not just numbers. A Patron of decay may exact tolls in corruption, while a Patron of luck might demand reckless wagers.
  \item \textbf{Spirit as Fiction:} Encourage players to describe how their Spirit manifests—does it show as discipline, willpower, ritual focus, or raw charisma? Make the stat come alive in the fiction.
  \item \textbf{Scaling with Tier:} Remind players that no matter how trivial the fiction might feel, a Tier~2 or higher Rite is never “easy.” The floor maintains tension.
\end{itemize}

\section{Obligation Capacity}

A character’s \textbf{Obligation Capacity} equals Spirit + Presence.
Track total Obligation segments across all Patrons (or Symbols, for Invokers).

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Exceeding Capacity:} For each segment above Capacity, mark 1 Fatigue. The character cannot Invoke Rites or perform rituals until Obligation is reduced below Capacity.
  \item \textbf{Resolution:} Reduce Obligation through Downtime service, Patron tasks, ritual cleansing, or story resolution.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} Spirit~2 + Presence~3 = Capacity 5.
6 segments → Fatigue~1.
7 segments → Fatigue~2.
10 segments → Harm~1.
11 segments → Harm~2.

\subsection*{Optional Modules}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Overflow DV:} If DV exceeds 5, consider applying minor narrative complications or Backlash risks on top of the roll, to show strain bleeding into the scene.
  \item \textbf{Patron Wrath Trigger:} A Patron may impose extra narrative tolls if the DV was reached primarily through Obligation rather than Tier—this shows over-dependence on their favor.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Invokers (Symbol Path)}
\label{subsec:invokers}

Invokers use consecrated \textbf{Symbols} as ritual anchors to access a Patron's \emph{Rites} without a full bond.

\begin{description}
\item[Requirement] \textbf{Patron's Symbol} (4 XP) per Patron; one Symbol per Patron. No Thiasos or Codex required.
\item[Ritual Invocation] Perform the \emph{Rite} as a \textbf{ritual} DV +1 rounds. Completion always marks \textbf{+1 Obligation}.
\item[Crack the Seal] Resolve instantly as \textbf{1 action} by setting the Symbol to \emph{Compromised} and marking \textbf{+2 Obligation} (\textbf{+3} if High-Power). The GM may immediately spend 1 on-theme SB. Restore in Downtime (test DV 3 or by fiction) or spend 1 XP.
\item[Limits] Symbols must be openly displayed during the ritual; carrying \textbf{4+} Symbols causes +1 Obligation on the first ritual each scene; rival Symbol interference may worsen Position and add +1 Obligation.
\end{description}

% --- Talent: Borrowed Grace (Invoker) ---
\section*{Borrowed Grace}
\label{talent:borrowed-grace}
\index{Talents!Invoker}\index{Imbuement!Lesser}

\textbf{Type:} Invoker Talent — \textit{Lesser Imbuement}

\subsection*{Use}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cost:} 1 Boon, 1 action.
  \item \textbf{Effect (pick one on use):} \textbf{+1 Melee} \emph{or} \textbf{+1 Thematic} (your table's thematic Skill).
  \item \textbf{Duration:} \textit{Single action/attack} (instantaneous boost).
  \item \textbf{Requirement:} Wield/display the Patron's \textbf{Symbol}.
  \item \textbf{Obligation:} +1 \textbf{Obligation} to that Patron immediately (see \S\ref{sec:obligation}).
  \item \textbf{Limits:} Cannot be extended, stacked, or \emph{Pushed} for duration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Fictional Framing}
A quick, rule-bending channel through a Patron's \emph{Symbol}—a sliver of grace, borrowed for a moment and paid for in debt.

\subsection*{Table Guidance (1-liners)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Combat:} Spike a strike vs. a tough foe; or steady a parry in a desperate bind.
  \item \textbf{Skill:} Nudge a pivotal social/ritual/track roll tied to the Patron's sphere.
  \item \textbf{Fallout:} Repeated use accrues \textbf{Obligation}; NPC faithful may notice "stolen" grace.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Balance Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Weaker than full Imbuement: \emph{one} action, no sustain, upfront Obligation.
  \item \textbf{Symbol dependency:} No Symbol, no channel (concealed or lost Symbol = no effect).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{GM Hooks (quick picks)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Compel Debt:} A Patron agent arrives when Obligation crosses a tick.
  \item \textbf{Clash of Signs:} Using rival Symbols back-to-back risks minor \textbf{Backlash} (drop Position or +1 SB).
  \item \textbf{Spotlight Tell:} Brief visual tell (scent, sigil flare) marks the borrowing to observant NPCs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summoners (Pact-Whisperer)}
\label{subsec:summoners}

Summoners call spirits quickly and manage them with a \emph{Leash} track.

\paragraph{Talents \& Access}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Lesser Pactwright:} You may \emph{Call} spirits of Cap~1.
  \item \textbf{Greater Pactwright:} You may also \emph{Call} spirits of Cap~3.
  \item \textbf{Dual Pactwright:} With both Lesser and Greater Pactwright, you may maintain one spirit of each Cap simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Core Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Call (1 action):} A spirit manifests at \textit{Near}. Choose a Spirit Template (by fiction).
  \item \textbf{Bind (no extra roll):} Choose one: spend \textbf{1 Boon} \emph{or} mark \textbf{1 Fatigue}.
  \item \textbf{Leash:} Set \textit{Leash} = \textbf{Cap + 2} segments on the spirit.
  \item \textbf{Tick Leash} whenever any of the following happen: the spirit takes harm; you command it against its nature; you \emph{split focus} (you take another significant action while it acts on your order); a rival contests it; it rushes from \textit{Close} to \textit{Far} under pressure. Crossing a \texttt{[WARD]} uses the Outsider crossing rules (DV = Cap).
  \item \textbf{Release:} When the Leash fills, the spirit acts to its nature \emph{once}, then departs.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Economy \& Limits}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Boon Finesse:} Once per round, you may spend \textbf{1 Boon} to clear \textbf{1} Leash tick on your current spirit (not after it has already filled).
  \item \textbf{Action Economy:} Issuing a meaningful command uses your action.
  \item \textbf{Concurrency:} Limit \textbf{one active spirit} at a time (you may \emph{Call} again after departure).
  \item \textbf{Downtime} ends all summons unless an ability explicitly states otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Nature of Magic}
\label{sec:nature-of-magic}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Volatile by design:} Each working pushes boundaries that resist being bent.
\item \textbf{Risk embodied:} Each 1 on any magic roll generates SB the GM can spend for backlash or twists.
\item \textbf{Narrative weight:} Every magical action alters the scene, even on a success.
\item \textbf{Thematic consequence:} Backlash aligns with the invoked Element or its opposition.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Eight Elements}
\label{sec:eight-elements}

\subsection{Physical}
\paragraph{Earth} Solidity, structure; shape/sense/move stone; backlash: rigidity/collapse. \quad
\paragraph{Fire} Energy, change; ignite/heat/purify; backlash: spread/scorch. \quad
\paragraph{Air} Motion, sound; push/pull/resonance; backlash: dispersal/whip. \quad
\paragraph{Water} Flow, repair; channel/cleanse/mend; backlash: flood/contaminate.

\subsection{Metaphysical}
\paragraph{Fate} Causality, oaths, anti-magic; backlash: paradox/closure. \quad
\paragraph{Life} Vitality, growth, repair; backlash: overgrowth/fever. \quad
\paragraph{Luck} Chance, openings; backlash: side-coincidence/irony. \quad
\paragraph{Death/Dreams (Obishaal)} Thresholds, Ways Between; backlash: thin walls/nightmares.

\section{Magical Arts}
\label{sec:magical-arts}

Define your \emph{Art} (gesture/medium, two typical Elements, signature style). If the Art is clearly honored in fiction, gain \textbf{+1 die} on your \textbf{Cast} once/scene (counts toward +3 cap). Working hard against your Art can worsen Position or pre-load backlash on a Partial.

\section{Casting Loop (Freeform)}
\label{sec:casting-loop}

\textbf{Channel:} Focus and draw Potential (e.g., Wits+Arcana); successes become shaping fuel; each 1 generates SB.\\
\textbf{Weave:} Next turn, shape the effect (e.g., Wits+Art); apply the Description Ladder (Basic/Detailed/Intricate) per core rules.\\
\textbf{Backlash:} GM spends SB thematically by Element; severity scales with SB and scope. Boons do not reduce SB unless a source says so.

\section{Magic in Combat}
\label{sec:magic-combat}

Casting typically takes two actions (Channel + Weave). Runekeeper \emph{Rites} resolve in one action (with Obligation risk). Invoker rituals are usually too slow for a fight—use \emph{Crack the Seal} for instant results at high cost. \texttt{[COUNTER]} can interrupt any magical action in its window.

\end{table}

\section{Guardrails}
\label{sec:magic-guardrails}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Duration defaults:} Buffs $\approx$ 3 beats; areas 1 beat. Sustaining costs 1 Fatigue/beat.
\item \textbf{Stacking:} Same-source effects do not stack; take the best instance.
\item \textbf{Assist cap:} +3 dice total from assists/buffs.
\item \textbf{Over-Stack:} Active magic can count as structural advantages for Over-Stack.
\item \textbf{Plausibility:} All effects must fit the fiction and established limits.

\section{Summons and Outsiders}

\subsection{Definition}
An \textbf{Outsider} is any being not native to the world of Fate's Edge. This includes summoned spirits, demons, celestials, and entities that arrive from beyond the veil of the Eight Elements. They are powerful but dangerous to bind.

\subsection{Summoning (Pact-Whisperer Core)}
Summoning is a way to call and bind Outsiders for temporary aid.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Call} (1 Action): A spirit manifests at Near range. Choose a Spirit Template.
  \item \textbf{Bind}: Choose one: spend 1 Boon or mark 1 Fatigue.
  \item \textbf{Leash}: Set Leash = Cap + 2 segments (Cap is the Outsider's tier, typically 1/3/5 for Lesser/Greater/Elder).
  \item \textbf{Tick Leash} whenever any occur:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Spirit takes harm.
      \item You command against its nature.
      \item You split focus (take another significant action while it acts).
      \item A rival contests it.
      \item It moves from Close to Far quickly.
      \item It crosses a [WARD].
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Departure}: When the Leash fills, the spirit acts to its nature once, then departs.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Limits:} Only one active summoned spirit at a time (unless a Talent says otherwise). All summons depart at Downtime unless explicitly sustained.

\subsection{Boon Finesse}
Once per round, you may spend 1 Boon to clear 1 tick from your current spirit's Leash. You cannot do this after the Leash has filled.

\subsection{Outsider Caps}
\begin{itemize}
  \item PC-summoned Outsiders: Cap is limited by Talents (Lesser = 1, Greater = 3).
  \item NPC Outsiders: GM assigns based on story needs (Lesser = 1, Greater = 3, Elder = 5).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tags for Summons \& Outsiders}
Certain Tags specifically interact with Outsiders.

\begin{description}[leftmargin=1.5em, style=nextline]
  \item[WARD:] Creates a magical edge/zone that Outsiders must test to cross.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item DV = Outsider's Cap.
      \item Hit: Outsider crosses and its Leash gains +DV segments.
      \item Partial: Outsider crosses and its Leash gains +1 segment.
      \item Miss: Outsider fails to cross this beat.
    \end{itemize}
  \item[BANISH:] Drives a visible Outsider toward departure.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item DV = Outsider's Cap.
      \item Hit: Add +DV segments to its Leash (or Exit Tally).
      \item Partial: Add +1 segment.
      \item Miss: No effect.
    \end{itemize}
  \item[UNWARD:] Suppresses or dismisses a [WARD].
    \begin{itemize}
      \item DV by fiction (materials, sanctity, prep, locus, opposition).
      \item Hit: Ward dismissed/suppressed.
      \item Partial: Ward suppressed briefly (1 beat).
      \item Miss: No effect.
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsection{Unified Leash / Exit Tally System}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Summoned Outsiders track their service via a \textbf{Leash} (Cap + 2 segments).
  \item Non-summoned Outsiders affected by [WARD] or [BANISH] gain a temporary \textbf{Exit Tally} = Cap + 2. When the tally fills, they act to nature once, then depart.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GM Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Summons are not permanent allies; they are volatile forces.
  \item Always color Outsider behavior by their Elemental resonance and domain.
  \item When the Leash fills, deliver a memorable "act to nature" moment before they vanish.
  \item Use SB to escalate Outsider complications: a jealous Patron, a backlash of strange omens, or collateral spiritual harm.
\end{itemize}

\section{Elemental Backlash}\label{sec:backlash-tables}
\index{Backlash}\index{Elements}\index{Story Beats}\index{Realms}\index{Obishaal@Obishaal (Dreams/Thresholds)}

When magic disturbs the weave, the world pushes back. Backlash manifests as fiction-first complications with light mechanical teeth. Each element (and its metaphysical counterpart) has a \textbf{Minor} and \textbf{Major} pattern.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Using Backlash at the Table},colback=gray!5,colframe=black]
\textbf{Trigger.} A roll shows a 1 (gaining a (SB)) or the text explicitly says "accept 1 (SB) to escalate."\newline
\textbf{Choose One:} Apply the table's Minor effect, or escalate to Major by adding $\mathbf{+1}$ (SB) immediately.\newline
\textbf{Mechanical Nudge Types.} \emph{Position/Effect shift}, \emph{Clock tick (1/2)}, \emph{Condition}, or \emph{Immediate Cost}.\index{Story Beats!backlash escalation}

\section{Rituals (Extended)}\label{sec:rituals-extended}
\index{Rituals}\index{Story Beats}\index{Backlash}\index{Elements}\index{Realms}\index{Obishaal@Obishaal}\index{Patrons}\index{Symbols}\index{Runekeeper}\index{Invoker}\index{Summoner}\index{Caster}

Rituals are \emph{slow magic}: explicit intent, staged action, and negotiated risk. They are how characters bend the world carefully, trading time, components, and narrative exposure for precise results. This section expands the SRD quick-start (\S\ref{sec:universal-rituals}) with procedures, dials, and worked examples.

\subsection{Design Goals}\label{subsec:ritual-goals}\index{Design Philosophy}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fiction-first.} Components and steps are story handles, not inventory chores.
\item \textbf{Visible costs.} Every ritual declares \emph{what it costs} (time, component loss, conditions) and \emph{how it risks} (SB)/backlash.
\item \textbf{Tempting choices.} Players can \emph{push}—accept (SB) to escalate position/effect/scale.
\item \textbf{Portable.} Works for Runekeepers, Invokers, Summoners, and Free Casters with minimal chassis-specific tweaks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ritual Procedure}\label{subsec:ritual-procedure}
Use this skeleton for any ritual, published or improvised.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Step \arabic*:}, leftmargin=2.2em]
\item \textbf{State Intent.} What do you want? Clarify element/Realm if obvious (Fire for heat, Water for memory, Fate for anti-magic, Obishaal for thresholds).\index{Elements!choosing}
\item \textbf{Choose Scope.} Size, duration, range, and detail. Start modest; escalations come later.
\item \textbf{Lay Components.} Name \emph{two things}: (a) \textbf{Focus} (tool/site/patron sign), (b) \textbf{Fuel} (herb, blood, pact, memory). Decide which is consumed vs. retained.\index{Components}
\item \textbf{Set Time.} Default: \emph{Low 1 minute / Med 5–10 minutes / High 15–20 minutes}. More time improves position/effect; rushing worsens it.
\item \textbf{Call Risks.} Point to the element's \textbf{Backlash} (\S\ref{sec:backlash-condensed}) and the default \textbf{(SB) trigger}: any 1 rolled creates a (SB); re-rolling 1s does not remove (SB) and may add another.
\item \textbf{Roll and Resolve.} Apply position/effect and any clocks. Offer a \emph{push}: take +1 (SB) to step up result now.
\item \textbf{Mark Costs.} Consume components, apply Conditions, or tick wear/concurrency (per chassis). Close the scene hooks the ritual created.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Component Economy}\label{subsec:component-economy}
Components are levers, not taxes. Use them to signal tone and stakes.

Fuel (consumed) & Herb bundle, salt vial, blood drop, silver bead, memory-laden note. & –1 \emph{time step} (faster) or +1 \emph{effect} step if expensive/rare. \\
Site (context) & Crossroads, standing stones, bathhouse, bell tower at midnight. & Shift backlash element or re-route it (e.g., into \emph{Alarmed Attention} clock). \\
Vow (social) & Sworn phrase, bargain pledge, offered favor. & If broken, immediate (SB) +1 and an intrusion linked to the vow. \\

\subsection{Teamwork and Aid}\label{subsec:ritual-teamwork}\index{Teamwork}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hands \& Voices.} Each assistant names one component they contribute; either reduces cast time \emph{or} accepts up to 1 (SB) on the caster's behalf once per ritual.
\item \textbf{Focus Chain.} Passing the Focus around the circle grants advantage on the finishing action but risks \textsc{Distracted} if interrupted.
\item \textbf{Distributed Load.} Splitting a High ritual into two coordinated Mediums avoids a Major backlash but creates two Minor hooks instead.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Clocks and Outcomes}\label{subsec:ritual-clocks}\index{Clocks}
Tie every consequential ritual to \textbf{named clocks}. Examples: \emph{Spreading Fire}, \emph{Inevitable Outcome}, \emph{Crossing Due}, \emph{Alarmed Attention}. Advancing or reducing clocks is often better than flat bonuses.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Outcome Palette},colback=gray!5,colframe=black]
\small \textbf{On a strong result:} full effect, +1 effect step, or Clock –1.\newline
\textbf{On a mixed:} effect with a cost (component consumed; condition applied).\newline
\textbf{On a weak:} effect limited; Clock +1/2; Minor Backlash.\newline
\textbf{On a push:} player may take (SB) +1 to upgrade one step immediately.\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Backlash Integration}\label{subsec:ritual-backlash}
Use the condensed table (\S\ref{tab:backlash-condensed}). Calibrate by scene weight: exploratory scenes favor Minor; pivotal moments bait a Major via (SB) +1.

\subsection{Chassis-Specific Notes}\label{subsec:ritual-chassis}
\paragraph{Runekeeper.}\index{Runekeeper} Embed Rites as \emph{accelerants}: a published Rite may count as a Focus that upgrades position or halves time.
\paragraph{Invoker.}\index{Invoker} Symbols accumulate \emph{wear}; a maintenance rite can clear 1 wear mid-scene on success \emph{or} shift backlash from Major to Minor.
\paragraph{Summoner.}\index{Summoner} \emph{Gate} effects occupy concurrency slots. Disruption on broken terms: (SB) +1 and the entity acts on its last instruction.
\paragraph{Caster (Free).}\index{Caster} Tags become explicit ritual steps (\emph{bind, veil, reveal})—chain two compatible tags once/scene for a synergy bump without extra cost.

\subsection{Worked Examples}\label{subsec:ritual-examples}
\paragraph{Example 1: Quiet Veil (Team Infiltration).}\index{Rituals!examples}
\emph{Intent:} silence the group for one scene. \emph{Scope:} corridor sweep. \emph{Components:} ash (fuel, consumed), bell (focus, kept). \emph{Time:} 5 minutes. \emph{Risks:} Air/Luck Minor on 1; offer Major to avoid dogs' scent. \emph{Roll:} mixed—effect with cost. \emph{Outcome:} \textsc{Muted} condition until scene ends; Clock –1/2 on \emph{Patrol Pass}. Player takes (SB) +1 to also foil scent (Major avoided by paying the (SB)).

\paragraph{Example 2: River's Memory (Investigation).}
\emph{Intent:} view last night's ferry landing. \emph{Scope:} a few minutes of blurred images. \emph{Components:} bowl, token from dock. \emph{Time:} 10 minutes. \emph{Risk:} Water/Obishaal Minor. \emph{Roll:} strong—clear image; token ruined per Cost. \emph{Outcome:} Clock –1 on \emph{Where did the courier go?}; whisper from the Ways foreshadows a revenant (hook).

\paragraph{Example 3: Fate-Splice (Boss Rescue).}
\emph{Intent:} move the poison consequence from the prince to the knight. \emph{Scope:} one Major consequence. \emph{Components:} paired names on vellum; vow. \emph{Time:} 15 minutes. \emph{Risk:} Fate/Earth. \emph{Roll:} weak—Minor Backlash; \emph{Inevitable Outcome} +1/2. \emph{Push:} (SB) +1 to capture the full consequence anyway. \emph{Outcome:} knight bears the poison; the \textsc{Omen} mark appears (future hook).

\subsection{Safety and Consent}\label{subsec:ritual-safety}\index{Safety}
Rituals often touch body horror, spiritual intrusion, or coercive bargains. Use lines/veils, X-card, script change, or your table's preferred tools. Make \textbf{vows} opt-in; provide non-coercive alternatives with different trade-offs.

\subsection{Optional Modules}\label{subsec:ritual-modules}
\paragraph{Entropy Counters.} Track ritual entropy per scene; at 3+ entropy, the next Minor backlash upgrades to Major automatically. Resets on scene change.
\paragraph{Resonance Sites.} Mark places that boost one element (+1 effect) and hinder its counterpart (–1 position). Crossing a resonance flips the pairing.
\paragraph{Material Tags.} Let special materials act like tags (cold iron, voidglass) granting narrow immunities or redirecting backlash type.

\subsection{GM Troubleshooting}\label{subsec:ritual-troubleshooting}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pacing drifts long.} Shorten cast time by consuming an extra Fuel component; keep one meaningful step.
\item \textbf{Risk feels toothless.} Name a clock and advance it on mixed/weak even if the effect lands.
\item \textbf{Runekeeper dominates.} Insert a \emph{Rune Draw} tell for high-grade rites \emph{or} grant Invokers a mid-scene maintenance clear on a solid success.
\item \textbf{Summons flood scene.} Enforce concurrency and Disruption (\S\ref{subsec:ritual-chassis}).
\item \textbf{Casters feel mushy.} Require two explicit tags per ritual step (bind/veil/reveal); grant once/scene synergy bump.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Summary},colback=gray!5,colframe=black]
Rituals trade \textbf{time, components, and exposure} for \textbf{precision and scale}. Keep costs visible, risk tempting, and outcomes named via clocks. Offer players the choice to buy bigger results with (SB)—then pay off every hook
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Talent: Cantor's Path --- ``Songs of the Low Rites''}
\label{talent:cantors-path}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Cantor's Path}]
You echo the liturgies of Patrons through breath and string. Not a sworn celebrant but a perilous mimic, you weave Low Rites into song. It is slower, riskier, and beautiful---but never free.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{Type} Major Talent (15 XP) \quad
\paragraph*{Prerequisites} \textbf{Lore 1+}, \textbf{Performance 2+}, \textbf{Presence 2+} \quad
\paragraph*{Access} Any character (does not require Thiasos membership).

\subsection*{Effect}
You may learn and perform \textbf{Low Rites as Songs}. Each Song counts as knowing the associated Low Rite for performance purposes only.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Casting Test:} \emph{Lore + Performance vs.\ DV} (default DV = 2--3).
  \item \textbf{Action Economy:} \emph{1 action to begin;} Song \emph{resolves at the start of your next turn} unless accelerated.
  \item \textbf{Scope:} \emph{Low Rites only.} Standard/High Rites remain exclusive to Patrons and Thiasos initiates.
  \item \textbf{Costs:} Pay any \emph{materials} listed. On success you do \emph{not} mark Obligation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Corruption Clock}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You gain a personal \textbf{Corruption Clock} equal in segments to your \textbf{Body} rating.
  \item Each time you cast a Song or whenever the Keeper spends a Story Beat involving you, mark +1 segment.
  \item When the Clock fills:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item You immediately gain a trait of corruption from the \textbf{last Patron} whose Rite you performed.
      \item All of your followers, retainers, or familiars also gain a trait of the same corruption (NPCs manifest visibly unsettling traits).
      \item Reset the Clock to empty.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Corruption traits gained in this way fade at the next \indexterm{Downtime}, unless reinforced by further Patron influence.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Outcomes}
\begin{description}
\item[Success:] The Low Rite takes effect as written.
\item[Partial:] The Rite manifests with reduced effect (–1 step) or shortened duration. Mark \textbf{Fatigue 1}.
\item[Failure:] No effect; mark \textbf{Fatigue 1} and the Keeper gains \textbf{+1 SB (Hearts)}.
\item[Interrupted:] Harm, Silence, or disruption before resolution = treat as Failure.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Push It}
When you Push:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Song resolves immediately instead of next round.
  \item Mark \textbf{Fatigue 1}.
  \item Add +1 to your \textbf{Corruption Clock}.
  \item Keeper immediately triggers a \textbf{Story Beat}, representing fallout from a Patron, the Road, or social attention.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Limits \& Interactions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Stacking:} Cannot benefit from the same Rite twice.
  \item \textbf{Visibility:} Songs are inherently noticeable. On Failure or Push, assume observers take note.
  \item \textbf{Silence/Disruption:} Impose –1 to –3 dice at Keeper’s discretion.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Downtime Transition}
At any \indexterm{Downtime}, a character with \textbf{Cantor’s Path} may permanently exchange this talent for initiation into a \indexterm{Thiasos} and access to its \indexterm{Codex}. This represents the Patron or their agents taking note of the Cantor’s repeated Songs and recruiting them into a formal structure. The Cantor loses their personal \textbf{Corruption Clock} and instead adopts the standard \textbf{Obligation} and \textbf{Codex access} mechanics of a Runekeeper. Any existing corruption traits carry forward as “first marks” of Patronal bond, shaping how the Thiasos views and employs them.
