# Fate's Edge SRD Rule Skeleton & Heuristics

## Core Resolution Framework

### Basic Dice Mechanics
```
ROLL: Attribute (1-5) + Skill (0-5) = dice pool (d10s)
COUNT: 6+ = Success, 1 = Complication Point (CP)
COMPARE: Total Successes vs Difficulty Value (DV 1-4+)
RESOLVE: Outcome Matrix + CP consequences
```

### Outcome Matrix Heuristics
- **Clean Success**: Intent achieved crisply (DV met, no CP)
- **Success & Cost**: Intent + GM spends CP for complications
- **Partial**: Progress with fork (accept cost OR concede ground)
- **Miss**: No progress, GM spends CP OR offer Devil's Bargain

### Difficulty Value Guidelines
```
DV 1 - Routine: Clear intent, modest stakes, controlled environment
DV 2 - Pressured: Time pressure, mild resistance, partial info
DV 3 - Hard: Hostile conditions, active opposition, precise timing
DV 4+ - Extreme: Multiple constraints, high precision, dramatic failure
```

## Character Advancement System

### XP Economy Principles
```
BASE: 30 XP starting budget
AWARD: 6-10 XP per session (standard pace)
SPEND: Enhance Self | Acquire Assets | Learn Talents
COSTS: Attributes(new×3) | Skills(new×2) | Followers(Cap²)
```

### Growth Path Heuristics
- **Solo Path**: 70-90% Enhance Self, 0-10% Assets, 0-20% Talents
- **Mixed Path**: 50-65% Self, 15-25% Assets, 15-25% Talents
- **Mastermind Path**: 25-40% Self, 35-55% Assets, 20-40% Talents

## Resource Management Systems

### Complication Point Spending
```
1 CP - Minor pressure: noise, trace, +1 Supply segment
2 CP - Moderate setback: alarm, lose position, lesser foe
3 CP - Serious trouble: reinforcements, key gear breaks, rail tick
4+ CP - Major turn: trap springs, authority arrives, scene shifts
```

### Boon Economy
```
EARN: From embracing complications, partial successes, hard choices
SPEND: Re-roll die | Activate Asset (1 Boon) | Convert 2→1 XP
LIMIT: Max 5 Boons, overflow converts to XP (2→1, max 2/session)
```

### Condition Tracks
```
ASSETS/FOLLOWERS: Maintained → Neglected → Compromised
PARTY RESOURCES: Supply (0-Full → 2-Low → 3-Dangerous → 4-Empty)
CHARACTER STATE: Fatigue (1-4 levels, re-roll successes)
```

## World Interaction Systems

### Travel Framework
```
DRAW: Until all suits appear (Spade=Place, Heart=Actor, Club=Pressure, Diamond=Leverage)
CLOCK: By highest rank (2-5=4, 6-10=6, J/Q/K=8, A=10)
RESOLVE: Success=advance, Failure=delay/debt/diversion + consequence
```

### Deck of Consequences
```
SUITS: Hearts(Social) | Diamonds(Resources) | Clubs(Physical) | Spades(Mystical)
RANKS: 2-5(Minor) | 6-9(Moderate) | 10-K(Severe) | Ace(Catastrophic)
SPEND: 1 CP = 1 card draw, interpret suit/theme + rank/severity
```

## Magic & Special Abilities

### Casting Loop
```
1. CHANNEL: Wits + Arcana → gather Potential (successes) + CP immediately
2. WEAVE: Wits + Art → shape spell with Description benefits
3. BACKLASH: GM spends CP from steps 1+2 for thematic consequences
```

### Talent Design Heuristics
```
EARLY (3-5 XP): Once/scene ability, +1 die, or minor narrative edge
MID (6-10 XP): Once/session ability, significant edge, or codified outcome
PRESTIGE (12+ XP): Once/arc ability, scene-reshaping, or faction-level impact
PREREQS: Logical (Skill 3+, Attribute 3+, owned Asset, cultural affinity)
```

## Campaign & Story Framework

### Campaign Clocks
```
MANDATE (0-6): Table's public legitimacy and buy-in
CRISIS (0-6): Opposition engine (rivals, pressure rails, attrition)
TRIGGERS: Player-called (Mandate≥cap, Crisis≤mid) OR Forced (Crisis≥cap)
```

### Crown Spread (Session 0)
```
DRAW: Spade(Site) | Heart(Rival) | Club(Pressure) | Diamond(Leverage) | Wild
DEFINE: Campaign themes, finale conditions, legacy hooks
RESOLVE: Epilogue converts assets/followers to setting changes
```

## Scaling & Balance Heuristics

### Mixed-Tier Party Scaling
```
BALANCED: Obstacle ≈ average PC tier
HARD: Obstacle = highest PC tier  
BOSS: Obstacle = highest tier +1
ADJUST: CP floor, severity ceiling, position defaults
```

### Follower/Asset Balance
```
FOLLOWER COST: Cap² XP (Cap 3 = 9 XP, Cap 5 = 25 XP)
ASSIST CAP: min(Cap, relevant Skill) max +3 total
ASSET TIERS: Minor(4) | Standard(8) | Major(12) | Tier III(16-20)
UPKEEP: Coin equal to Cap OR Significant Time scene
```

## Design Philosophy Guardrails

### Core Principles
1. **Narrative Primacy**: Mechanics serve story, not replace it
2. **Risk as Drama**: Every roll carries potential for triumph + complication  
3. **Meaningful Growth**: XP investment creates lasting character/world change
4. **Consequence Weight**: Choices ripple outward, nothing is free

### Mechanical Constraints
```
ASSIST MAX: +3 dice total per roll, regardless of helpers
BOON MAX: 5 total, 2→1 XP conversion once/session
INITIATIVE: 1 Follower Action per scene crew-wide
OVER-STACK: 2+ structural advantages = start rails +1 OR GM banks +1 CP
POSITION: Controlled | Risky | Desperate (affects success/failure texture)
```

This skeleton provides the mathematical and procedural foundation for the complete SRD while maintaining the design philosophy of consequence-driven storytelling.
