# Fate's Edge

## Introduction

Fate's Edge is a narrative-first tabletop RPG where every action carries weight, every choice has consequence, and every spell risks backlash. This comprehensive system reference document covers all core rules and expansions.

## Core Resolution System

### The Art of Consequence
All significant actions follow this three-step process:
1. **Approach**: Player describes intent and method
2. **Execution**: Roll Attribute + Skill d10s (6+ = success, 1 = Story Beat)
3. **Outcome**: GM interprets successes vs DV, spends Story Beats for complications

### Attributes (1-5)
- **Body**: Strength, endurance, physical action
- **Wits**: Perception, cleverness, reaction speed
- **Spirit**: Willpower, intuition, resilience
- **Presence**: Charm, command, social force

### Skills (0-5)
- **Melee, Ranged, Athletics**
- **Sway, Deception, Insight**
- **Stealth, Survival, Command**
- **Arcana, Lore, Craft**

### Difficulty Values (DV)
| DV | Situation |
|----|-----------|
| 2 | Routine: Clear intent, modest stakes |
| 3 | Pressured: Time pressure, mild resistance |
| 4 | Hard: Hostile conditions, active opposition |
| 5+ | Extreme: Multiple constraints, high precision |

### Position & Effect
- **Position**: Dominant (safe), Controlled (typical), Desperate (high risk/high reward)
- **Effect**: Limited (weak), Standard (expected), Great (strong)

### Outcome Matrix
| Result | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| Successes ≥ DV, 0 SB | Clean Success: Intent achieved |
| Successes ≥ DV, 1+ SB | Success & Cost: Intent + complications |
| 0 < Successes < DV | Partial: Progress with complication (gain 1 Boon) |
| Successes = 0 | Miss: No progress (gain 2 Boons) |

## Story Beats and Boons

### Story Beats (SB)
- Each die showing 1 generates 1 SB
- GM spends SB to introduce narrative twists
- 1 SB: Minor pressure
- 2 SB: Moderate setback
- 3 SB: Serious trouble
- 4+ SB: Major turn

### Boons
- **Miss**: Gain 2 Boons
- **Partial**: Gain 1 Boon
- **Usage**: Re-roll dice, activate Assets, improve Position, convert to XP (2 Boons = 1 XP, max 2 XP/session)
- **Limits**: Hold up to 5 Boons; trim to 2 at scene end

## Combat System

### Combat Procedure
1. Declare action and approach
2. GM sets Position (Dominant/Controlled/Desperate)
3. Roll Attribute + Skill dice
4. Count successes vs DV, 1s generate SB
5. GM resolves outcome and spends SB

### Position in Combat
- **Dominant**: Advantage, cover, tempo
- **Controlled**: Default melee exchange
- **Desperate**: Outnumbered, flanked, exposed

### Initiative and Turn Order
- No fixed initiative
- Turn order follows fiction and GM facilitation
- Surprise: Ambushers act first

### Fatigue
- Track equal to Body rating
- Each Fatigue step worsens Position by one level
- Overflow: When track fills, increase Harm by 1 step and clear Fatigue to 0

### Harm System
- **Level 1**: Minor injury (-1 die to related actions)
- **Level 2**: Serious wound (-1 die to most actions)
- **Level 3**: Critical injury (incapacitated/dying)

## Core Principles

### Identity of Fate's Edge
Fate's Edge is a narrative-first tabletop roleplaying system where every action carries weight, every choice has consequence, and every spell risks backlash. Dice are not simply a measure of success or failure—they are instruments of fate, weaving opportunity with risk.

### Key Concepts
- **Narrative Time**: Measured by story weight (Moment, Some Time, Significant Time, Days)
- **Story Beats**: Generated by 1s on dice rolls, spent by GM for complications
- **Affinity**: Cultural edges or metaphysical bonds
- **Prestige Abilities**: Narrative milestones unlocked by mastery
- **On-Screen vs. Off-Screen**: Direct participation vs. background resources

## GM Quick Reference

### Adjudication Loop
1. Player describes intent and approach
2. Set DV (2-5+) and Position
3. Roll pool = Attribute + Skill
4. Count successes (6+) and SB (1s)
5. Resolve outcome from matrix
6. Spend SB for complications

### SB Spend Menu
- **1 SB**: Minor pressure (noise, trace, +1 Supply)
- **2 SB**: Moderate setback (alarm, lose position, lesser foe)
- **3 SB**: Serious trouble (reinforcements, gear breaks, rail tick)
- **4+ SB**: Major turn (trap springs, authority arrives, scene shifts)

| **Access** | Pact-Whisperer (2 XP) | Cantor's Path (15 XP) | Caster's Gift (2 XP) | Codex (4 XP) + Familiar (2 XP) | Patron's Symbol (4 XP each) |
| **How It Works** | Call → Bind → Command | Perform Song → effect | Weave + Cast | Invoke Rite | Ritual Invocation |
| **Primary Risk** | Loss of Control | Corruption | Backlash | Obligation | Ritual Cost |
| **Speed** | Fast | Moderate | Moderate | Very fast | Slow |

### Player Archetypes
- **The Solo**: Mastery of self, independence
- **The Mixed**: Hybrid adaptability
- **The Mastermind**: Schemes and command

## Core Quick Tools

### Five-Second Position & Effect
**Risk Assessment**:
- **Dominant**: Safe, prepared, low threat
- **Controlled**: Pressure, danger, uncertainty
- **Desperate**: Immediate danger, overmatched, exposed

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Limited**: Partial progress or minor effect
- **Standard**: Normal success
- **Great**: Powerful, overwhelming impact

### The Lazy DV Table
| DV | When to Use | Example |
|----|-------------|---------|
| 2 | Routine, low stakes | Pick lock in safe house |
| 3 | Pressured (default) | Pick lock with guards nearby |
| 4 | Hard, hostile conditions | Pick trapped arcane chest |
| 5+ | Extreme, dramatic risk | Pick magical lock underwater |

### No-Thinking SB Spending
- **1 SB**: Minor pressure (noise, trace, clock +1)
- **2 SB**: Moderate setback (alarm, lose cover, lesser foe)
- **3 SB**: Serious trouble (reinforcements, broken gear)
- **4+ SB**: Major turn (trap springs, authority arrives)

### The Three-Clock Rule
Only three active clocks at once:
1. **Scene Clock**: e.g., Guards Alerted [4]
2. **Journey Clock**: e.g., Mist Encroaches [6]
3. **Campaign Clock**: e.g., Baron's Suspicion [8]

### Magic Adjudication Shortcut
1. Hear the intent
2. Assign fitting TAG (Veil, Ward, Barrier, Glamour, etc.)
3. Pick DV based on scale:
   - Personal/Subtle = DV 2
   - Scene-wide/Strong = DV 3
   - Area/Devastating = DV 4+
4. Choose Position based on danger while casting

## Final Wisdom

### Director Mindset
You are not a rules engine. You are a director choosing the next shot:
- **Clean win**: Character succeeds, story progresses
- **Costly win**: Success with complications
- **Partial success**: Progress made, but with gaps
- **Spiraling disaster**: Situation escalates dramatically

### Design Philosophy Guardrails
- **Narrative Primacy**: Mechanics serve story, not replace it
- **Risk as Drama**: Every roll carries potential for triumph + complication
- **Meaningful Growth**: XP changes characters and the world
- **Consequence Weight**: Choices ripple outward; nothing is free
- **Fail Forward**: Misses fuel Boons; 1s become SB (beats)

Remember: In Fate's Edge, nothing is free — and every choice shapes the world.
