### Core Concept Summary

**Fate's Edge** is a fantasy TTRPG where every action carries weight. It's built on principles of **Narrative Primacy, Risk as Drama, Meaningful Growth, and Consequence Weight**. The game uses a d10 dice pool system (Attribute + Skill) where rolling 1s generates **Complication Points (CP)** that the GM uses to introduce twists and tension. Characters advance by spending XP on one of three paths: enhancing themselves, acquiring assets, or learning unique talents. Magic is powerful but dangerous, following a structured "Casting Loop" that always risks backlash. The world is detailed, with rich cultures, factions, gods, and a unique "Deck of Consequences" system to generate dynamic story elements.

### Key Identified Inconsistencies & Areas for Revision

1.  **Structural Repetition:** The most significant issue is that **Chapter 17: "Compendium of Assets" and Chapter 18: "Compendium of Assets" are identical.** This appears to be a copy-paste error in the document's layout.

2.  **Conflicting Deck Systems:** The rules describe two distinct card-based tools but their explanations are interspersed and could cause confusion.
    *   **Travel Decks:** Used for journeys. Suits mean: Spade=Place, Heart=Actor, Club=Pressure, Diamond=Leverage.
    *   **Deck of Consequences:** Used for scene drama. Suits mean: Hearts=Social, Spades=Harm, Clubs=Material, Diamonds=Magical.
    *   **The Confusion:** While Section 2.11 and 5.1 try to clarify the difference, a reader can easily mix them up. A clearer, side-by-side comparison in a dedicated section would be helpful.

3.  **Unclear "Boon" Economy:** The rules for earning and spending Boons (a core player resource) have some ambiguous or conflicting points.
    *   **Earning from "Partial" Success:** An optional rule suggests awarding a Boon on a "Partial" outcome if the GM spends 3+ CP. It's unclear if this is intended to be the standard or a true variant.
    *   **Carryover Limit:** The rule states Boons are reduced to a maximum of 2 at the end of each "scene," but then defines a "multi-phase set piece" as an exception. The line between a "scene" and a "set piece" is narrative and may be too vague for consistent application.
    *   **Anti-Fishing Dials:** These optional limits (like "Once/Scene (Failures)") are a good idea but feel like a patch for a potentially exploitable core mechanic. They might be streamlined into the main rules.

4.  **Underdeveloped "Enhanced Player Play":** Chapter 22 introduces new concepts like a "Shared Leverage Pool" and "Session Investment Tracker" that don't appear in the core rules. It's presented as an "enhancement," but it's not clear if this is an optional module for advanced play or a replacement for earlier systems. The terminology ("Leverage" vs. "Boons" vs. "Diamonds") adds another layer of potential confusion.

5.  **Starting XP and Build Confusion:**
    *   The introduction states players begin with **30 XP**.
    *   However, all ten example character builds in Chapter 21 have total XP values ranging from **43 to 53 XP**.
    *   Chapter 22.5 then mentions a "maximum starting build of 34 XP" through taking bonds and complications. This directly contradicts both the 30 XP baseline and the example builds.

6.  **Magic System Nuance:** The "Casting Loop" is a great concept, but some specifics could be tightened.
    *   The "Weave" roll uses `Wits + (Art)`, but the list of "Common Magical Arts" is provided without explicit mechanics. The GM and player would need to collaboratively define what skill level a character has in each Art.
    *   The "Backlash Severity Table" is very brief and narrative. While this fits the game's philosophy, some groups might desire more concrete examples of effects for each CP threshold.

### High-Level Recommendations for Revision

*   **Consolidate and Reorganize:** Merge the duplicate assets chapter (17 & 18). Create a single, clear chapter for the card-based systems, explicitly separating Travel Decks from the Deck of Consequences.
*   **Streamline the Boon Economy:** Integrate the best "anti-fishing" ideas into the core rules. Provide clearer, more consistent triggers for earning Boons and solidify the language around scene vs. session carryover.
*   **Clarify Character Creation:** Choose a single, clear starting XP value (e.g., 30 XP) and ensure all examples and optional rules (bonds/complications for extra points) are balanced around it. The example builds should be recalculated to match the official starting point.
*   **Integrate or Isolate Advanced Rules:** Decide if Chapter 22's "Enhanced Player Play" is core or optional. If it's core, its concepts (like Leverage) need to be woven into the foundational chapters. If it's optional, it should be clearly marked as such.
*   **Flesh Out Magic:** Consider providing a small list of example spells for each Art to illustrate the power level and potential backlash effects, setting a benchmark for player-designed spells.
