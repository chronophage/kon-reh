\chapter{Magic and Special Abilities} \label{ch:magic}

Magic in this game is powerful but dangerous—a negotiation with reality itself that always carries risks. This chapter covers the core magical systems: standard \textbf{spellcasting}\index{magic!spellcasting}, \textbf{ritual magic}\index{magic!rituals}, and special \textbf{pact-based abilities}\index{magic!pacts}. Throughout, look for examples and player-facing tips to keep the fiction front and center.

\section{The Nature of Magic} \index{magic!nature}

Magic is not a safe tool but a dangerous force:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Powerful}\index{magic!power}: Can reshape battles, stories, or even the world
\item \textbf{Risky}\index{magic!risk}: Every use generates \textbf{Story Beats (SB)}\index{Story Beats} that manifest as backlash
\item \textbf{Thematic}\index{magic!themes}: Effects and consequences align with the type of magic used
\item \textbf{Volatile}\index{magic!volatility}: Never fully predictable or controllable
\item \textbf{Narrative}\index{magic!narrative}: Casting is always a significant story moment
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Table Vignette:}
\emph{``I can hold the avalanche,'' says Mira, fingers trembling. ``But something will answer.''} The party nods—risk accepted, stakes clear.

\section{Basic Spellcasting} \index{magic!spellcasting}

All spellcasting follows the standard action resolution system but with additional considerations for magical effects.

\subsection*{The Casting Process}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Declare Intent}\index{magic!intent}: What you want the magic to achieve
\item \textbf{Choose Approach}\index{magic!approach}: Which magical skill and method you'll use
\item \textbf{Set Position}\index{position}: \textbf{Controlled}\index{position!Controlled}, \textbf{Risky}\index{position!Risky}, or \textbf{Desperate}\index{position!Desperate} based on circumstances
\item \textbf{Roll}\index{dice pools}: Attribute + Magical Skill
\item \textbf{Resolve}\index{outcomes}: Apply outcomes with magical consequences
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Magical Skills}
Common magical skills include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Arcana}\index{Arcana}: General magical knowledge and theory
\item \textbf{Elemental Magic}\index{Elemental Magic}: Fire, water, earth, air manipulation
\item \textbf{Spiritual Magic}\index{Spiritual Magic}: Communing with spirits, divine magic
\item \textbf{Mental Magic}\index{Mental Magic}: Telepathy, illusion, mind affecting
\item \textbf{Healing Magic}\index{Healing Magic}: Restoration, purification, life magic
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Player Tip:}
State a clear \textbf{intent}\index{magic!intent} and a vivid \textbf{method}\index{magic!approach}. The more concrete the fiction, the easier it is to set fair \textbf{DV}\index{Difficulty Value (DV)} and meaningful consequences.

\section{The Casting Loop} \index{magic!casting loop}

For more significant magical effects, use the structured Casting Loop requiring two actions.

\subsection*{Phase 1: Weave} \index{magic!weave}
Shape the magical effect:
\begin{itemize}
\item Player builds dice pool and rolls
\item On success, they stabilize the spell's form
\item Any 1 rolled may cause narrative backlash related to the Element
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Phase 2: Cast} \index{magic!cast}
Channel the effect into the world:
\begin{itemize}
\item A second roll channels the effect
\item Backlash: Any 1 rolled may cause narrative backlash related to the Element
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Designer Note:}
The \textbf{Casting Loop}\index{magic!casting loop} requires the \textbf{Caster's Gift}\index{Caster's Gift} talent (2 XP) and creates spotlight tension: describe effect now, risk \textbf{Backlash} on each roll.

\section{Backlash Severity} \index{magic!backlash}

\begin{center}
\small
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Roll Result} & \textbf{Backlash Trigger} \\
\midrule
Partial/Miss & Minor backlash (choose one) \\
Miss & Major backlash (choose two) \\
Hit with two or more 1s & Minor backlash alongside success \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Ritual Magic} \index{magic!rituals}

Rituals take Significant Time (typically 10-30 minutes) for powerful effects.

\subsection*{Ritual Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Time}\index{rituals!time}: Significant Time (typically 10-30 minutes)
\item \textbf{Preparation}\index{rituals!preparation}: Specific materials, locations, or conditions
\item \textbf{Focus}\index{rituals!focus}: Undisturbed concentration and coordination
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Invocation}\index{rituals!invocation}: Perform the Rite as a ritual
\item \textbf{Completion}\index{rituals!completion}: Effect manifests, always marks +1 Obligation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Ritual Benefits and Risks}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Risks}\index{rituals!risks}: Time investment, Obligation cost, environmental requirements
\end{itemize}

\section{Rites and Pact Magic} \index{magic!rites} \index{magic!pacts}

Rites are precise magical effects gained through \textbf{pacts}\index{pacts} with powerful entities. There are two main paths to accessing Rites:

\subsection*{The Runekeeper (Rites Path)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires Patron + Thiasos (Familiar) + Codex (4 XP)
\item Accesses that Patron's full Rite list
\item Structured, powerful, but accrues \textbf{Obligation}
\item Can Push Rites once per scene for +1 Obligation
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Invoker (Symbol Path)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires one or more \textbf{Patron's Symbols} (4 XP each)
\item Accesses ritual invocation of Patron's Rites
\item Safe but slow—requires Significant Time
\item Can Crack the Seal for instant cast at steep Obligation cost (+2/+3)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Using Rites}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Invocation}\index{Rites!invocation}: Invoke a Rite requires 1 Action
\item \textbf{Obligation}\index{Obligation}: Each Rite used marks Obligation on its clock
\item \textbf{Effect}\index{Rites!effect}: The Rite's specific effect manifests
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Rite Invocation via Symbol}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Time.} Invoking a Rite via Symbol takes \(\text{DV} + 1\) rounds.
  \item \textbf{Obligation.} On completion, mark +1 Obligation (in addition to any listed Rite costs, if applicable).
  \item \textbf{No Push.} Invoker Rites cannot use \emph{Push It} benefits.
  \item \textbf{Symbol Display.} The Symbol must remain visible throughout the invocation.
  \item \textbf{Materials.} Symbols replace any Thaisos and Codex requirements.
\end{itemize}
\section{Obligation Capacity}

A character’s \textbf{Obligation Capacity} equals Spirit + Presence.  
Track total Obligation segments across all Patrons (or Symbols, for Invokers).

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Exceeding Capacity:} For each segment above Capacity, mark 1 Fatigue. The character cannot Invoke Rites or perform rituals until Obligation is reduced below Capacity.
  \item \textbf{Resolution:} Reduce Obligation through Downtime service, Patron tasks, ritual cleansing, or story resolution.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} Spirit~2 + Presence~3 = Capacity 5.  
6 segments → Fatigue~1.  
7 segments → Fatigue~2.  
10 segments → Harm~1.  
11 segments → Harm~2.

\subsection*{Obligation Management}
Your debt to Patrons must be managed:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Service}\index{Obligation!service}: Perform tasks fitting your Patron's nature
\item \textbf{Offerings}\index{Obligation!offerings}: Provide sacrifices or tributes
\item \textbf{Propagation}\index{Obligation!propagation}: Spread your Patron's influence or beliefs
\item \textbf{Downtime}\index{Obligation!downtime}: Clear through fitting service during downtime
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Obligation Levels}
\begin{center}
\small
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Segments} & \textbf{Consequences} \\
\midrule
1--2 & Minor attention, subtle signs \\
3--5 & Noticeable influence, regular demands \\
6--8 & Significant control, major tasks required \\
9+   & Dominant influence, potentially dangerous \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Vignette:}

\section{Magical Safety and Ethics} \index{magic!safety} \index{magic!ethics}

Responsible magical practice involves understanding risks and consequences.

\subsection*{Safety Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Containment}\index{safety!containment}: Preventing unintended spread of effects
\item \textbf{Stability}\index{safety!stability}: Ensuring magical effects remain controlled
\item \textbf{Fail-safes}\index{safety!failsafes}: Planning for when magic goes wrong
\item \textbf{Recovery}\index{safety!recovery}: Procedures for dealing with backlash
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Ethical Guidelines}

\item \textbf{Restraint}\index{ethics!restraint}: Using magic judiciously and appropriately
\item \textbf{Responsibility}\index{ethics!responsibility}: Accepting consequences of magical actions
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=purple!5!white,colframe=purple!75!black,title=Magic Quick Reference,fonttitle=\bfseries]
\textbf{Casting (Freeform)}\index{magic!casting}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires Talent: \textbf{Caster's Gift} (2 XP)
\item \textbf{Weave \& Cast}: Two action effect using the Eight Elements
\item \textbf{Backlash}\index{magic!backlash}: Any 1 rolled may cause narrative backlash
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Backlash Severity}\index{magic!backlash}:

\textbf{Rites System}\index{Rites}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Invoke}: 1 action effect
\item \textbf{Obligation}: Mark segments on clock

\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Universal Push It Costs}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Cost Component} & \textbf{Effect} \\ 
\hline
+1 SB & Escalate effect immediately \\ 
+1 Fatigue & Immediate physical/mental strain \\ 
+1 Corruption Clock Segment & Long-term Patron influence (unless otherwise specified) \\ 
GM spends 1 SB & Thematic complication (unless otherwise specified) \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note: Some talents, Rites, or magical paths may specify alternative corruption costs or additional consequences for Push It actions. When explicitly stated, those specific rules override the universal costs.

\paragraph{Clearing Corruption}
Corruption may be reduced through \textit{purging rituals}, such as exorcisms, sacred songs, or rites of contrition. 
These require a test (typically \textbf{Lore + Spirit}) against a DV equal to the character’s current corruption level.  
On success, reduce corruption by 1. On failure, the corruption manifests violently, imposing a temporary Condition or advancing its narrative expression.  

Optional: A \textbf{Story Beat} may also be spent to attempt such a ritual, representing the personal cost of atonement. Patrons may demand specific acts of service, sacrifice, or obligation as part of the purging process.

\textbf{Invoker Path}\index{Invoker}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Symbols} (4 XP each) grant ritual access
\item \textbf{Rituals}: Significant Time, always +1 Obligation
\item \textbf{Crack the Seal}: Instant cast (+2/+3 Obligation)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Safety}\index{magic!safety}: Every roll changes the story. Success without risk is rare.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Practical Magic Examples} \index{examples}

\subsection*{Fire Cast, Partial}
You Weave flame to blind a squad (DV 3). Partial with two 1s. GM spends SB to Position -1 (flare blinds you too) and colors backlash as singed lashes; patrol is alerted (Exposure).

\subsection*{Runekeeper Push and Debt}
You Invoke Circle of Denial [WARD] and Push It to harden the ring. Mark +1 Obligation for the Rite plus +1 for the push. When a demon tests the ring, use [WARD] vs Cap; on its Hit, add +DV to its Leash.

\subsection*{Crack the Seal Under Fire}
You present Ikasha's Symbol and Crack the Seal to lay an instant shadow lane. Symbol $\rightarrow$ Compromised; mark +2 Obligation. GM immediately spends 1 SB to dim all lights (panic), then the lane forms. During downtime, you restore the Symbol (Arcana DV 3): a shaky hit leaves it Neglected until you perform the full rite of cleaning.

\section{Talent: Cantor's Path --- ``Songs of the Low Rites''}
\label{talent:cantors-path}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black!3,colframe=black!40!white,title={Cantor's Path}]
You echo the liturgies of Patrons through breath and string. Not a sworn celebrant but a perilous mimic, you weave Low Rites into song. It is slower, riskier, and beautiful---but never free.
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph*{Type} Minor Talent (10 XP) \quad
\paragraph*{Prerequisites} \textbf{Lore 1+}, \textbf{Performance 2+}, \textbf{Presence 2+} \quad
\paragraph*{Access} Any character (does not require Thiasos membership).

\subsection*{Effect}
You may learn and perform \textbf{Low Rites as Songs}. Each Song counts as knowing the associated Low Rite for performance purposes only.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Casting Test:} \emph{Lore + Performance vs.\ DV} (default DV = 2--3; see \S\ref{talent:cantors-path-dv}).
\item \textbf{Action Economy:} \emph{1 action to begin;} Song \emph{resolves at the start of your next turn} unless accelerated.
\item \textbf{Scope:} \emph{Low Rites only.} Standard/High Rites remain exclusive to Patrons and Thiasos initiates.
\item \textbf{Costs:} Pay any \emph{materials} listed. On success you do \emph{not} mark Obligation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Outcomes}
\begin{description}
\item[Success:] The Low Rite takes effect as written.
\item[Partial:] The Rite manifests with \emph{reduced Effect} (–1 step) or \emph{shortened duration}. Mark \textbf{Fatigue 1}.
\item[Failure:] No effect; mark \textbf{Fatigue 1} and the Keeper gains \textbf{+1 SB (Hearts)}. You \emph{do not} mark Obligation.
\item[Interrupted:] Harm, Silence, or disruption before resolution = treat as Failure.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Push It}
You may Push \emph{when you begin casting}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Song resolves immediately instead of next round.
\item Mark \textbf{Fatigue 1, Corruption 1}.
\item Keeper immediately triggers a \textbf{Story Beat}, representing fallout from a Patron, the Road, or social attention.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Limits \& Interactions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Stacking:} Cannot benefit from the same Rite twice.
\item \textbf{Social Visibility:} Songs are inherently noticeable. On Failure or Push, assume observers take note.
\item \textbf{Silence/Disruption:} Impose \emph{–1 to –3 dice} at Keeper’s discretion.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{DV Guidance}
\label{talent:cantors-path-dv}
\begin{description}
\item[DV 2:] Personal augments, simple glamours.
\item[DV 3:] Zone effects, multi-target edges, time-bending moods.
\item[+1 DV:] Hostile crowds, loud environments, warded spaces.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Perfect Note (Low):} Song resolves next round (DV 3). Push it to resolve immediately, mark +1 Fatigue, and trigger a Story Beat.
\item \textbf{Endless Revel (Low):} Creates revel zone on next turn. Push it to start now with the same costs.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Closing Thought:}
\textbf{Magic}\index{magic} is a powerful tool but never a safe one. Every casting carries risks, and great power always demands great responsibility. Make bold choices—then let the consequences write the next chapter.

\section{Narrative-Heavy Magic Options}

For groups that prefer strong narrative focus in magic use, consider these optional approaches:

\textbf{Intent-Driven Magic:} For minor magical effects that don't significantly alter the story, players can simply declare what they want to accomplish and describe how they do it, without rolling dice. The GM determines if the effect is reasonable and what complications might arise.

\textbf{Collaborative Backlash:} Instead of the GM unilaterally determining backlash, players can suggest thematic consequences that fit the fiction, with GM approval. This makes magic feel more collaborative and story-driven.

\textbf{Ritual as Story Beats:} Major magical workings can be treated as scene-defining moments where the group collaboratively describes what happens, with mechanical effects determined by the narrative impact rather than detailed rolls.

\textbf{Patron Relationships:} Focus on the roleplaying aspects of Patron relationships, treating Obligation as a measure of story tension and character development rather than just a mechanical track to be managed.

\textbf{Magic as Character Development:} Use magical experiences as opportunities for character growth and backstory development, allowing players to narrate how their characters learned new abilities through significant story moments.
