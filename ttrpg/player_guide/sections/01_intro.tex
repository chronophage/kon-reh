\chapter{Welcome to Fate's Edge} \label{ch:intro}

\emph{A world where every choice carries weight, every spell risks backlash, and every legend is written in the shadow of consequence.}

Welcome to \textbf{Fate's Edge}, a tabletop roleplaying game where narrative drives mechanics, and every decision shapes not only your character's path—but the world around them. This is not a game of perfect successes or clean victories. It is a game of risk, drama, and legacy.

\section*{What Is This Game?} \index{game concept}

Fate's Edge is a narrative-first RPG where: \begin{itemize} \item Every roll introduces potential for triumph \emph{and} complication \item Magic is powerful—but dangerous \item Choices ripple outward, shaping character arcs and the setting \item Growth is meaningful, earned through experience spent on skills and assets \end{itemize}

This guide helps you build a character, understand the setting, and step into a world where your actions matter.

\section*{Core Principles} \index{design philosophy}

The game is built on four key ideas:

\begin{description} \item[Narrative First] Mechanics serve the story. Rules reward descriptive play and creative problem-solving. \item[Risk Creates Drama] Every roll carries tension. Even success may come at a cost. \item[Meaningful Growth] Experience is a currency of choice. Invest in yourself or your influence on the world. \item[Consequences Matter] No action is free. Every choice changes the fiction. \end{description}

\section*{Style of Play} \index{tone of play}

Expect cinematic, collaborative storytelling: \begin{itemize} \item Stories driven by character choices \item A world that reacts to your decisions \item Themes of legacy, sacrifice, and moral choices \end{itemize}

Whether you're a lone duelist, a scheming mastermind, or a spirit-touched outlander, your path is yours to forge.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Flavor is Free, fonttitle=\bfseries] \textbf{Players:} Remember that \textbf{flavor is free}!

Add descriptive details, cultural elements, and atmospheric touches without spending resources or requiring rolls. Want to parry with a traditional technique? Go ahead! Want to describe seasonal festivals during a social roll? Perfect!

Flavor enriches the narrative without changing mechanical outcomes. Describe your character's background, customs, or scene details. The Game Master should encourage this and reciprocate.

Mechanics determine success or failure, but flavor determines the story we tell.\end{tcolorbox}
