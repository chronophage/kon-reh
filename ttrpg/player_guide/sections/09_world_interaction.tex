\chapter{World Interaction}
\label{ch:world-interaction}

In \textbf{Fate's Edge}, the world is not a backdrop—it's a partner in the conversation. Dikes groan under black rain in Viterra, clan horns answer across Acasia's ridgelines, Ecktoria's marble halls echo with careful words, and Kahfagia's pilots read storms by taste. Wherever you go, place, culture, and pressure push back.

\section{Game Structure and Time}
\index{Time}\index{Game Structure}

Understanding how time works in Fate's Edge helps you navigate both the mechanical and narrative flow of play.

\subsection*{Basic Units}
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Scene}] \index{Scene} The basic unit of narrative play, covering a specific situation or conflict (Some Time to Significant Time). Resolves a particular question or challenge.
\item[\textbf{Player Turn (Beat)}] \index{Turn} An individual player's action within a scene: Declare action $\rightarrow$ GM sets position $\rightarrow$ roll $\rightarrow$ resolve outcome $\rightarrow$ manage consequences.
\item[\textbf{Round}] \index{Round} Simultaneous or near-simultaneous actions within a scene (primarily for combat), representing a few seconds of real time.
\item[\textbf{Session}] \index{Session} One complete game session (typically 3–6 hours), containing 2–4 major scenes and resolving significant narrative progress.
\item[\textbf{Downtime}] \index{Downtime} The narrative time between scenes, used for recovery, advancement, and off-screen activities. Measured in days, weeks, or months depending on fiction.
\item[\textbf{Campaign}] \index{Campaign} Entire story arc (6–20+ sessions) with major character development and lasting consequences.
\end{description}

\section{Movement and Positioning}
\index{Movement}\index{Position}

Space is tracked with \textbf{range bands} and \textbf{Position}.

\subsection*{Range Bands}
\index{Range}
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Close}] \index{Range!Close} Touching distance: grapples, knife-work, hand on a relic.
\item[\textbf{Near}] \index{Range!Near} Same room/yard/deck; a rush away.
\item[\textbf{Far}] \index{Range!Far} Same site but distant; requires route or time to reach.
\item[\textbf{Absent}] \index{Range!Absent} Off-screen; requires scene change or significant effort to interact.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Movement Actions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Move}: Shift one range band as a \emph{beat}.
\item \textbf{Dash}: Shift two bands as your full action (terrain may require a roll).
\item \textbf{Melee Flag}: Mark when two parties are in Near range and directly engaged in combat.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Position States}
\index{Position!Controlled}\index{Position!Risky}\index{Position!Desperate}
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Controlled}] \index{Position!Controlled} You have cover, leverage, or ritual footing. Failure still leaves options.
\item[\textbf{Risky}] \index{Position!Risky} Standard case: exposed lanes, rivals near, watchful eyes. Failure has teeth, but not ruin.
\item[\textbf{Desperate}] \index{Position!Desperate} Bad ground, bad odds, bad timing. Failure is severe; success may bring extra XP.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Position Shifting:}
\begin{itemize}
\item GM can spend \textbf{1 SB} to worsen Position by one step.
\item Player can spend \textbf{1 Boon} to improve Position by one step (once per action).
\item Narrative triggers (flanking, reinforcements, etc.) can shift Position without cost.
\end{itemize}

\section{Travel Framework}
\index{Travel}\index{Travel Framework}

Travel abstracts distance into \emph{legs} with tension and color rather than miles and meal counts. Each leg has a \textbf{Travel Clock} and draws on a \textbf{regional deck} to seed fiction.

\subsection*{Travel Process}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set the Leg:} Name origin and destination; start a Travel Clock (4-10 segments based on difficulty).
\item \textbf{Draw Prompts:} Draw up to one card from each suit to establish terrain, people, pressures, and leverage.
\item \textbf{Assign Roles:} Players take on travel roles (Guide, Scout, Quartermaster, Watch) to contribute actions.
\item \textbf{Play the Leg:} Players take actions to advance the clock or mitigate complications. GM spends SB from rolls showing \textbf{1}s to introduce hazards.
\item \textbf{Resolve:} When the clock fills, you arrive—changed by the journey.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Using Assets and Followers During Travel}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Assets}: Spend 1 Boon to activate an asset for dramatic effect during travel (reveal hidden path, call for emergency aid, etc.).
\item \textbf{Followers}: Assign followers to travel roles for bonuses. A Cap 3 Scout follower adds +3 to navigation rolls, for example.
\item \textbf{Independent Actions}: Once per travel leg, a follower can take an independent action (scout ahead, secure supplies, etc.) at the cost of Exposure or Harm.
\item \textbf{Off-Screen Solutions}: High-Cap followers (4-5) can solve significant travel problems once per downtime, but generate 1 SB for the party.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Regional Travel Decks}
\index{Travel!regional decks}
Each major region has a themed prompt list or card table (see \S\ref{ch:deck-generators}):
\begin{description}
\item[Viterra] \index{Viterra} Fen causeways, dike-brotherhoods, crown law.
\item[Acasia] \index{Acasia} Border-lace titles, ruined towers, clan tempers.
\item[Ecktoria] \index{Ecktoria} Imperial roads, precinct gates, temple schedules.
\item[Ubral] \index{Ubral} Stone passes, toll-cloisters, ghosted fields.
\item[Kahfagia] \index{Kahfagia} Current maps, pilot-mirrors, storm lanes.
\item[Aelinnel] \index{Aelinnel} Mist paths, bell-mounds, spirit ways.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Travel Complications}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hazards}: Weather, terrain challenges, wildlife encounters.
\item \textbf{Social}: Border checks, local politics, cultural misunderstandings.
\item \textbf{Supplies}: Food shortages, equipment failure, resource management.
\item \textbf{Pursuit}: Being followed, hunted, or racing against time.
\end{itemize}

\section{Narrative Time}
\index{Time!narrative}
Time is measured by \emph{importance} rather than duration.
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{A Moment}] \index{Time!Moment} A glance, a strike, a whisper over a law-stone.
\item[\textbf{Some Time}] \index{Time!Some Time} A skirmish, a negotiation, a careful climb.
\item[\textbf{Significant Time}] \index{Time!Significant Time} Hours of march, rites, audits, stakeouts.
\item[\textbf{Days}] \index{Time!Days} Drills, recoveries, research, roadwork.
\end{description}

\section{Social Interactions}
\index{Social}\index{Culture}
Social scenes use the same engine with \textbf{cultural color}.

\subsection*{Cultural Skill Emphases}
\index{Social!culture}
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Viterra}] \index{Viterra!social} Rapport with parishes; Sway for markets; Command under writ.
\item[\textbf{Acasia}] \index{Acasia!social} Rapport for kin-bridges; Command with banner-rights; Deceive risks honor clocks.
\item[\textbf{Ecktoria}] \index{Ecktoria!social} Sway in salons; Deceive at court; Perform in temple fora.
\item[\textbf{Kahfagia}] \index{Kahfagia!social} Rapport aboard; Sway at piers; Command on a storming deck.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Social Stakes \& Clocks}
\index{Social!stakes}\index{Clocks!social}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Alliance Clock (Viterra):} Parishes and guilds come to your side.
\item \textbf{Honor Clock (Acasia):} Feasts, oaths, wyrd—trust builds (or frays).
\item \textbf{Bureau Clock (Ecktoria):} Stamps, seals, approvals—delay is pressure.
\item \textbf{Trust Clock (Kahfagia):} Pilots and crews extend favors and routes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Supply and Resources}
\label{world:supply}
\index{Supplies}\index{Supply Clock}
Track scarcity with a \textbf{Supply Clock} shared by the party's expedition.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
\toprule
\textbf{Segments} & \textbf{State \& Effects} \\
\midrule
0 (Full) & Well-provisioned; no penalty. \\
2 (Low) & Minor frictions; -1 to resource checks. \\
3 (Dangerous) & Each PC gains \emph{Fatigue 1}. \\
4 (Empty) & Severe penalties; desperate measures. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

subsection{Using Tags}
Tags only function when \emph{printed on a Talent, an Ability, or as the result of a Spell/Rite}. 
They do nothing on their own. 
Unless specified otherwise, \textbf{DV is set by fiction}, and duration defaults to \textbf{Scene}. 
When a Tag affects an \textbf{Outsider}, use the unified rules in \S\ref{sec:tags-outsiders}.

\paragraph{Example: Disabling a Magical Trap (\WARD).}
A magical trap is represented by the \WARD tag. Its Difficulty Value (DV) to disable is usually the same DV used to cast or sustain the ward.

\textbf{Approaches (examples).}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Wits + Arcana}: analyze and unravel the binding.
  \item \textbf{Wits + Tinker}: mechanically bypass the trigger/anchor.
  \item \textbf{Body + Agility}: carefully avoid or physically disarm the trigger.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Position sets DV (Ladder).}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Controlled} (ample time, proper tools, safe access): \textbf{DV 2}.
  \item \textbf{Risky} (under pressure, limited time, partial access): \textbf{DV 3}.
  \item \textbf{Desperate} (activating/compromised access): \textbf{DV 4–5+} (GM sets by threat).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Talents \& Tools.} A relevant Talent or Tool may unlock an alternate approach or grant +1d / +1 Effect; proper tools may improve Position at the GM’s discretion.

\textbf{Outcomes.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Success}: the \WARD is suppressed, bypassed, or its trigger safely disarmed.
  \item \textbf{Partial}: the \WARD is affected but \emph{unstable} or a new complication appears (GM may start/advance a related clock or spend SB for an intrusion).
  \item \textbf{Miss}: the \WARD remains and may trigger; generate SB as complications (backlash, mechanism damage, alarm to the creator, etc.).
\end{itemize}

\section{Engaging the World—Player Actions}
\index{Procedures!world}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Scout \& Signal:} A follower can make the next travel action \emph{Controlled} (mark Exposure or Harm 1 on them).
\item \textbf{Local Color:} Briefly state what locals notice about you; GM offers a small fictional edge \emph{or} a tempting clock—choose.
\item \textbf{Mark the Map:} On arrival, declare one change to the fiction (new ford, patron's shrine, toll-skip). GM may attach a minor clock as cost.
\item \textbf{Asset Activation:} Spend 1 Boon to activate an asset dramatically during a scene.
\item \textbf{Follower Assistance:} Have a follower assist your actions for bonus dice (max +3 from all sources).
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
\index{World interaction!summary}
The world has opinions. Movement is clocks and color, position rises and sinks with weather and words, and every suit you draw speaks in a regional accent. Ask the land for a favor—then pay it back on the road.

\paragraph{Remember:} Every interaction with the world is an opportunity. Use your assets, deploy your followers, and engage with the setting actively. The world responds to your choices, and every journey changes both you and the places you pass through.
