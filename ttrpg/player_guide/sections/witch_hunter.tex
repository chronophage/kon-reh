\index{character concepts!witch hunter}\index{witch hunter}

\textbf{Concept}: A sanctioned tracker of illicit rites and rogue talents. Part detective, part exorcist, part collector of debts owed to the law.

\textbf{Typical Inspiration}: Inquisitors, occult constables, hedge-wardens, contract witch-finders.

\textbf{Mechanical Foundation}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Primary}: Wits 4, Spirit 3
  \item \textbf{Skills}: Investigation 3, Lore (occult) 2, Melee 2, Insight 1 \index{skills!Investigation}\index{skills!Lore}\index{skills!Melee}\index{skills!Insight}
  \item \textbf{Talents}: \emph{Witch-Sign Reader} (spot residue of workings), \emph{Cold Iron Practice} (gain +1d when disrupting active magic), \emph{Calm Under Oath} (resist panic, intimidation once/scene) \index{talents!Witch-Sign Reader}\index{talents!Cold Iron Practice}\index{talents!Calm Under Oath}
  \item \textbf{Assets}: Writ of limited authority (opens doors, closes some), temple archive informant
  \item \textbf{Affiliation}: Choose one order - Chain-Lanterns, Spirit-Shield, Sum-Abjurers, Break-Reins, Silk/Shed Vigil, or Wake-Judges
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Play Style}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Tracks leads, reads scenes, corners quarry with paperwork and steel
  \item Uses Position and leverage in social spaces before blades are drawn
  \item Treats magic as both \emph{evidence} and \emph{hazard} (\S\ref{ch:magic}) \index{magic!forensics}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Development Path}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Specialize in \emph{Baneful Techniques} (counter-rites, bindings)
  \item Build a network of informants and safe cells (\S\ref{ch:assets-followers})
  \item Learn one tradition deeply to turn it against itself
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Story Hooks}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A vanished ledger ties a noble salon to forbidden rites
  \item A \emph{sanction} arrives with no seal—who really wrote it?
  \item Your oldest informant begs you to burn a file with your name on it
\end{itemize}

Once per session when confronting occult evidence, choose one:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Pattern Recognition}: Reduce DV by 1 on first investigation roll
  \item \textbf{Measured Response}: Shift Position one step safer when disrupting active magic
  \item \textbf{Witness Prepared}: Gain +1d on first social roll when presenting authority
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Sanction Ledger} [4]: Tracks cases where you've used authority beyond scope. When full, local magical communities become wary of your presence.
