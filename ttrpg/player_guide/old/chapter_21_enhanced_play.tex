\section{Character Creation Enhancements}
\index{Character creation!enhancements}

\subsection{Enhanced Starting Builds}
\index{Character creation!enhanced builds}

Players may exceed the standard 30 XP build through narrative engagement:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bonds:} Up to two player-defined mutual bonds may be taken for +2 XP total
    \item \textbf{Complications:} Up to two initial complications may be accepted for +4 XP total
\end{itemize}

This allows for a maximum starting build of 34 XP, though players are encouraged to aim for 30 XP and use bonds/complications to mitigate slight overages while maintaining narrative balance.

\subsection{Recommended Approach}
\index{Character creation!recommended approach}

The GM should encourage players to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Target 30 XP for balanced starting characters
    \item Use bonds and complications to enhance characterization rather than pure mechanical optimization
    \item Consider the narrative implications of any starting advantages.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{NOTE:} Scenes start with +1 banked CP per character with initial complications until those complications have cleared.

\section{Downtime}
\index{Downtime}

Between game sessions, players have several important responsibilities to ensure smooth gameplay and character progression. This downtime represents the natural breathing space in your character's adventures where growth, recovery, and planning occur.

\subsection{Bookkeeping}
\index{Downtime!bookkeeping}

Players should complete the following essential tasks before the next session:

\textbf{XP Allocation:} Review all XP earned during the previous session and decide how to spend it on attributes, skills, followers, or assets. Remember that spending XP requires equivalent downtime days.

\textbf{Complication Tracking:} Note any ongoing complications that generate CP debt. Each character with initial complications adds +1 banked CP per scene until cleared.

\textbf{Asset and Follower Management:} Update the status of all assets and followers, noting any changes in their condition or availability.

\textbf{Boon Economy:} Track boons earned and spent, including any conversions to XP (maximum 2 XP per session through boon conversion).

\subsection{Downtime Activities}
\index{Downtime!activities}

During downtime, characters can engage in various activities:

\textbf{Recovery:} Heal from harm, recover from exposure, and restore resources depleted during adventures.

\textbf{Training:} Improve skills or attributes through dedicated practice (requires spending XP and time).

\textbf{Research:} Investigate mysteries, study lore, or develop new capabilities.

\textbf{Social Interaction:} Strengthen bonds, form new relationships, or tend to social assets.

\textbf{Preparation:} Plan for upcoming challenges, craft items, or prepare resources.

\subsection{Strategic Considerations}
\index{Downtime!strategic considerations}

Players should consider several factors during downtime:

\textbf{CP Debt Management:} Characters with complications generate ongoing CP debt that affects the entire party. Prioritizing complication resolution benefits everyone.

\textbf{Resource Planning:} Ensure adequate supplies, equipment, and support for future challenges.

\textbf{Character Development:} Balance immediate needs with long-term character growth.

\textbf{Group Coordination:} Communicate with other players about shared assets, bonds, or coordinated plans.

Remember: Downtime is not just bookkeeping—it's an opportunity to shape your character's story and prepare for future adventures. Use this time wisely, as the consequences of your choices will ripple into upcoming sessions.
