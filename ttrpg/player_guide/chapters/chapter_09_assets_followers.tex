\chapter{Assets and Followers}

In \textbf{Fate’s Edge}, your influence extends beyond your own skills and talents. Through \textbf{Assets} and \textbf{Followers}, you can shape the world off-screen, command allies in battle, and build lasting legacies. But with power comes responsibility—and risk.

\section{Assets}

\textbf{Assets} are off-screen resources that solve problems between sessions. They do not act in scenes directly, but they change the fiction and provide leverage when you return to the table.

\subsection*{Types of Assets}

\begin{description}
  \item[Minor (4 XP)] — Safehouse, small shop, petty title.
  \item[Standard (8 XP)] — Noble title, guild section, spy ring.
  \item[Major (12 XP)] — City license, regional network, fortress lease.
  \item[Tier III (16–20 XP)] — Grand Forge, Harbor Consortium, University College.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Using Assets}

Assets provide off-screen benefits:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Solve logistical problems.
  \item Seed clues or rumors.
  \item Grant +1–2 dice when personally leveraging them on-screen.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activation Cost:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{1 Boon} — Preferred method.
  \item \textbf{2 XP} — Emergency use.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Asset Condition}

All Assets have a \textbf{Condition Track}:

\begin{description}
  \item[Maintained] — Full capability.
  \item[Neglected] — -1 die when used; requires attention.
  \item[Compromised] — Unavailable until repaired or recovered.
\end{description}

\section{Followers}

\textbf{Followers} are on-screen allies who assist in scenes. They are not stat blocks—they are story agents with personalities, goals, and flaws.

\subsection*{Follower Ratings}

Followers are rated by \textbf{Cap} (1–5), which determines their specialty dice and assist bonus.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{clcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Cap} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Cost (XP)} & \textbf{Assist Bonus} \\
\midrule
1 & Competent Assistant & 3 & Up to +1 \\
2 & Trained Specialist & 5 & Up to +2 \\
3 & Veteran Operative & 8 & Up to +3 \\
4 & Elite Aide & 12 & Up to +3 \\
5 & Exceptional Lieutenant & 17 & Up to +3 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Assisting in Scenes}

Followers assist by adding dice to your rolls:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{In-Role Assist} — +Cap bonus when specialty applies.
  \item \textbf{Off-Role Assist} — +1 bonus with an intricate description.
  \item \textbf{Cap Limit} — Maximum assist bonus is +3 per roll.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Follower Condition}

Followers track \textbf{Exposure} and \textbf{Harm}:

\begin{description}
  \item[Exposure] — Heat, attention, or narrative stress.
  \item[Harm] — Injury or trauma.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{States:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Maintained} — Reliable and ready.
  \item \textbf[Neglected] — Needs downtime or care.
  \item \textbf[Compromised] — Captured, defected, or lost.
\end{itemize}

\section{Follower Initiative Actions}

Once per scene (across the crew), one on-screen follower may take a small independent action:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Scout & Signal — Change an ally’s next action position to Controlled.
  \item Distract & Draw — Reduce a kinetic rail (Hunt/Escape/Hazard) by –1 tick.
  \item Fetch & Carry — Move a small object through danger.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cost:} Mark Exposure +1 or Harm 1 on that follower.

\section{Upkeep and Maintenance}

Followers and Assets require upkeep:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Downtime} — Spend Significant Time training or tending.
  \item \textbf{XP Injection} — Pay XP equal to Cap or Tier to keep sharp.
\end{itemize}

Neglected resources degrade. Compromised ones may be lost unless recovered through quests or sacrifice.

\section{Summary}

Assets and Followers are powerful tools—but they come with obligations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Assets solve problems off-screen but require maintenance.
  \item Followers assist in scenes but are vulnerable to Complications.
  \item Both shape the story and reflect your character’s influence.
\end{itemize}

Invest wisely—and be ready to pay the price.
