\chapter{Languages of the Lands}
\label{ch:languages}

In \textbf{Fate's Edge}, language is both \textbf{bridge and barrier}. While most folk speak \textbf{Common}—a dwarven-forged trade tongue—each culture prizes its own tongue, rich with history, poetry, and power. This chapter explores the major languages of the world and how they shape identity, diplomacy, and secrecy.

\section{Common: The Trade Tongue}
