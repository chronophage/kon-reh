\item Request Information using leverage
\item Try Complication Bargaining with GM
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building Skills (Sessions 4-6)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use Clock Manipulation strategically
\item Earn Cultural Immersion Bonuses
\item Recognize Faction Loyalty patterns
\item Participate in Momentum Banking
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Master Level (Sessions 7+)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Strategic Cross-Deck Synergy creation
\item Advanced Escalation Management
\item Collaborative Resource Trading
\item Leadership in Session Investment
\end{itemize}

These enhanced player mechanics transform you from passive participants to active co-creators of the narrative, with meaningful resources to manage and strategic choices that shape the story.

\subsection{Enhanced Starting Builds}
Players may exceed the standard 30 XP build through narrative engagement:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bonds:} Up to two player-defined mutual bonds may be taken for +2 XP total (Section \ref{sessionawards})
    \item \textbf{Complications:} Up to two initial complications may be accepted for +4 XP total (Section \ref{sessionawards})
\end{itemize}

This allows for a maximum starting build of 34 XP, though players are encouraged to aim for 30 XP and use bonds/complications to mitigate slight overages while maintaining narrative balance.

\subsection{Recommended Approach}
The GM should encourage players to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Target 30 XP for balanced starting characters
    \item Use bonds and complications to enhance characterization rather than pure mechanical optimization
    \item Consider the narrative implications of any starting advantages
\end{itemize}
