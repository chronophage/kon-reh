\chapter{Talents}

In \textbf{Fate's Edge}, \textbf{Talents} are unique abilities that expand what your character can do. They are purchased with XP and often serve as stepping stones toward Prestige Abilities. Talents can be general, cultural, or narrative capstones that reshape how you engage with the world.

\section{Types of Talents}

Talents are organized into three categories based on cost and impact:

\subsection*{General Talents}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Battle Instincts} (Cost: 6 XP): Once per scene, re-roll a failed defense roll.
    \item \textbf{Silver Tongue} (Cost: 4 XP): Gain +1 die when persuading or deceiving through speech.
    \item \textbf{Iron Stomach} (Cost: 3 XP): Immune to mundane poisons and spoiled food; halve Complications from toxic sources.
    \item \textbf{Exceptional Coordination} (Cost: 8 XP): One follower can provide +4 assist dice.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Racial or Cultural Talents}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stone-Sense} (Dwarves, Cost: 5 XP): Detect flaws in stone or earth; gain +1 die on Engineering or Craft rolls underground.
    \item \textbf{Backlash Soothing} (Wood Elves, Cost: 6 XP): Once per session, reduce a magical Backlash Complication by 2 points when in natural terrain.
    \item \textbf{Blood Memory} (Ykrul, Cost: 5 XP): After a battle, meditate to gain one temporary Skill die reflecting a foe's tactics for the next scene.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Prestige Abilities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Echo-Walker's Step} (High Elf, Cost: 20 XP; Req: Wits 5, Arcana 4): 
1/arc, \emph{observe} a perfect echo of a past event at your location (no retconning). 
GM immediately banks +2 CP; scenes touching that memory carry an omen. Grants DV −1 on one action that uses the revealed truth.
    \item \textbf{Warglord} (Ykrul, Cost: 18 XP; Req: Body 5, Command 3): 
Once per campaign, unify scattered warbands into a single host for a season. Start a \emph{Logistics} clock and a \emph{Grudge} clock; either one filling fractures the host.
    \item \textbf{Spirit-Shield} (Aeler, Cost: 15 XP; Req: Spirit 4, Insight 3): 
1/session, erase up to 3 CP from an ally's \emph{current} roll; you immediately mark Fatigue +1 and the GM banks +1 CP as backlash.
\end{itemize}

\section{Purchasing Talents}

Talents are purchased with XP and may have prerequisites:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Attribute/Skill Requirements} — Must meet minimum ratings (permanent, not temporary).
  \item \textbf{Asset Requirements} — Some Talents require ownership of specific assets.
  \item \textbf{Cultural Requirements} — Certain Talents are restricted to specific cultures or Affinities.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} \textit{Echo-Walker's Step} requires Wits 5, Arcana 4, and High Elf Affinity.

\section{Prestige Prerequisites}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Qualifying: Attribute/Skill prerequisites must be met with permanent ratings.
    \item After purchase: If you later lose the Asset prerequisite, you keep the Talent but cannot activate features that require that Asset until restored.
    \item Scaling: Many abilities can be enhanced with additional XP investment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Using Talents}

Talents are typically used once per scene, session, or arc, as noted in their description. Overuse is restricted to prevent imbalance.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Once per Scene} — Can be used multiple times per session, but not on the same action.
  \item \textbf{Once per Session} — Limited to one use between downtimes.
  \item \textbf{Once per Arc/Campaign} — Reserved for narrative milestones.
\end{itemize}

\section{Losing Talent Access}

If you later lose a prerequisite (e.g., an Attribute is reduced or an Asset is lost), you \textbf{keep the Talent} but may not be able to use features that require that prerequisite until it is restored.

\section{Summary}

Talents are the unique expressions of your character's growth:

\begin{itemize}
  \item General Talents offer reliable mechanical benefits.
  \item Cultural Talents reflect your heritage and specialized training.
  \item Prestige Abilities reshape the story at key moments.
\end{itemize}

Choose Talents that reflect your character's journey—and let them echo through the world.
