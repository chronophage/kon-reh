\chapter{Magic \& The Arts}

In \textbf{Fate’s Edge}, magic is not a tool of convenience—it is a dangerous negotiation with the fabric of reality. Every spell is a story beat, and every casting carries risk. This chapter introduces the \textbf{Casting Loop}, magical Backlash, and the thematic power of the Arts.

\section{Philosophy of Magic}

Magic in Fate’s Edge is:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Powerful} — It can reshape the battlefield, the story, or the world.
  \item \textbf{Risky} — Every spell generates Complication Points (CP), which manifest as Backlash.
  \item \textbf{Thematic} — Effects and consequences align with the Art invoked (fire, shadow, storm, etc.).
\end{itemize}

Magic is not about stacking damage—it’s about shifting the narrative.

\section{The Casting Loop}

All spellcasting follows a structured sequence called the \textbf{Casting Loop}. It unfolds in two phases:

\subsection*{1. Channel}

Roll \textbf{Wits + Arcana} to gather \textbf{Potential}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Each \textbf{Success} becomes a point of Potential.
  \item Each \textbf{1 rolled} generates a Complication Point immediately.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Weave}

On your next turn, roll \textbf{Wits + (Art)} to shape the spell.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \textbf{Description Ladder} applies: Intricate actions reroll 1s and may add a flourish.
  \item The spell’s effect is determined by successes and the GM’s interpretation of position and effect.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Backlash}

Any Complication Points generated during the Casting Loop are spent by the GM as \textbf{Backlash}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Backlash is \textbf{thematic}—aligned with the Art used.
  \item Severity scales with the number of CP spent.
\end{itemize}

\section{Backlash Severity Table}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
\toprule
\textbf{CP Spent} & \textbf{Typical Consequence} \\
\midrule
1–2 & Minor nuisance or tell (noise, fatigue, brief distraction) \\
3–4 & Noticeable setback (hazard clock, condition, new pressure) \\
5+ & Major turn (scene shift, new foe, severe condition) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Common Magical Arts}

Each Art has its own flavor and risk. Below are examples:

\begin{description}
  \item[Pyromancy] — Fire and heat. Backlash: burns, smoke, uncontrolled spread.
  \item[Umbramancy] — Shadow and silence. Backlash: whispers, self-blindness, entities take notice.
  \item[Geomancy] — Stone and structure. Backlash: rigidity, slow movement, guardians awaken.
  \item[Hydromancy] — Water and flow. Backlash: stagnation, flooding, pests drawn.
  \item[Vitalism] — Life and healing. Backlash: overgrowth, exhaustion, sympathetic drain.
  \item[Thaumaturgy] — Divine or holy magic. Backlash: flickering sanctity, beacon effects, spiritual fatigue.
\end{description}

\section{Ritual Casting (Optional Rule)}

For greater effects, multiple casters can join in a \textbf{Ritual}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Up to \textbf{3 helpers} may assist (based on Arcana/2, max 3).
  \item Helpers roll \textbf{Spirit + Relevant Skill} (Lore, Choir, Craft, etc.).
  \item Each success adds +1 Potential.
  \item Each 1 rolled adds to the shared CP pool.
\end{itemize}

Rituals increase the ceiling of magic—but also the risk. Backlash severity increases with each helper beyond the first.

\section{Spell Design Guidelines}

When creating new spells, follow this format:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Name \& Art} — e.g., Cinder-Fist (Pyromancy)
  \item \textbf{Effect} — One clear narrative change: start Controlled, +1 effect, Hazard –1, etc.
  \item \textbf{Backlash Ladder} — 1–2 CP = minor cost; 3–4 CP = pressure; 5+ CP = scene twist.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Example Spell: Cloak of Shadows}

\begin{description}
  \item[Art] Umbramancy
  \item[DV] 2
  \item[Effect] In dim or darker light, target starts Controlled vs sight-based detection.
  \item[Backlash]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 1 CP — Slight self-blindness (–1 die on sight checks).
      \item 2 CP — Whispering shadows create a faint tell.
      \item 3 CP — You borrow light from elsewhere, leaving a conspicuously bright patch.
      \item 4+ CP — A shadow-being takes interest.
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\section{Summary}

Magic in Fate’s Edge is never “safe.” Every casting:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Advances the story.
  \item Risks Backlash.
  \item Requires a cost—whether in CP, Fatigue, or narrative tension.
\end{itemize}

Embrace the risk—and let the Arts reshape the world.
