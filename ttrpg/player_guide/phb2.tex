\chapter{Core Mechanics} \label{ch:core}

In this game, every action matters. The dice don't just tell you if you succeed—they shape the story by introducing tension, risk, and consequence. Fate's Edge is designed to keep the story moving forward, even when things go wrong. This chapter covers the core resolution system and how every roll changes the narrative.

\section*{Basic Dice Mechanics} \index{dice mechanics}

When you attempt a significant action, you roll a pool of ten-sided dice (d10s). The size of your pool is determined by two factors:
$$\text{Dice Pool} = \text{Attribute} + \text{Skill}$$

\textbf{Attribute} (1--5) Broad traits like strength, wit, or charm.

\textbf{Skill} (0--5) Training or expertise in a specific area.

\subsection*{Reading the Dice}

Each die that rolls 6 or higher counts as a \textbf{Success}. Each die that rolls a 1 generates a \textbf{Story Beat (SB)}.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Die Result} & \textbf{Effect} \\
\hline
6--10 & +1 Success \\
1 & +1 Story Beat (SB) \\
2--5 & No effect \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Example:} Lyra the rogue has Agility 3 and Stealth 2. Her dice pool is 5 dice. She rolls: 6, 4, 3, 1, 6. That gives her 2 Successes and 1 Story Beat. The GM sets the Difficulty Value at 2. Lyra succeeds at sneaking past the guards, but the GM now has 1 SB to spend—perhaps the guards hear something faintly and become suspicious.

\section*{The Description Ladder} \index{description ladder}

Players can enhance their actions through detailed descriptions, which can reduce Story Beats generated by 1s:

\begin{description}
\item[Basic Action] Roll the pool as-is. All 1s remain as Story Beats.
\item[Detailed Action] A clear, descriptive flourish allows the player to re-roll one die showing 1.
\item[Intricate Action] A richly described, multi-sensory action allows the player to re-roll all dice showing 1, and add one positive narrative flourish to the scene if they succeed.
\end{description}

\textbf{Rule:} Re-rolling 1s does not remove the Story Beats already generated by those dice. If any re-rolled dice show 1 again, they generate additional SB as normal.

\section*{Difficulty Value (DV)} \index{Difficulty Value (DV)}

Before rolling, the Game Master sets a \textbf{Difficulty Value (DV)}—the target number of Successes needed.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{DV} & \textbf{Situation} & \textbf{Example} \\
\hline
2 & Routine action, no pressure & Clear intent, modest stakes \\
3 & Pressured, mild opposition & Time pressure, partial information \\
4 & Difficult, active resistance & Hostile conditions, precise timing \\
5+ & Extreme, high stakes & Multiple constraints, dramatic failure potential \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Tip for Players:} A DV of 3 is the most common challenge. Assume that if the GM asks you to roll, there is something at stake—whether it is your safety, your resources, or your reputation.

\section*{Outcome Matrix} \index{outcome matrix}

Compare your Successes against the DV:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Outcome} & \textbf{Effect} \\
\hline
Clean Success & Goal achieved cleanly \\
Success \& Cost & Goal achieved with complication \\
Partial & Progress but with difficult choice \\
Miss & No progress; complication occurs \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Let $S$ be successes and $C$ be SB generated.

\begin{description}
\item[Clean Success] $(S \geq DV \text{ and } C = 0)$ — Deliver the intent crisply.
\item[Success \& Cost] $(S \geq DV \text{ and } C > 0)$ — Grant the intent; the GM spends or banks SB to add friction.
\item[Partial] $(0 < S < DV)$ — Progress with a complication: achieve the goal with added cost, or fail forward to a different advantage.
\item[Miss] $(S = 0)$ — No direct progress. The GM spends or banks SB to introduce immediate consequences.
\end{description}

\textbf{Player-Facing Example:} A fighter swings her sword to disarm a bandit. She rolls 3 Successes against DV 2—a Clean Success. The bandit's blade clatters away. Later, the same fighter tries to kick down a reinforced door with 4 dice against DV 4. She rolls only 2 Successes. This is a Partial. She cracks the door frame, but the noise attracts attention. The story moves forward either way.

\section*{Boons} \index{Boons}

Boons are narrative currency that players can spend to influence the story in their favor. You can hold up to 5 Boons at a time.

\subsection*{Earning Boons}

You gain Boons through:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Partial Success:} When you achieve a Partial outcome (successes $<$ DV but $> 0$), you gain 1 Boon
\item \textbf{Missed Actions:} When you miss entirely (0 successes), you gain 2 Boons
\item \textbf{Bond-Driven Actions:} When you take an Intricate action that meaningfully engages a character bond, you may gain 1 Boon (once per bond per session)
\item \textbf{GM Award:} The GM may award Boons for creative solutions, spotlighting bonds, or meaningful sacrifices
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Requirements for Action Awards}

Boons from Partial/miss outcomes are awarded only if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Procedure was followed correctly (intent declared, DV set, roll resolved)
\item Stakes were clearly stated (what changes on success/failure)
\item Consequence actually occurs (GM spends or banks SB, applies condition, or advances thread)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Important Note:} Rehearsal/null-risk probes and repeated identical attempts in the same scene do not award Boons. If it feels like an obvious fishing attempt, don't award a Boon.

\subsection*{Spending Boons}

You can spend Boons to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Re-roll a single die in a pool
\item Activate an on-screen Asset
\item Power a Rite or magical ability
\item Improve Position by 1 step
\item Convert to XP (2 Boons = 1 XP, once per session during downtime, max 2 XP via conversion per session)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Carryover Limits}

At the end of each scene, reduce held Boons to a maximum of 2. Excess Boons are lost. This encourages you to spend them rather than hoard.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Why This Matters, fonttitle=\bfseries]
The system rewards engagement with risk. Even when you don't fully succeed, you gain resources to help push the story forward. Failures become opportunities, and partial successes still offer chances to turn the tide.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Story Beats (SB)} \index{Story Beats (SB)}

Story Beats are narrative tools the Game Master uses to introduce twists and tension. They keep the story alive with complications and surprises.

\subsection*{What SB Can Do}

The GM may spend SB to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce new threats or complications
\item Drain resources (time, gear, position)
\item Reveal hidden dangers
\item Cause collateral damage
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{SB Spend Examples}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline
\textbf{SB Cost} & \textbf{Effect} \\
\hline
1 SB & Minor complication, noise, trace \\
2 SB & Moderate setback, alarm raised \\
3 SB & Serious trouble, reinforcements arrive \\
4+ SB & Major turn, scene shifts dramatically \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Player Advice:} Don't fear Story Beats—they're not punishment. They are fuel for drama, ensuring the spotlight never dims.

\section*{Harm and Fatigue} \index{Harm and Fatigue}

Physical injury and exhaustion are tracked through two systems:

\subsection*{Fatigue Track}

Each character has a Fatigue Track equal to their Body attribute. Mark Fatigue for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Physical exertion
\item Magical strain
\item Travel stress
\item Mental pressure
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{When your Fatigue Track fills:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Increase your Harm level by one step
\item Clear all Fatigue marks
\end{enumerate}

This can happen multiple times in a scene.

\subsection*{Harm Levels}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Harm Level} & \textbf{Effects} \\
\hline
Harm 1 & -1 die on related actions \\
Harm 2 & -1 die on most actions until treated \\
Harm 3 & Incapacitated or dying \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Recovering Fatigue}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Short Rest} — Remove 2 Fatigue with food/water
\item \textbf{Full Night} — Remove all Fatigue
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Recovering Harm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Minor treatment} — Downgrade Harm with time/rest
\item \textbf{Proper medical care} — Remove Harm levels
\item \textbf{Extended recovery} — Heal severe injuries
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} Jorin the mercenary takes a sword cut (Harm 1). He suffers -1 die to physical actions until treated. After binding the wound and resting, the Harm fades.

\section*{Assistance} \index{Assistance}

Characters can help each other. One helper per action may provide assistance by spending 1 Boon or 1 Stress, adding +1 die to the primary actor's roll. Maximum +3 dice from assists.

\textbf{Example:} Two thieves cooperate to pick a complex lock. The lead thief has Dexterity 3 + Tools 2 = 5 dice. The helper spends 1 Boon to add 1 die, making 6. Cooperation often turns failure into tense success.

\section*{Weapons \& Armor} \index{Weapons}

\subsection*{Weapons by Weight Class}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Light (4 XP)} — fast, concealable.
\item \textbf{Medium (8 XP)} — balanced, battlefield standard.
\item \textbf{Heavy (12 XP)} — punishing, slow.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Melee Modifiers}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Weight} & \textbf{Close} & \textbf{Near} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\hline
Light & +2d & +1d & Quick, tight quarters \\
Medium & +1d & +2d & Set 1/scene or –1d first attack \\
Heavy & –1d & +3d & Set 1/scene or –2d first attack \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Ranged \& Tempo}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Weight} & \textbf{Tempo} & \textbf{Close} & \textbf{Near} & \textbf{Far} \\
\hline
Light (4 XP) & Fast & Risky & +1d & — \\
Medium (8 XP) & Standard & Desperate & +2d & +1d \\
Heavy (12 XP) & Slow & Desperate & +1d & +3d \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Tempo:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Fast = Move+Shoot. 
\item Standard = Move or Shoot, Aim +1d/Effect. 
\item Slow = Set/Brace, full reload, cannot Move+Shoot.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Weapon Tags (Optional, +4 XP each, max 2)}

Reach, Close, Accurate, Brutal, Hook, Concealable, Quickdraw, Two-Handed, Off-Hand.

\subsection*{Shields (Optional)}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Shield} & \textbf{XP} & \textbf{Benefit} & \textbf{Tradeoff} \\
\hline
Buckler & 4 & +1d Defend vs melee or +1 DV & Off-hand \\
Heater & 8 & +1d Defend; 1 Harm→Fatigue & –1d Ranged \\
Pavise & 12 & Plant: heavy cover cone & Bulky, immobile \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Armor}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Armor} & \textbf{XP} & \textbf{Conversion} & \textbf{Penalty} \\
\hline
Light & 4 & 1 Harm→1 Fatigue & — \\
Medium & 8 & 2 Harm→1 Fatigue & –1d physical \\
Heavy & 12 & 3 Harm→2 Fatigue & –2d physical, no sprint \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Notes:} Conversion applies per Harm instance before Fatigue is marked. You may still Resist first.

\subsection*{Condition \& Upkeep}

\begin{description}
\item[Neglected] Weapons –1d; Armor: conversion worsens by 1 step.
\item[Compromised] Weapons –1d first attack/round; Armor: no conversion.
\end{description}

\textbf{Fix:} Short Rest/tools remove Neglected. A scene/Smith removes Compromised.

\section*{Ranged Options} \index{Ranged Options}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Aim:} +1d or +1 Effect.
\item \textbf{Volley:} Extra ammo +1d (max +2).
\item \textbf{Suppress:} Zone fire, foes –1d/Limited Effect.
\item \textbf{Overwatch:} Ready a Risky shot on trigger.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Assets and Allies} \index{Assets}

Your character's resources, contacts, or gear—called Assets—can tilt the odds in your favor.

\begin{description}
\item[On-Screen Assets] — Companions, hirelings, or allies who stand beside you in danger
\item[Off-Screen Assets] — Taverns, estates, titles, or networks of informants
\item[Activation] — Spend 1 Boon to activate an on-screen Asset
\end{description}

\textbf{Narrative Use:} Assets are more than bonuses—they're hooks for roleplay. A friendly tavernkeeper, a noble's signet, or a trusty horse might tip the balance at the perfect moment.

\section*{Game Structure} \index{Game Structure}

\subsection*{Time Scales}

\begin{description}
\item[Moment] A heartbeat, a single action
\item[Some Time] A few minutes, a short activity
\item[Significant Time] Hours, extended effort
\item[Days] Large-scale endeavors
\end{description}

\subsection*{Game Units}

\begin{description}
\item[Scene] Basic narrative unit, covers specific conflict
\item[Player Turn] Individual action within a scene
\item[Round] Simultaneous actions in combat
\item[Session] One game session (3–6 hours)
\item[Campaign] Entire story arc
\end{description}

\textbf{Player Perspective:} Think in scenes, not minutes. Every scene is a chance to shine. Every session builds toward the long arc of your campaign.

\section*{Action Resolution Steps} \index{Action Resolution Steps}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe your intent and method
\item Build dice pool: Attribute + Skill (+ gear, assists)
\item Roll d10s, count Successes and Story Beats
\item Compare Successes to DV
\item Apply outcome from matrix
\item Game Master spends SB if applicable
\item Earn Boons for failure.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Quick Reference, fonttitle=\bfseries]
\textbf{Dice Pool:} Attribute + Skill d10s\\
\textbf{Success:} 6+ on each die\\
\textbf{Setback:} 1 on any die gives SB to GM\\
\textbf{DV:} 2 (easy) to 5+ (extreme)\\
\textbf{Harm:} 3-level system with penalties\\
\textbf{Boons:} 2 on miss, 1 on partial
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Narrative Suggestions} \index{Narrative Suggestions}

\textbf{Collaborative Scene Framing:} Players may suggest scene elements (weather, NPC reactions, environmental details) that fit the established fiction, with GM approval.

\textbf{Intent-Driven Resolution:} For non-combat actions where success is reasonably assured, the GM may ask players to describe \emph{how} they accomplish their goal rather than rolling dice.

\textbf{Flashback Declarations:} Players can declare a flashback scene to establish that something happened in the past (acquiring an item, making a connection, learning information) by spending 1 Boon and describing the scene.

\textbf{Descriptive Assistance:} Players can assist each other by providing vivid, helpful descriptions of the action, granting a +1 die bonus to the primary actor's roll.

\textbf{Proactive Storytelling:} Players can suggest minor favorable details about their character's circumstances by:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introducing a minor NPC who provides useful information or assistance
\item Establishing that they have a useful item on hand (within reason)
\item Creating a favorable environmental detail
\end{itemize}

These suggestions are subject to GM approval and should enhance rather than overshadow the main narrative.

\chapter{Character Advancement} \label{ch:advancement}

In this game, growth isn't just about numbers—it's about defining who your character becomes. Advancement through Experience Points (XP) lets you shape your capabilities, influence, and legacy in the world. Every choice you make with XP is a statement about your character's priorities and the mark they leave behind.

\section*{Earning Experience Points} \index{Experience Points}

XP represents learning through action. You earn it by engaging meaningfully with the world and its challenges, whether that's by triumph, failure, or bold experimentation.

\subsection*{Session Breakdown}

At the end of each session, the Game Master awards XP based on:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Base Participation:} +2 XP for attending and contributing
\item \textbf{Major Objectives:} +2–4 XP for completing significant story goals
\item \textbf{Discoveries:} +1–2 XP for uncovering important lore, locations, or secrets
\item \textbf{Difficult Choices:} +1–2 XP for making hard moral or strategic decisions
\item \textbf{Story Engagement:} +1–3 XP for embracing complications and narrative twists
\item \textbf{Personal Goals:} +1–2 XP for pursuing your character's individual storylines
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} At the end of a session, the party rogue earns +2 XP for participation, +2 XP for helping the group retrieve an artifact, and +1 XP for pushing a personal rivalry subplot—5 XP total.

\subsection*{Game Pace Options}

The GM can adjust advancement speed to match the campaign tone:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Mode} & \textbf{XP/Session} & \textbf{Tone} \\
\hline
Gritty & 4–6 XP & Hard choices, slow growth \\
Standard & 6–10 XP & Balanced progression \\
Epic & 10–14 XP & Heroic, rapid development \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Player Tip:} If you want a sweeping, mythic tale, suggest an Epic pace. For a long, hard road where each gain feels hard-earned, lean into Gritty.

\subsection*{Arc Completion Bonus}

When you finish a major story arc (typically 3–6 sessions), everyone receives +8–12 XP. One player may earn an additional +2 XP for a particularly memorable contribution. This celebrates the story's milestones, not just individual rolls.

\section*{Spending Experience Points} \index{Experience Points!spending}

XP is your currency for growth. You can invest it in three broad areas, each representing a different approach to becoming more capable.

\subsection*{1. Personal Improvement}

Invest in your core capabilities—what you can do yourself.

\textbf{Attributes} Cost = New Rating × 3 XP
\begin{itemize}
\item Raising Body from 2 to 3 costs 3 × 3 = 9 XP
\item Raising Spirit from 4 to 5 costs 5 × 3 = 15 XP
\item Requires downtime equal to new rating in days
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Skills} Cost = New Level × 2 XP
\begin{itemize}
\item Improving Lore from 1 to 2 costs 2 × 2 = 4 XP
\item Advancing Melee from 3 to 4 costs 4 × 2 = 8 XP
\item Requires downtime equal to new level in days
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} Kara wants to improve her Swordsmanship from 2 to 3. She saves 6 XP and spends three in-game days training with her mentor. This creates roleplay hooks and a sense of lived growth.

\subsection*{2. Resources and Influence}

Build your worldly presence—what you can command.

\begin{description}
\item[Minor Resource (4 XP, 1 week)] — Small shop, minor contact network, basic workshop. Provides small but reliable benefits. Example: A trusted informant who gathers rumors
\item[Standard Resource (8 XP, 2 weeks)] — Decent-sized business, skilled followers, specialized equipment. Significant benefits with some upkeep. Example: A smuggling operation with two boats
\item[Major Resource (12 XP, 1 month)] — Large enterprise, elite team, rare capabilities. Powerful advantages with substantial upkeep. Example: A trading company with international contacts
\end{description}

\textbf{Player Tip:} Resources expand the story into new directions. A spy network creates intrigue; a workshop sparks invention; a guild hall cements influence.

\subsection*{3. Special Abilities}

Develop unique capabilities that set you apart.

\begin{description}
\item[General Abilities (Cost varies)] — Universal benefits like improved recovery, bonus dice in specific situations, or unique combat techniques. Typically cost 4–8 XP. Example: "Quick Recovery" - heal 1 additional Harm when resting
\item[Cultural Abilities (Cost varies)] — Heritage-based skills tied to your character's background. Often require specific fictional positioning. Example: "Stone Sense" (dwarven) - intuitive understanding of stonework
\item[Advanced Abilities (12+ XP)] — Powerful capstone features available at higher tiers. Often have significant narrative weight and requirements. Example: "Master Diplomat" - can reroll failed social checks once per session
\end{description}

\textbf{Example:} A veteran bard invests in "Silver Tongue" (6 XP), allowing them to sway hostile crowds once per session. This becomes their defining trick in tense negotiations.

\section*{Character Development Paths} \index{Character Development Paths}

Your spending choices define your character's growth direction. Consider these archetypal paths:

\subsection*{The Specialist}

70–90\% personal improvement, 0–10\% resources, 0–20\% abilities
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Strengths:} Exceptional individual capability, reliable in spotlight moments
\item \textbf{Weaknesses:} Limited influence, vulnerable to being isolated
\item \textbf{Best for:} Solo operatives, elite warriors, master artisans
\item \textbf{Example:} A duelist who invests heavily in combat skills and physical attributes
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Leader}

50–65\% personal, 15–25\% resources, 15–25\% abilities
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Strengths:} Well-rounded, can handle diverse challenges, good support
\item \textbf{Weaknesses:} Jack-of-all-trades, not exceptional in any area
\item \textbf{Best for:} Party faces, field commanders, investigators
\item \textbf{Example:} A merchant-prince with decent combat skills, good social abilities, and a network of contacts
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Mastermind}

25–40\% personal, 35–55\% resources, 20–40\% abilities
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Strengths:} Extensive influence, can solve problems indirectly, strategic power
\item \textbf{Weaknesses:} Personally vulnerable, complex upkeep, domino-effect risks
\item \textbf{Best for:} Spymasters, crime lords, wealthy patrons
\item \textbf{Example:} An information broker with modest personal skills but an extensive spy network
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Player Note, fonttitle=\bfseries]
These are not rigid templates. Mix and match to discover unique growth arcs.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Training and Development Time} \index{Training Time}

Most improvements require downtime to reflect the effort of learning and integration.

\subsection*{Standard Time Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item Attribute increase: New rating in days
\item Skill improvement: New level in days
\item Resource acquisition: 1 week to 1 month depending on scope
\item Ability learning: Typically 3–10 days
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Accelerated Development}

You can attempt to learn things more quickly, but this carries risks:
\begin{itemize}
\item The GM creates a Risk Clock with 4 segments
\item If the clock fills during rushed training, the new capability has flaws:
\begin{itemize}
\item Attribute/Skill: -1 die penalty until you spend proper downtime
\item Resource: Loyalty problems or functional limitations
\item Ability: Unreliable or with unintended side effects
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} The wizard crams advanced spellwork into a frantic three days. She gains the ability, but her Risk Clock fills—her spells now sputter unpredictably until she retrains.

\section*{Character Progression Tiers} \index{Character Progression Tiers}

As you accumulate XP and capabilities, you advance through tiers that represent your growing reputation and influence.

\subsection*{Tier I: Novice (0–40 XP)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Learning the ropes, establishing yourself
\item Local reputation, modest capabilities
\item Typical assets: Basic equipment, a few contacts
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Tier II: Experienced (41–90 XP)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Proven capability, recognized skills
\item Regional reputation, reliable in your specialty
\item Typical assets: Skilled followers, specialized equipment
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Tier III: Veteran (91–150 XP)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Master of your craft, significant influence
\item National reputation, can handle major challenges
\item Typical assets: Multiple operations, elite teams
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Tier IV: Elite (151–220 XP)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Exceptional capability, major influence
\item International reputation, shapes events
\item Typical assets: Organizations, unique capabilities
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Tier V: Master (221+ XP)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Legendary status, world-changing influence
\item Historical reputation, defines eras
\item Typical assets: Nations, legendary artifacts
\end{itemize}

\section*{Managing Allies and Followers} \index{Followers}

Characters who work with you require maintenance and carry risks.

\subsection*{Acquisition Costs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Skilled helper: Capability rating squared in XP
\item Example: A capability 3 scout costs 9 XP
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Upkeep Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item Each downtime period, spend XP equal to their capability rating
\item Alternative: Dedicate a scene to maintaining the relationship
\end{itemize}

\section*{Strategic Advancement Considerations} \index{Advancement Strategy}

\subsection*{Early Game (Tiers I–II)}

Focus on survival and establishing your niche:
\begin{itemize}
\item Invest in core competencies first
\item Build a small but reliable support network
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Mid Game (Tier III)}

Expand your influence and specialize:
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop your signature capabilities
\item Build substantial resources
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Late Game (Tiers IV–V)}

Shape the world around you:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pursue advanced abilities
\item Build organizations or movements
\item Leave a legacy
\end{itemize}

\section*{Advancement Philosophy} \index{Advancement Philosophy}

Remember that advancement serves the story. The best choices:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reflect your character's experiences and growth
\item Create interesting new capabilities and complications
\item Enhance the group's collective abilities
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Final Thought, fonttitle=\bfseries]
Every XP spent changes not just your character sheet, but your character's story. Choose investments that make your hero more interesting to play and watch evolve.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=XP Planning Guide, fonttitle=\bfseries]
\textbf{Early Tier Priorities:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Core attribute to 3 (9 XP)
\item Key skills to 2–3 (4–8 XP each)
\item 1–2 minor resources (8 XP total)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mid Tier Expansion:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Attributes to 4 (12 XP)
\item Specialization skills to 4 (8 XP)
\item Standard resources (8 XP each)
\item Cultural abilities (6–10 XP)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Late Tier Mastery:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Capstone abilities (12+ XP)
\item Major resources (12 XP)
\item Legacy projects
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Narrative-Heavy Advancement Options} \index{Narrative-Heavy Gameplay!Advancement}

For groups that prefer strong narrative focus in advancement, consider these optional approaches:

\textbf{Story-Driven Milestones:} Instead of tracking XP numerically, the GM can award advancement when characters reach significant story milestones. "You've trained with the master for months—you've improved your skill."

\textbf{Experience Through Reflection:} Players can spend downtime scenes reflecting on past experiences to earn XP. A meaningful flashback or character moment can justify growth without tracking specific points.

\textbf{Collaborative Advancement:} The group can discuss and agree on advancement choices, ensuring everyone's growth supports the overall story direction.

\textbf{Narrative Justification Focus:} When spending XP, players should explain how their character gained this capability through in-game experiences, creating richer backstory and continuity.

\chapter{Magic and Special Abilities} \label{ch:magic}

Magic in this game is powerful but dangerous—a negotiation with reality itself that always carries risks. This chapter covers the core magical systems: standard spellcasting, ritual magic, and special pact-based abilities. Throughout, look for examples and player-facing tips to keep the fiction front and center.

\section*{The Nature of Magic} \index{magic!nature}

Magic is not a safe tool but a dangerous force:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Powerful:} Can reshape battles, stories, or even the world
\item \textbf{Risky:} Every use generates Story Beats (SB) that manifest as backlash
\item \textbf{Thematic:} Effects and consequences align with the type of magic used
\item \textbf{Volatile:} Never fully predictable or controllable
\item \textbf{Narrative:} Casting is always a significant story moment
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Table Vignette, fonttitle=\bfseries]
"I can hold the avalanche," says Mira, fingers trembling. "But something will answer." The party nods—risk accepted, stakes clear.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Basic Spellcasting} \index{magic!spellcasting}

All spellcasting follows the standard action resolution system but with additional considerations for magical effects.

\subsection*{The Casting Process}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Declare Intent: What you want the magic to achieve
\item Choose Approach: Which magical skill and method you'll use
\item Set Position: Controlled, Risky, or Desperate based on circumstances
\item Roll: Attribute + Magical Skill
\item Resolve: Apply outcomes with magical consequences
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Magical Skills}

Common magical skills include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Arcana:} General magical knowledge and theory
\item \textbf{Elemental Magic:} Fire, water, earth, air manipulation
\item \textbf{Spiritual Magic:} Communing with spirits, divine magic
\item \textbf{Mental Magic:} Telepathy, illusion, mind affecting
\item \textbf{Healing Magic:} Restoration, purification, life magic
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Player Tip:} State a clear intent and a vivid method. The more concrete the fiction, the easier it is to set fair DV and meaningful consequences.

\section*{The Casting Loop} \index{magic!casting loop}

For more significant magical effects, use the structured Casting Loop requiring two actions.

\subsection*{Phase 1: Weave}

Shape the magical effect:
\begin{itemize}
\item Player builds dice pool and rolls
\item On success, they stabilize the spell's form
\item Any 1 rolled may cause narrative backlash related to the Element
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Phase 2: Cast}

Channel the effect into the world:
\begin{itemize}
\item A second roll channels the effect
\item Backlash: Any 1 rolled may cause narrative backlash related to the Element
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Designer Note:} The Casting Loop requires the Caster's Gift talent (2 XP) and creates spotlight tension: describe effect now, risk Backlash on each roll.

\section*{Backlash Severity} \index{magic!backlash}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Roll Result} & \textbf{Backlash Trigger} \\
\hline
Partial/Miss & Minor backlash (choose one) \\
Miss & Major backlash (choose two) \\
Hit with two or more 1s & Minor backlash alongside success \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section*{Magical Arts and Traditions} \index{magic!traditions}

Different cultures and traditions approach magic differently.

\subsection*{Elemental Magic}

Manipulation of natural forces:
\begin{description}
\item[Fire Magic:] Heat, light, transformation, destruction
\item[Water Magic:] Flow, healing, divination, adaptation
\item[Earth Magic:] Stability, protection, growth, strength
\item[Air Magic:] Movement, communication, freedom, change
\end{description}

\subsection*{Spiritual Magic}

Interaction with intangible forces:
\begin{description}
\item[Divine Magic:] Power from gods or higher powers
\item[Spirit Magic:] Communing with nature spirits or ancestors
\item[Necromancy:] Interaction with death and the departed
\item[Protection Magic:] Wards, blessings, purification
\end{description}

\subsection*{Mental Magic}

\begin{description}
\item[Illusion:] Creating false perceptions and images
\item[Telepathy:] Mind reading and communication
\item[Enchantment:] Influencing thoughts and emotions

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Vignette, fonttitle=\bfseries]
The candles lean toward the oracle's breath. "Ask," she whispers, "but truth is sharp."
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Ritual Magic} \index{magic!ritual}

Rituals take Significant Time (typically 10-30 minutes) for powerful effects.

\subsection*{Ritual Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item Time: Significant Time (typically 10-30 minutes)
\item Preparation: Specific materials, locations, or conditions
\item Focus: Undisturbed concentration and coordination
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Ritual Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Preparation: Gather components, prepare space, focus intent
\item Invocation: Perform the Rite as a ritual
\item Completion: Effect manifests, always marks +1 Obligation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Ritual Benefits and Risks}

\begin{description}
\item[Benefits:] Safe casting, no Push It option
\item[Risks:] Time investment, Obligation cost, environmental requirements
\end{description}

\section*{Rites and Pact Magic} \index{magic!rites}

Rites are precise magical effects gained through pacts with powerful entities. There are two main paths to accessing Rites:

\subsection*{The Runekeeper (Rites Path)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Requires Patron + Thiasos (Familiar) + Codex (4 XP)
\item Accesses that Patron's full Rite list
\item Structured, powerful, but accrues Obligation
\item Can Push Rites once per scene for +1 Obligation
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Invoker (Symbol Path)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Requires one or more Patron's Symbols (4 XP each)
\item Accesses ritual invocation of Patron's Rites
\item Safe but slow—requires Significant Time
\item Can Crack the Seal for instant cast at steep Obligation cost (+2/+3)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Using Rites}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Invocation: Invoke a Rite requires 1 Action
\item Obligation: Each Rite used marks Obligation on its clock
\item Effect: The Rite's specific effect manifests
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Rite Invocation via Symbol}

\begin{itemize}
\item Time. Invoking a Rite via Symbol takes DV + 1 rounds.
\item Obligation. On completion, mark +1 Obligation (in addition to any listed Rite costs, if applicable).
\item No Push. Invoker Rites cannot use Push It benefits.
\item Symbol Display. The Symbol must remain visible throughout the invocation.
\item Materials. Symbols replace any Thaisos and Codex requirements.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Obligation Capacity} \index{magic!obligation}

A character's Obligation Capacity equals Spirit + Presence. Track total Obligation segments across all Patrons (or Symbols, for Invokers).

\begin{itemize}
\item Exceeding Capacity: For each segment above Capacity, mark 1 Fatigue. The character cannot Invoke Rites or perform rituals until Obligation is reduced below Capacity.
\item Resolution: Reduce Obligation through Downtime service, Patron tasks, ritual cleansing, or story resolution.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} Spirit 2 + Presence 3 = Capacity 5. 6 segments → Fatigue 1. 7 segments → Fatigue 2. 10 segments → Harm 1. 11 segments → Harm 2.

\subsection*{Obligation Management}

Your debt to Patrons must be managed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Service: Perform tasks fitting your Patron's nature
\item Offerings: Provide sacrifices or tributes
\item Propagation: Spread your Patron's influence or beliefs
\item Downtime: Clear through fitting service during downtime
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Obligation Levels}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Segments} & \textbf{Consequences} \\
\hline
1–2 & Minor attention, subtle signs \\
3–5 & Noticeable influence, regular demands \\
6–8 & Significant control, major tasks required \\
9+ & Dominant influence, potentially dangerous \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Vignette, fonttitle=\bfseries]
At the crossroads, Ash lays iron nails and salt. The wind shifts. Somewhere, something smiles.

\item Responsibility: Accepting consequences of magical actions
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Magic Quick Reference, fonttitle=\bfseries]
\textbf{Casting (Freeform):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires Talent: Caster's Gift (2 XP)
\item Weave \& Cast: Two action effect using the Eight Elements
\item Backlash: Any 1 rolled may cause narrative backlash
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Backlash Severity:}
\begin{itemize}
\item On Partial/Miss: Pick 1-2 consequences flavored by Element
\item Color consequences by Element (fire burns, fate twists, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rites System:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Invoke: 1 action effect
\item Obligation: Mark segments on clock
\item Push It: +1 Obligation for +1 step effect
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Invoker Path:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Symbols (4 XP each) grant ritual access
\item Rituals: Significant Time, always +1 Obligation
\item Crack the Seal: Instant cast (+2/+3 Obligation)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Safety:} Every roll changes the story. Success without risk is rare.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Practical Magic Examples} \index{magic!examples}

\subsection*{Fire Cast, Partial}

You Weave flame to blind a squad (DV 3). Partial with two 1s. GM spends SB to Position -1 (flare blinds you too) and colors backlash as singed lashes; patrol is alerted (Exposure).

\subsection*{Runekeeper Push and Debt}

You Invoke Circle of Denial [WARD] and Push It to harden the ring. Mark +1 Obligation for the Rite plus +1 for the push. When a demon tests the ring, use [WARD] vs Cap; on its Hit, add +DV to its Leash.

\subsection*{Crack the Seal Under Fire}

You present Ikasha's Symbol and Crack the Seal to lay an instant shadow lane. Symbol → Compromised; mark +2 Obligation. GM immediately spends 1 SB to dim all lights (panic), then the lane forms. During downtime, you restore the Symbol (Arcana DV 3): a shaky hit leaves it Neglected until you perform the full rite of cleaning.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Closing Thought, fonttitle=\bfseries]
Magic is a powerful tool but never a safe one. Every casting carries risks, and great power always demands great responsibility. Make bold choices—then let the consequences write the next chapter.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Narrative-Heavy Magic Options} \index{Narrative-Heavy Gameplay!Magic}

For groups that prefer strong narrative focus in magic use, consider these optional approaches:

\textbf{Intent-Driven Magic:} For minor magical effects that don't significantly alter the story, players can simply declare what they want to accomplish and describe how they do it, without rolling dice. The GM determines if the effect is reasonable and what complications might arise.

\textbf{Collaborative Backlash:} Instead of the GM unilaterally determining backlash, players can suggest thematic consequences that fit the fiction, with GM approval. This makes magic feel more collaborative and story-driven.

\textbf{Ritual as Story Beats:} Major magical workings can be treated as scene-defining moments where the group collaboratively describes what happens, with mechanical effects determined by the narrative impact rather than detailed rolls.

\textbf{Patron Relationships:} Focus on the roleplaying aspects of Patron relationships, treating Obligation as a measure of story tension and character development rather than just a mechanical track to be managed.

\textbf{Magic as Character Development:} Use magical experiences as opportunities for character growth and backstory development, allowing players to narrate how their characters learned new abilities through significant story moments.

\chapter{Attributes and Skills} \label{ch:attributes}

A diplomat (Presence 3, Sway 2) negotiates:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dice pool: 3 + 2 = 5d10
\item Position: Risky (opponent is skeptical)
\item Stakes: Success gets cooperation, failure creates suspicion
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Exploration Example}

A scout (Wits 3, Perception 2) searches for tracks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dice pool: 3 + 2 = 5d10
\item DV 2 for fresh tracks, DV 3 for old tracks
\item Success finds trail, partial finds clues, miss misses important signs
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Final Note, fonttitle=\bfseries]
Your Attributes and Skills define not just what you can do, but how you approach challenges. Choose combinations that reflect your character's personality and style, and let the fiction lead your mechanical choices.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Narrative-Heavy Skill Options} \index{Narrative-Heavy Gameplay!Skills}

For groups that prefer strong narrative focus in skill use, consider these optional approaches:

\textbf{Intent-Driven Skills:} For routine tasks that don't significantly impact the story, players can simply declare what they want to accomplish without rolling dice. The GM determines if the action succeeds based on the character's capabilities and the fiction.

\textbf{Descriptive Assistance Bonuses:} Players can provide vivid, helpful descriptions of how they're using their skills to assist allies, granting a +1 die bonus to the primary actor's roll without spending Boons.

\textbf{Skill as Character Development:} Use skill challenges as opportunities for character growth and backstory development, allowing players to narrate how their characters learned new techniques through significant story moments.

\textbf{Collaborative Difficulty Setting:} Instead of the GM unilaterally setting DVs, players can suggest reasonable difficulty levels based on their understanding of the task, with GM approval.

\textbf{Narrative Skill Synergies:} Focus on how skills work together in the story rather than mechanical bonuses. A well-described combination of skills might grant advantage on Position or Effect without requiring specific synergy rules.

\chapter{Experience Paths and Character Building} \label{ch:paths}

How you spend your Experience Points (XP) defines not only your character's capabilities—but also their role in the world. This chapter explores different advancement philosophies and provides practical, legal starting builds that fit the campaign's creation rules.

\section*{Three Advancement Paths} \index{Character Development Paths}

There are three broad approaches to character development, each representing a different philosophy of growth:

\begin{description}
\item[Personal Path] Invest in personal mastery and self-improvement
\item[Balanced Path] Mix personal growth with resources and influence
\item[Influencer Path] Focus on networks, assets, and strategic power
\end{description}

\section*{Path 1: Personal Development} \index{Character Development Paths!Personal}

The Personal Path focuses on individual capability through attributes and skills.

\subsection*{Typical Investment}

\begin{itemize}
\item 70–90\% Personal improvement
\item 0–10\% Resources and assets
\item 0–20\% Special abilities
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Strengths}

\begin{itemize}
\item Reliable in direct challenges and combat
\item Minimal upkeep or management required
\item Resilient to loss of external resources
\item Consistent performance in spotlight moments
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Weaknesses}

\begin{itemize}
\item Limited influence in social or strategic scenes
\item May struggle with problems requiring networks

\begin{itemize}
\item Costs (Attributes cost new rating ×3 each step): Body 1→2 (6), 2→3 (9) = 15; Wits 1→2 (6) = 6; Spirit/Presence remain 1 = 0. Subtotal: 21 XP
\end{itemize}
\item Skills: Melee 2, Athletics 1
\begin{itemize}
\item Costs (Skills cost new level ×2 each step): Melee 0→1 (2), 1→2 (4) = 6; Athletics 0→1 = 2. Subtotal: 8 XP
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Practical Building Examples (Narrative Roles, Legal Starts)} \index{Character Creation!Examples}

\subsection*{Example 1: The Guardian}

Path: Personal \hfill Total: 30 XP

\begin{itemize}
\item Attributes: Body 3 (15), Wits 2 (6) = 21 XP
\item Skills: Melee 2 (6), Athletics 1 (2) = 8 XP
\item Bank: 1 XP
\item Role at table: Frontline protection, reliable duel pressure. With +4 XP, add Combat Reflexes (2 XP talent) and Shield Mastery (4 XP talent) using banked 1 + 4 = 5 XP, with 1 XP remaining.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Example 2: The Explorer}

Path: Balanced \hfill Total: 30 XP

\begin{itemize}
\item Attributes: Wits 2 (6), Body 2 (6) = 12 XP
\item Skills: Survival 2 (6), Perception 1 (2), Stealth 1 (2) = 10 XP
\item Resources: Minor mapping kit \& route notes = 4 XP
\item Ability: Trail Sense = 4 XP
\item Totals: 30 XP. With +4 XP, raise Perception 1→2 (+4) or add a trained beast (Minor Resource, 4).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Example 3: The Schemer}

Path: Influencer \hfill Total: 30 XP

\begin{itemize}
\item Attributes: Presence 2 (6), Wits 2 (6) = 12 XP
\item Skills: Sway 2 (6), Deception 1 (2), Lore 1 (2) = 10 XP
\item Resources: Standard safehouse \& message drops = 8 XP
\item Totals: 30 XP. With +4 XP, take Network Builder (4 XP talent) or add Minor informant ring (4 XP).
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Reminder, fonttitle=\bfseries]
All builds above assume baseline Attributes at 1 and Skills at 0 before spending. Attribute and Skill advances are cumulative by step (see costs in §6.5).

Remember: Your chosen path should reflect both your character concept and your preferred play style. There's no single "correct" path—only what works for you and your group.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Narrative-Heavy Character Building Options} \index{Narrative-Heavy Gameplay!Character Building}

For groups that prefer strong narrative focus in character building, consider these optional approaches:

\textbf{Story-Driven Milestones:} Instead of tracking XP numerically, the GM can award advancement when characters reach significant story milestones. "You've trained with the master for months—you've improved your skill."

\textbf{Experience Through Reflection:} Players can spend downtime scenes reflecting on past experiences to earn XP. A meaningful flashback or character moment can justify growth without tracking specific points.

\textbf{Collaborative Advancement:} The group can discuss and agree on advancement choices, ensuring everyone's growth supports the overall story direction.

\textbf{Narrative Justification Focus:} When spending XP, players should explain how their character gained this capability through in-game experiences, creating richer backstory and continuity.

\textbf{Path as Theme:} Focus on the narrative themes of your chosen path rather than strict XP allocations. A Personal Path character might emphasize their journey of self-mastery, while an Influencer Path character focuses on their growing web of relationships and influence.

\chapter{Talents and Special Abilities} \label{ch:talents}

Talents are the building blocks of character specialization. They represent learned techniques, supernatural gifts, or cultural inheritances. Each Talent costs XP, and their costs are tied to impact.

\section*{Understanding Talents} \index{Talents}

Talents are purchased with Experience Points (XP) and provide special capabilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item They go beyond simple skill bonuses
\item They often have specific activation conditions
\item They may provide narrative permissions (you can try things others cannot)
\item They can define your character's unique identity
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Talent Costs}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Cost} & \textbf{Examples} \\
\hline
Minor Edge & 2 XP & Caster's Gift, +1 situational bonus \\
Major Edge & 4 XP & Patron's Symbol, strong summon upgrade \\
Prestige & 6+ XP & Campaign-defining effects \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Activation Types}

\begin{description}
\item[Passive:] Always on; no action
\item[Active:] Requires an action or scene focus
\item[Reactive:] Triggers on a condition
\end{description}

\subsection*{Limits and Economy}

Unless a talent says otherwise:
\begin{itemize}
\item Per Scene uses refresh at scene end
\item Per Session uses refresh after downtime
\item Some talents allow you to spend Boons to push effects

\section*{Selecting Talents} \index{Talents!selection}

\subsection*{Consider Your Magical Path}

Choose talents that reinforce your character's magical approach:
\begin{itemize}
\item Caster: Freeform spellcasting talents, elemental control
\item Runekeeper: Rites access, Obligation management, Patron specialization
\item Invoker: Ritual efficiency, Symbol maintenance, invocation speed
\item Specialist: Unique talents matching your specific focus
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Balance Access and Power}

Consider both access requirements and power talents:
\begin{itemize}
\item Access: Essential prerequisites (Caster's Gift, Familiar)
\item Power: Combat enhancements, magical amplifications
\item Utility: Support abilities, resource management
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Think About Investment}

Consider how much XP each talent represents:
\begin{itemize}
\item Minor (2 XP): Essential access, small narrative tricks
\item Major (4 XP): Strong upgrades, permanent effects in niche
\item Prestige (6+ XP): Campaign-defining, fundamental limits broken
\end{itemize}

\section*{Talent Building Strategies} \index{Talents!building strategies}

\subsection*{The Specialist}

Focus on talents supporting one primary magical path:
\begin{itemize}
\item Choose talents that synergize with each other
\item Develop a clear specialization identity
\item Become the go-to character for specific magical challenges
\item Risk: May be less effective outside specialty
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Generalist}

Spread talents across multiple magical approaches:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cover different types of magical challenges
\item Provide support to other party members
\item Adapt to diverse situations
\item Risk: Less peak capability in any area, increased bookkeeping
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Foundation Builder}

Focus on essential access talents first:
\begin{itemize}
\item Prioritize access requirements (Caster's Gift, Familiar)
\item Build toward major capabilities
\item Establish core identity before specialization
\item Risk: May lack immediate power payoff
\end{itemize}

\item Mechanical clarity: Define activation, effects, and limits
\end{itemize}

\section*{Talents and Group Dynamics} \index{Talents!group dynamics}

Consider how your talents complement the party:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fill gaps: Cover party weaknesses in magical capabilities
\item Synergize: Coordinate with other players' magical approaches
\item Avoid overlap: Don't duplicate another character's access path
\item Support role: Talents that help the whole group manage magical risks
\end{itemize}

\section*{Talent Respecification} \index{Talents!respecification}

If your character concept changes, you may respec talents:
\begin{itemize}
\item GM approval required: Discuss proposed changes
\item Downtime cost: Represent retraining (typically 1 downtime period)
\item Story justification: Explain the change in-narrative
\item Limited frequency: Typically once per major story arc
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Talent Selection Guide, fonttitle=\bfseries]
\textbf{Early Game (0–40 XP):}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1–2 access talents (2 XP each)
\item 2–4 basic talents (2 XP each)
\item Focus on essential capabilities
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mid Game (41–90 XP):}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1–2 major talents (4 XP each)
\item 1–2 advanced talents (4–6 XP each)
\item Plan for prestige prerequisites
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Late Game (91+ XP):}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1–2 prestige talents (6+ XP each)
\item Campaign-defining capabilities
\item Party-supporting abilities
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Remember:} Talents should reflect your character's story and magical growth.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Final Note, fonttitle=\bfseries]
The best talents are those that fit your magical concept and table playstyle. Choose abilities you'll enjoy using, that create interesting consequences, and that contribute to your character's unfolding story through the lens of risk and consequence that defines Fate's Edge magic.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Narrative-Heavy Talent Options} \index{Narrative-Heavy Gameplay!Talents}

For groups that prefer strong narrative focus in talent use, consider these optional approaches:

\textbf{Story-Driven Talents:} Instead of mechanical bonuses, some talents can provide narrative permissions or story effects. "Courtly Grace" might allow you to navigate noble society without rolls, while "Wild Empathy" lets you communicate with animals through roleplay rather than dice.

\textbf{Collaborative Talent Activation:} Players can describe how their talents work in the fiction, with GM approval, rather than relying solely on mechanical triggers. A "Master Strategist" might narrate how they reposition allies through clever tactics rather than just declaring the mechanical effect.

\textbf{Talent as Character Development:} Use talent acquisition as opportunities for character growth and backstory development, allowing players to narrate how their characters learned new abilities through significant story moments.

\textbf{Flexible Talent Interpretation:} Focus on the thematic effects of talents rather than strict mechanical applications. A "Weapon Mastery" talent might manifest differently depending on the weapon and situation, with the GM and player collaborating on the specific benefits.

\chapter{Assets and Followers} \label{ch:assets}

Your character's influence extends beyond personal capabilities through Assets and Followers. These represent worldly possessions, connections, and allies that can solve problems, provide assistance, and shape the narrative.

\section*{Understanding Assets and Followers} \index{Assets}\index{Followers}

\subsection*{Key Differences}

\begin{description}
\item[Assets:] Off-screen resources that solve problems between scenes.
\item[Followers:] On-screen allies who assist during gameplay.
\item[Assets change:] The fictional situation before you arrive.
\item[Followers act:] Alongside you in the moment.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Management Requirements}

Both require maintenance and carry risks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Regular upkeep costs (XP or downtime).
\item Vulnerability to complications and attacks.
\item Narrative consequences for misuse or neglect.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Assets System} \index{Assets!system}

Assets are possessions, properties, or resources you control.

\subsection*{Asset Types and Costs}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Type} & \textbf{XP Cost} & \textbf{Establishment Time} \\
\hline
Minor & 4 XP & 1 day \\
Standard & 8 XP & 1 week \\
Major & 12 XP & 1 month \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Asset Examples}

\begin{description}
\item[Minor Assets] Small shop, safehouse, minor title, basic workshop.
\item[Standard Assets] Noble title, guild membership, trading post, spy network.
\item[Major Assets] Fortress, city license, major enterprise, regional influence.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Using Assets}

Assets provide benefits in different ways:

\subsubsection*{Free Off-Screen Use}

Each asset has a specific off-screen effect you can use once per session:
\begin{itemize}
\item Safehouse: Provide secure lodging for the party.
\item Spy Network: Gather basic intelligence about a location.
\item Workshop: Repair or create simple items between adventures.
\item Trading Post: Acquire common goods at better prices.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Boon Activation}

Spend 1 Boon to use an asset dramatically during a scene:
\begin{itemize}
\item Safehouse: Suddenly reveal a hidden escape route.
\item Spy Network: Produce crucial information at a critical moment.
\item Workshop: Create an improvised solution to an immediate problem.
\item Trading Post: Call in a favor from a business contact.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{XP Activation}

Spend 2 XP to use an asset's off-screen effect outside your normal allowance:
\begin{itemize}
\item Emergency use when you've already used your free activation.
\item Additional uses during downtime periods.
\item Special circumstances requiring extra asset support.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Asset Conditions} \index{Assets!conditions}

Assets have condition states affecting their usefulness:

\subsection*{Condition Levels}

\begin{description}
\item[Maintained] Fully functional, no penalties.
\item[Neglected] −1 die when used; requires attention.
\item[Compromised] Unavailable until repaired or recovered.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Maintenance Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item Regular Upkeep: Two options per SRD §21.2:
\begin{itemize}
\item Efficient (Higher XP, Less Time): Pay Upkeep XP = max(1, XP Acquisition)/3, minimal effort
\item Intensive (Lower XP, More Time): Pay 1 XP, dedicated downtime action
\end{itemize}
\item Neglect: Assets deteriorate if not maintained.
\item Recovery: Compromised assets require significant effort to restore.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Followers System} \index{Followers!system}

Followers are characters who assist you directly.

\subsection*{Follower Capability Ratings}

Followers are rated by Capability (Cap) from 1 to 5:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Cap} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
1 & Novice helper, basic assistance \\
2 & Competent assistant, reliable support \\
3 & Skilled specialist, valuable aid \\
4 & Expert ally, significant capability \\
5 & Master companion, exceptional ability \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Follower Costs}

\begin{itemize}
\item XP Cost: Capability squared (Cap$^2$).
\item Example: Cap 3 follower costs 3$^2$ = 9 XP.
\item Recruitment: 1–3 days downtime to find and brief.
\item Limits: The GM may set maximum followers based on story.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Follower Types}

\begin{description}
\item[Combat Allies] Warriors, guards, mercenaries.
\item[Technical Experts] Craftspeople, engineers, specialists.
\item[Social Contacts] Informants, diplomats, agents.
\item[Specialists] Unique capabilities like magic or stealth.
\end{description}

\section*{Using Followers} \index{Followers!usage}

\subsection*{Assistance in Scenes}

Followers can help with your actions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Assist Dice: Add dice equal to min(Cap, relevant skill).
\item Maximum Bonus: +3 dice total from all sources.
\item Cost: Spend 1 Boon or 1 Stress to add +1 die (max +3 from assists).
\item One Helper: Only one follower can assist per action.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Independent Actions}

Once per scene (party-wide), a follower can take a small action:
\begin{description}
\item[Scout \& Signal] Change an ally's next action to Controlled position.
\item[Distract \& Draw] Reduce a threat clock by 1 segment.
\item[Fetch \& Carry] Move an object through danger safely.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Cost of Independent Actions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Mark +1 Exposure (attention or stress), or
\item Take Harm 1 (injury or trauma).
\item Cannot be used if the follower is already Compromised.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Follower Conditions} \index{Followers!conditions}

Followers track two condition types:

\subsection*{Exposure}

Represents attention, stress, or narrative pressure:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gains: From independent actions, dangerous situations, complications.
\item Effects: Increased risk, reduced effectiveness, attention from enemies.
\item Recovery: Downtime activities, careful management.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Harm}

Represents injury, trauma, or damage:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gains: From combat, accidents, enemy attacks.
\item Effects: Penalties to assistance, possible incapacity.
\item Recovery: Medical care, rest, magical healing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Condition States}

\begin{description}
\item[Maintained] Ready and reliable, full capability.
\item[Neglected] Needs attention, −1 die to assistance.
\item[Compromised] Unavailable: captured, defected, lost, or incapacitated.
\end{description}

\section*{Follower Risks} \index{Followers!risks}

Using followers carries significant risks:

\subsection*{Complication Targeting}

When the GM spends 2+ Story Beats on an action where you have assistance:
\begin{itemize}
\item The follower may face consequences instead of you.
\item Could be injury, capture, betrayal, or other complications.
\item Fictionally appropriate to the situation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Off-Screen Capability}

Once per downtime, a Cap 5 follower can solve a significant problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item But generates 1 Story Beat for the party.
\item The GM describes how this creates story consequences.
\item Useful for emergencies but costly.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Upkeep and Maintenance} \index{Assets!upkeep}\index{Followers!upkeep}

Both assets and followers require regular maintenance.

\subsection*{Asset Upkeep}

Two options per SRD §21.2:
\begin{itemize}
\item Option 1 - Efficient (Higher XP, Less Time):
\begin{itemize}
\item Cost: Pay Upkeep XP = max(1, AcquisitionXP )/3
\item Time: Minimal effort
\end{itemize}
\item Option 2 - Intensive (Lower XP, More Time):
\begin{itemize}
\item Cost: Pay 1 XP
\item Time: Dedicated downtime action with significant personal involvement
\end{itemize}
\item Failure to Pay: Asset becomes Neglected (or Compromised if already Neglected)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Follower Upkeep}

Two options per SRD §21.2:
\begin{itemize}
\item Option 1 - Efficient:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cost: Pay Upkeep XP = max(1, Cap$^2$)/3
\item Time: Minimal effort
\end{itemize}
\item Option 2 - Intensive:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cost: Pay 1 XP
\item Time: Dedicated downtime action with significant personal involvement
\end{itemize}
\item Failure to Pay: Follower becomes Wary (or Seized if already Wary)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Strategic Considerations} \index{Assets!strategy}\index{Followers!strategy}

\subsection*{When to Invest in Assets}

\begin{itemize}
\item You need reliable off-screen capabilities.
\item Your character concept involves wealth or influence.
\item The party lacks certain logistical support.
\item You want to build long-term influence.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{When to Invest in Followers}

\begin{itemize}
\item You need on-screen assistance.
\item Your character works better with support.
\item The party needs specific capabilities you lack.
\item You want character-driven story opportunities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Balance Recommendations}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Path} & \textbf{Investment} \\
\hline
Personal Path & 0–10\% assets/followers \\
Balanced Path & 15–25\% assets/followers \\
Influencer Path & 35–55\% assets/followers \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section*{Loyalty and Relationships} \index{Followers!loyalty}

\subsection*{Loyalty Levels}

Optional system for tracking follower loyalty:
\begin{description}
\item[Wary] Cautious, may leave if pressured; +1 XP upkeep cost.
\item[Steady] Reliable, standard performance; normal upkeep.
\item[Devoted] Loyal, may sacrifice; can convert one major complication to a minor setback per arc.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Building Loyalty}

\begin{itemize}

\item Unreasonable demands or risks.
\item Broken promises or betrayal.
\item Consistent neglect.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Advanced Follower Management} \index{Followers!advanced}

\subsection*{Follower Groups}

For multiple similar followers, you can manage them as a group:
\begin{itemize}
\item Single Rating: Treat as one entity with combined capability.
\item Condition Tracking: Group shares exposure and harm.
\item Maintenance: Single upkeep cost for the group.
\item Risks: Problems affect the entire group.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Follower Advancement}

Followers can improve over time:
\begin{itemize}
\item Experience: Gain capability through successful assistance.
\item Training: Spend XP to improve follower capabilities.
\item Equipment: Better gear can enhance effectiveness.
\item Limits: Followers typically cap at lower levels than PCs.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Risk Management} \index{Assets!risk management}\index{Followers!risk management}

\subsection*{Asset Risks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Financial: Assets can be costly to maintain.
\item Security: Assets can be attacked or stolen.
\item Attention: Valuable assets draw unwanted notice.
\item Dependency: Over-reliance can be problematic.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Follower Risks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Safety: Followers can be harmed or captured.
\item Loyalty: Followers may betray or leave.
\item Attention: Followers can draw enemy interest.
\item Morale: Followers have needs and limits.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Mitigation Strategies}

\begin{itemize}
\item Diversification: Don't put all resources in one place.
\item Security: Protect valuable assets and followers.
\item Relationships: Maintain good terms with your people.
\item Contingencies: Have backup plans for losses.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Assets and Followers Quick Reference, fonttitle=\bfseries]
\textbf{Assets:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Minor: 4 XP | Standard: 8 XP | Major: 12 XP
\item Free off-screen use: once per session
\item Boon activation: spend 1 Boon for scene impact
\item Conditions: Maintained → Neglected → Compromised
\end{itemize}

\item Cost: Cap$^2$ XP
\item Assistance: + min(Cap, skill) dice (max +3 from all sources)
\item Independent action: once per scene (party-wide)
\item Conditions: Exposure and Harm tracks
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Upkeep Options:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Efficient: max(1, Cost)/3 XP, minimal time
\item Intensive: 1 XP, dedicated downtime action
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Practical Examples} \index{Assets!examples}\index{Followers!examples}

\subsection*{Asset Example: The Safehouse}

\begin{itemize}
\item Type: Minor Asset (4 XP)
\item Free Use: Secure lodging, basic supplies between adventures.
\item Boon Activation: Reveal a hidden escape route during pursuit.
\item Upkeep: Option 1: 2 XP (4/3 rounded up) or Option 2: 1 XP + downtime action.
\item Risks: Discovery by enemies, maintenance costs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Follower Example: The Scout}

\begin{itemize}
\item Capability: 3 (9 XP cost)
\item Assistance: +3 dice on tracking and survival rolls.
\item Independent Action: Scout ahead to improve party position.
\item Upkeep: Option 1: 3 XP (9/3) or Option 2: 1 XP + downtime action.
\item Risks: Injury in dangerous scouting; disloyalty if mistreated.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Combination Example: The Merchant}

\begin{itemize}
\item Assets: Trading post (8 XP), caravan (4 XP) — 12 XP total
\item Followers: Cap 2 guards (4 XP each = 8 XP), Cap 3 factor (9 XP) — 17 XP total
\item Total Investment: 29 XP in assets and followers
\item Upkeep (Efficient Option): Assets 4 XP + Followers 6 XP = 10 XP per downtime period
\item Benefits: Trade income, transport, protection, business contacts
\item Risks: Competition, bandit attacks, employee issues, regulatory attention
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Remember, fonttitle=\bfseries]
Assets and followers can greatly expand your capabilities, but they require careful management and carry significant risks. Invest wisely based on your character concept and the needs of your group. The SRD provides flexible upkeep options to suit different play styles and campaign pacing.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Narrative-Heavy Asset and Follower Options} \index{Narrative-Heavy Gameplay!Assets and Followers}

For groups that prefer strong narrative focus in asset and follower management, consider these optional approaches:

\textbf{Story-Driven Upkeep:} Instead of tracking XP costs for upkeep, the GM can introduce narrative complications that require attention. A neglected asset might attract unwanted attention, while a neglected follower might request a favor or special treatment.

\textbf{Collaborative Management:} Players can describe how they maintain their assets and followers through roleplay rather than mechanical upkeep costs. A well-described scene of tending to a workshop or bonding with followers can fulfill maintenance requirements.

\textbf{Asset and Follower as Character Development:} Use asset and follower management as opportunities for character growth and backstory development, allowing players to narrate how their relationships and holdings evolve through significant story moments.

\textbf{Flexible Condition Tracking:} Focus on the narrative implications of asset and follower conditions rather than strict mechanical penalties. A "Neglected" asset might still function but with interesting complications, while a "Compromised" asset might require creative solutions rather than just XP investment.

\chapter{World Interaction} \label{ch:world}

In Fate's Edge, the world is not a backdrop—it's a partner in the conversation. Dikes groan under black rain in Viterra, clan horns answer across Acasia's ridgelines, Ecktoria's marble halls echo with careful words, and Kahfagia's pilots read storms by taste. Wherever you go, place, culture, and pressure push back.

\section*{Game Structure and Time} \index{Game Structure}

Understanding how time works in Fate's Edge helps you navigate both the mechanical and narrative flow of play.

\subsection*{Basic Units}

\begin{description}
\item[Scene] The basic unit of narrative play, covering a specific situation or conflict (Some Time to Significant Time). Resolves a particular question or challenge.
\item[Player Turn (Beat)] An individual player's action within a scene: Declare action → GM sets position → roll → resolve outcome → manage consequences.
\item[Round] Simultaneous or near-simultaneous actions within a scene (primarily for combat), representing a few seconds of real time.
\item[Session] One complete game session (typically 3–6 hours), containing 2–4 major scenes and resolving significant narrative progress.
\item[Downtime] The narrative time between scenes, used for recovery, advancement, and off-screen activities. Measured in days, weeks, or months depending on fiction.
\item[Campaign] Entire story arc (6–20+ sessions) with major character development and lasting consequences.
\end{description}

\section*{Movement and Positioning} \index{Movement}

Space is tracked with range bands and Position.

\subsection*{Range Bands}

\begin{description}
\item[Close] Touching distance: grapples, knife-work, hand on a relic.
\item[Near] Same room/yard/deck; a rush away.
\item[Far] Same site but distant; requires route or time to reach.
\item[Absent] Off-screen; requires scene change or significant effort to interact.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Movement Actions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Move: Shift one range band as a beat.
\item Dash: Shift two bands as your full action (terrain may require a roll).
\item Melee Flag: Mark when two parties are in Near range and directly engaged in combat.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Position States}

\begin{description}
\item[Controlled] You have cover, leverage, or ritual footing. Failure still leaves options.
\item[Risky] Standard case: exposed lanes, rivals near, watchful eyes. Failure has teeth, but not ruin.
\item[Desperate] Bad ground, bad odds, bad timing. Failure is severe; success may bring extra XP.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Position Shifting}

\begin{itemize}
\item GM can spend 1 SB to worsen Position by one step.
\item Player can spend 1 Boon to improve Position by one step (once per action).
\item Narrative triggers (flanking, reinforcements, etc.) can shift Position without cost.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Travel Framework} \index{Travel}

Travel abstracts distance into legs with tension and color rather than miles and meal counts. Each leg has a Travel Clock and draws on a regional deck to seed fiction.

\subsection*{Travel Process}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Set the Leg: Name origin and destination; start a Travel Clock (4-10 segments based on difficulty).
\item Draw Prompts: Draw up to one card from each suit to establish terrain, people, pressures, and leverage.
\item Assign Roles: Players take on travel roles (Guide, Scout, Quartermaster, Watch) to contribute actions.
\item Play the Leg: Players take actions to advance the clock or mitigate complications. GM spends SB from rolls showing 1s to introduce hazards.
\item Resolve: When the clock fills, you arrive—changed by the journey.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Using Assets and Followers During Travel}

\begin{itemize}
\item Assets: Spend 1 Boon to activate an asset for dramatic effect during travel (reveal hidden path, call for emergency aid, etc.).
\item Followers: Assign followers to travel roles for bonuses. A Cap 3 Scout follower adds +3 to navigation rolls, for example.
\item Independent Actions: Once per travel leg, a follower can take an independent action (scout ahead, secure supplies, etc.) at the cost of Exposure or Harm.
\item Off-Screen Solutions: High-Cap followers (4-5) can solve significant travel problems once per downtime, but generate 1 SB for the party.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Regional Travel Decks}

Each major region has a themed prompt list or card table:
\begin{description}
\item[Viterra] Fen causeways, dike-brotherhoods, crown law.
\item[Acasia] Border-lace titles, ruined towers, clan tempers.
\item[Ecktoria] Imperial roads, precinct gates, temple schedules.
\item[Ubral] Stone passes, toll-cloisters, ghosted fields.
\item[Kahfagia] Current maps, pilot-mirrors, storm lanes.
\item[Aelinnel] Mist paths, bell-mounds, spirit ways.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Travel Complications}

\begin{itemize}
\item Hazards: Weather, terrain challenges, wildlife encounters.
\item Social: Border checks, local politics, cultural misunderstandings.
\item Supplies: Food shortages, equipment failure, resource management.
\item Pursuit: Being followed, hunted, or racing against time.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Narrative Time} \index{Time}

Time is measured by importance rather than duration.

\begin{description}
\item[A Moment] A glance, a strike, a whisper over a law-stone.
\item[Some Time] A skirmish, a negotiation, a careful climb.
\item[Significant Time] Hours of march, rites, audits, stakeouts.
\item[Days] Drills, recoveries, research, roadwork.
\end{description}

\section*{Social Interactions} \index{Social Interactions}

Social scenes use the same engine with cultural color.

\subsection*{Cultural Skill Emphases}

\begin{description}
\item[Viterra] Rapport with parishes; Sway for markets; Command under writ.
\item[Acasia] Rapport for kin-bridges; Command with banner-rights; Deceive risks honor clocks.
\item[Ecktoria] Sway in salons; Deceive at court; Perform in temple fora.
\item[Kahfagia] Rapport aboard; Sway at piers; Command on a storming deck.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Social Stakes \& Clocks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Alliance Clock (Viterra): Parishes and guilds come to your side.
\item Honor Clock (Acasia): Feasts, oaths, wyrd—trust builds (or frays).
\item Bureau Clock (Ecktoria): Stamps, seals, approvals—delay is pressure.
\item Trust Clock (Kahfagia): Pilots and crews extend favors and routes.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Supply and Resources} \index{Resources}

Track scarcity with a Supply Clock shared by the party's expedition.

\subsection*{Segments}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Segments} & \textbf{State \& Effects} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\hline
0 (Full) & Well-provisioned; no penalty. & \\
2 (Low) & Minor frictions; -1 to resource checks. & \\
3 (Dangerous) & Each PC gains Fatigue 1. & \\
4 (Empty) & Severe penalties; desperate measures. & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section*{Engaging the World—Player Actions} \index{Player Actions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Scout \& Signal: A follower can make the next travel action Controlled (mark Exposure or Harm 1 on them).
\item Local Color: Briefly state what locals notice about you; GM offers a small fictional edge or a tempting clock—choose.
\item Mark the Map: On arrival, declare one change to the fiction (new ford, patron's shrine, toll-skip). GM may attach a minor clock as cost.
\item Asset Activation: Spend 1 Boon to activate an asset dramatically during a scene.
\item Follower Assistance: Have a follower assist your actions for bonus dice (max +3 from all sources).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Summary} \index{World Interaction!summary}

The world has opinions. Movement is clocks and color, position rises and sinks with weather and words, and every suit you draw speaks in a regional accent. Ask the land for a favor—then pay it back on the road.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=gray!75!black, title=Remember, fonttitle=\bfseries]
Every interaction with the world is an opportunity. Use your assets, deploy your followers, and engage with the setting actively. The world responds to your choices, and every journey changes both you and the places you pass through.
\end{tcolorbox}
