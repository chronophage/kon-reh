## 1. Welcome to Fate's Edge

A world where every choice carries weight, every spell risks backlash, and every legend is written in the shadow of consequence.

Welcome to Fate's Edge, a tabletop roleplaying game where narrative drives mechanics, and every decision shapes not only your character's path—but the world around them. This is not a game of perfect successes or clean victories. It is a game of risk, drama, and legacy.

### What Is This Game?

Fate's Edge is a narrative-first RPG where:
- Every roll introduces potential for triumph and complication
- Magic is powerful—but dangerous
- Choices ripple outward, shaping character arcs and the setting
- Growth is meaningful, earned through experience spent on skills and assets

### Core Principles

The game is built on four key ideas:
- **Narrative First**: Mechanics serve the story. Rules reward descriptive play and creative problem-solving.
- **Risk Creates Drama**: Every roll carries tension. Even success may come at a cost.
- **Meaningful Growth**: Experience is a currency of choice. Invest in yourself or your influence on the world.
- **Consequences Matter**: No action is free. Every choice changes the fiction.

### Style of Play

Expect cinematic, collaborative storytelling:
- Stories driven by character choices
- A world that reacts to your decisions
- Themes of legacy, sacrifice, and moral choices

Whether you're a lone duelist, a scheming mastermind, or a spirit-touched outlander, your path is yours to forge.

### Getting Started

This is a game of bold choices and lasting consequences. Your story is written in decisions—not dice rolls.
Welcome to the Edge. The world is watching.
What will you risk to reshape the world?

---

## 2. Core Mechanics

In this game, every action matters. The dice don't just tell you if you succeed—they shape the story by introducing tension, risk, and consequence. Fate's Edge is designed to keep the story moving forward, even when things go wrong.

### 2.1 Basic Dice Mechanics

When you attempt a significant action, you roll a pool of ten-sided dice (d10s). The size of your pool is determined by two factors:
**Dice Pool = Attribute + Skill**

- **Attribute (1–5)**: Broad traits like strength, wit, or charm.
- **Skill (0–5)**: Training or expertise in a specific area.

#### Reading the Dice

| Die Result | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 6–10 | +1 Success |
| 1 | +1 Story Beat (SB) |
| 2–5 | No effect |

**Example**: Lyra the rogue has Agility 3 and Stealth 2. Her dice pool is 5 dice. She rolls: 6, 4, 3, 1, 6. That gives her 2 Successes and 1 Story Beat.

### 2.2 The Description Ladder

Players can enhance their actions through detailed descriptions:

- **Basic Action**: Roll the pool as-is. All 1s remain as Story Beats.
- **Detailed Action**: Re-roll one die showing 1.
- **Intricate Action**: Re-roll all dice showing 1, and add one positive narrative flourish to the scene if they succeed.

**Rule**: Re-rolling 1s does not remove the Story Beats already generated by those dice. If any re-rolled dice show 1 again, they generate additional SB as normal.

### 2.3 Difficulty Value (DV)

Before rolling, the Game Master sets a Difficulty Value (DV)—the target number of Successes needed.

| DV | Situation |
|----|-----------|
| 2 | Routine action, no pressure |
| 3 | Pressured, mild opposition |
| 4 | Difficult, active resistance |
| 5+ | Extreme, high stakes |

**Tip**: A DV of 3 is the most common challenge.

### 2.4 Outcome Matrix

Compare your Successes against the DV:

| Outcome | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Clean Success | Goal achieved cleanly |
| Success & Cost | Goal achieved with complication |
| Partial | Progress but with difficult choice |
| Miss | No progress; complication occurs |

### 2.5 Boons

Boons are narrative currency that players can spend to influence the story in their favor. You can hold up to 5 Boons at a time.

#### Earning Boons

- **Partial Success**: Gain 1 Boon
- **Missed Actions**: Gain 2 Boons
- **Bond-Driven Actions**: Gain 1 Boon (once per bond per session)
- **GM Award**: For creative solutions or spotlighting bonds

#### Spending Boons

- Re-roll a single die in a pool
- Activate an on-screen Asset
- Power a Rite or magical ability
- Improve Position by 1 step
- Convert 2 Boons → 1 XP (once per session during downtime, max 2 XP)

#### Carryover Limits

At the end of each scene, reduce held Boons to a maximum of 2. Excess Boons are lost.

### 2.6 Story Beats (SB)

Story Beats are narrative tools the Game Master uses to introduce twists and tension. They keep the story alive with complications and surprises.

#### What SB Can Do

The GM may spend SB to:
- Introduce new threats or complications
- Drain resources (time, gear, position)
- Reveal hidden dangers
- Cause collateral damage

#### SB Spend Examples

- **1 SB**: Minor complication, noise, trace
- **2 SB**: Moderate setback, alarm raised
- **3 SB**: Serious trouble, reinforcements arrive
- **4+ SB**: Major turn, scene shifts dramatically

### 2.7 Harm and Fatigue

#### Fatigue Track

Each character has a Fatigue Track equal to their Body attribute. Mark Fatigue for:
- Physical exertion
- Magical strain
- Travel stress
- Mental pressure

#### Harm Levels

| Harm Level | Effects |
|------------|---------|
| Harm 1 | -1 die on related actions |
| Harm 2 | -1 die on most actions until treated |
| Harm 3 | Incapacitated or dying |

#### Recovery

- **Short Rest**: Remove 2 Fatigue with food/water
- **Full Night**: Remove all Fatigue
- **Minor treatment**: Downgrade Harm with time/rest
- **Proper medical care**: Remove Harm levels

### 2.8 Assistance

Characters can help each other. One helper per action may provide assistance by spending 1 Boon or 1 Stress, adding +1 die to the primary actor's roll. Maximum +3 dice from assists.

---

## 3. Character Advancement

In this game, growth isn't just about numbers—it's about defining who your character becomes. Advancement through Experience Points (XP) lets you shape your capabilities, influence, and legacy in the world.

## 4. Magic and Special Abilities

Magic in this game is powerful but dangerous—a negotiation with reality itself that always carries risks.

### 4.1 The Nature of Magic

Magic is not a safe tool but a dangerous force:
- Powerful: Can reshape battles, stories, or even the world
- Controlled: Every use generates Story Beats (SB) that manifest as backlash
- Thematic: Effects and consequences align with the type of magic used
- Volatile: Never fully predictable or controllable
- Narrative: Casting is always a significant story moment

### 4.2 Basic Spellcasting

All spellcasting follows the standard action resolution system but with additional considerations for magical effects.

#### The Casting Process

1. Declare Intent
2. Choose Approach
3. Set Position
4. Roll: Attribute + Magical Skill
5. Resolve with magical consequences

### 4.3 The Casting Loop

For more significant magical effects, use the structured Casting Loop requiring two actions.

#### Phase 1: Weave
- Player builds dice pool and rolls
- On success, they stabilize the spell's form
- Any 1 rolled may cause narrative backlash

#### Phase 2: Cast
- A second roll channels the effect
- Backlash: Any 1 rolled may cause narrative backlash

### 4.4 Magical Arts and Traditions

#### Elemental Magic
- **Fire Magic**: Heat, light, transformation, destruction
- **Water Magic**: Flow, healing, divination, adaptation
- **Earth Magic**: Stability, protection, growth, strength

- **Spirit Magic**: Communing with nature spirits or ancestors
- **Necromancy**: Interaction with death and the departed
- **Protection Magic**: Wards, blessings, purification

### 4.5 Ritual Magic

#### Ritual Requirements
- Time: Significant Time
- Preparation: Specific materials, locations, or conditions
- Focus: Undisturbed concentration and coordination

#### The Runekeeper (Rites Path)

#### The Invoker (Symbol Path)
- Requires one or more Patron's Symbols (4 XP each)
- Accesses ritual invocation of Patron's Rites
- Safe but slow—requires Significant Time
- Can Crack the Seal for instant cast at steep Obligation cost (+2/+3)

### 4.7 Obligation Capacity

A character's Obligation Capacity equals Spirit + Presence. Track total Obligation segments across all Patrons (or Symbols, for Invokers).

- **Exceeding Capacity**: For each segment above Capacity, mark 1 Fatigue
- **Resolution**: Reduce Obligation through Downtime service, Patron tasks, ritual cleansing, or story resolution
