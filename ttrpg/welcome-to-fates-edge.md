# Welcome to the World of Fate's Edge

**"What are you willing to risk, and what are you willing to pay, to reshape the world around you?"**

In the shattered remnants of a fallen empire, where ancient magic wars with emerging nations and every choice echoes across contested borders, Fate's Edge presents a world where power comes at a price and consequences matter. This isn't your typical fantasy setting—it's a narrative-first RPG where the dice don't just determine success or failure, but actively shape the story itself.

## The Empire's End and What Came After

Once, the Utaran Empire stretched across continents, its laws and coin accepted from the Amaranthine coast to the Valewood's edge. Now, three centuries after its collapse, the world has fractured into a patchwork of successor states, frontier territories, and ancient powers that never bowed to imperial authority. In **Ecktoria**, marble forums still echo with legal proceedings while coin-houses hold more real power than senators. In **Vhasia**, the "Fractured Sun" sees two rival dukes each claiming the throne, their conflict playing out through proxy wars and legal maneuvering.

This isn't a world rebuilding—it's a world *rebuilding itself*. Every region has its own answer to the question of how civilization should work, and those answers often clash violently.

## Magic That Demands Payment

Gone are the days when wizards could casually reshape reality without consequence. In Fate's Edge, magic comes through **Patron** relationships—powerful entities ranging from angels to demons to ancient concepts like the Pale Shepherd (guide of thresholds) or Thrysos (King of Revels). Each Patron offers specific **Rites** or magical abilities, but every use builds **Obligation**—a narrative debt that the Patron will eventually call in.

Cast a spell to save your companions, and you might find yourself compelled to perform a dangerous service for your Patron later. Use too much magic, and you risk **Corruption**—permanent changes that mark you as belonging to your Patron. This creates the central tension of the magic system: power always demands a price, and the price often comes when you least expect it.

## The Frontier Mentality

Between the established powers lie vast stretches of contested territory where law is what you can enforce and justice is what you can negotiate. In **Ubral**, clan honor and guest-right still matter more than imperial edicts. In the **Wilds**, survival depends on reading the land and maintaining relationships with local spirits. In **Zakov**, the pirate-city where tides trade secrets and knives settle debts, power flows like the currents.

This frontier dynamic means that individual characters can actually matter. A clever negotiator might prevent a war between Vhasia's dukes. A skilled warrior could unite the Ykrul steppe clans. A clever magic user might broker new relationships between ancient Patrons and mortal communities.

## The Weight of Choice

Fate's Edge is built around the principle that **every choice matters**. The core mechanic doesn't just determine if you succeed or fail—it generates **Story Beats** (complications) that the GM must use to make the story more interesting. Miss a lockpicking roll, and you might trigger an alarm, but you also gain **Boons** (story currency) that you can spend later. Even success comes with potential complications as the world reacts to your actions.

This creates a setting where heroes aren't perfect—they're people trying to make a difference in a complicated world that fights back. Your character's **Complications** and **Bonds** aren't just character flaws; they're story hooks that ensure you remain central to the narrative.

## A World of Living Systems

What makes Fate's Edge particularly compelling is how its regions feel alive and reactive. The **Mistlands** have bell-lines that remember every oath sworn. **Valewood** contains ruins that actively reshape themselves based on who enters. **Silkstrand's** dyewater changes color to reflect political tensions. **The Ways Between** respond to the emotional weight of travelers.

These aren't static backdrops—they're active participants in the story. Cross the wrong threshold in the Valewood, and the forest itself might decide you're interesting enough to follow home. Break a geas in Theona, and the Green Host (supernatural forces) will come looking for you.

## The Power of Small Actions

Perhaps most importantly, Fate's Edge recognizes that world-changing events often start with small actions. Help a merchant in **Kahfagia** navigate lantern-law bureaucracy, and you might gain the connections needed to influence regional trade policy. Resolve a feud in **Acasia**, and you could prevent a larger conflict. Save a single family from raiders in the **Wilds**, and you might earn the loyalty that eventually helps you unite the frontier.

This is a setting where **character growth** mirrors **world change**. As your characters gain experience and reputation, they naturally become players in larger conflicts. The system is designed so that personal stories and epic narratives grow together organically.

## Your Story, Your Way

Fate's Edge provides the tools and framework for collaborative storytelling, but the specific story is yours to create. Whether you want to explore the political intrigue of imperial successor states, the survival challenges of frontier life, the complex relationships with supernatural Patrons, or the slow rebuilding of civilization from its ruins, the setting supports your vision.

The dice mechanics ensure that whatever story you're telling, it will be full of twists, turns, and meaningful consequences. The regional generators provide endless inspiration for adventures. The magic system guarantees that power comes with personality and price.

Welcome to Fate's Edge—where your choices don't just shape your character, they shape the world itself.

### Short Copy

Here are three tight elevator-pitch options—different tones, same core message. Pick the one that hits hardest, and I can refine it further.

⸻

1. Core Fantasy Pitch (clean, professional)

Fate’s Edge is a narrative-first fantasy RPG where every choice has consequences.
Magic comes from powerful Patrons—angels, demons, forgotten gods—and each spell incurs a debt they will collect. The dice don’t just say you win or lose; they generate complications that drive the story forward. In a world rebuilding from the ruins of a fallen empire, small actions change nations, and heroes shape the future—one risky decision at a time.

⸻

2. Cinematic, dramatic

In Fate’s Edge, power is real, magic is dangerous, and nothing is free. Cast a spell, swear an oath, or bargain with a Patron—and the world will remember. Every roll of the dice pushes the story forward, creating twists and consequences that reshape the world around you. Heroes rise from broken empires and contested frontiers, but fate always demands payment.

⸻

3. Player-centric, emotionally compelling

Fate’s Edge is a fantasy RPG where characters matter and choices echo. You can change the world, but every power comes with a price. Patrons offer magic in exchange for Obligation, and even success creates complications the story must explore. It’s a game where small decisions become epic consequences—and the world grows with you.

⸻

If you’d like, I can tighten one of these even further to exactly 2–3 sentences for a cover, website header, or product back. Which style do you prefer—#1, #2, or #3?

30-Second Spoken Trailer Script (with music cues)

Voiceover pacing: tense, cinematic, intentionally sparse.

⸻

[Low drums. A single bell tolls.]

VO:
In a world built from the ruins of a dead empire…
…power is bought with blood and bargains.

[Strings rise. The sound of a pen signing a contract.]

Magic isn’t free.
Every Patron—angel, demon, forgotten god—wants something back.

[Quick cut: steel scraping, a whispered spell, a scream cut short.]

Cast a Rite to save your friends…
…and the debt comes due.

[Music shifts darker.]

Here, the dice don’t just tell you yes or no.
They twist the story.
They light the fuse.

[Heartbeat. Crescendo.]

One blade.
One oath.
One desperate choice…

[Silence.]

VO (quiet, cold):
This is Fate’s Edge.
Power has a price.
And the world keeps the receipt.

[Impact hit → music cuts out.]

What is Fate’s Edge?

Fate’s Edge is a dark, character-driven fantasy tabletop RPG set in the shattered world of a fallen empire—where heroes rise from frontier towns, political intrigue, and ancient ruins… but power always comes at a price.

Magic is granted through Patrons—angels, demons, forgotten gods, and concepts that walk like people. Every spell you cast earns Obligation, a debt the Patron will eventually collect in dangerous, dramatic, story-changing ways.

You don’t just roll to succeed or fail.
You roll to reshape the narrative.

Fate’s Edge is built for groups that want consequences, character growth, and stories that remember what you did.

⸻

Why You’ll Love It

✅ Magic with real stakes – Every Rite you cast demands payment. Patrons have agendas. You can’t ignore them forever.
✅ Narrative-first mechanics – Every roll creates Story Beats, twists the GM must add to the unfolding tale.
✅ Fast, flexible characters – Skills, Bonds, and Complications define who you are and what you risk.
✅ Living world – Regions have personality, memory, and rules. From Valewood’s shifting ruins to Vhasia’s political duels, the world responds to you.
✅ Small choices → big consequences – Save a life, break a vow, anger a spirit… the world reacts.

⸻

The Core Mechanic

Fate’s Edge uses pools of d10s.
Every roll generates:
	•	Successes (you achieve your goal)
	•	Story Beats (complications the GM must introduce)
	•	Boons (story currency players can spend later)

Even a perfect roll might draw attention, start a chase, or reveal new threats.
Even a failure might grant Boons you desperately need.

This isn’t binary success/failure.
It’s cinematic tension, every time the dice hit the table.

⸻

Magic Isn’t Free

Instead of spell slots, Fate’s Edge uses Rites tied to Patrons.
	•	Light a pyre with the Pale Shepherd
	•	Whip crowds into frenzy with Thrysos, King of Revels
	•	Shape shadow with the Silent Choir
	•	Break oaths in Theona—and face the Green Host

Every Rite increases your Obligation.
When the meter fills, the Patron takes something:
	•	A dangerous mission
	•	A terrible choice
	•	A mark on your body or mind
	•	A binding geas
	•	A new Corruption

The more you borrow, the more you owe.
Power is tempting.
Power is expensive.

⸻

A World Rebuilding From Ruins

The Utaran Empire collapsed three centuries ago. In its wake:
	•	Ecktoria debates law while banks pull the strings
	•	Vhasia fights a cold war between rival claimants to the throne
	•	Kahfagia runs on bureaucracy, lantern-law, and sharp diplomacy
	•	Zakov sails knives and secrets on pirate tides
	•	Valewood reorders its ruins based on who trespasses
	•	Ubral honors clan oaths before imperial ghosts

This isn’t a static map—it’s a living frontier.
Small stories become world-shaking stories.

⸻
