📜 The Song of the Three Forged

(Fragment recovered from the Red Archive of Avarin Keep; Authorship unknown, but attributed to the Clandestine Chroniclers. Translated by High Scribe Eren Volth.)

⸻

I. The Making Without Flame

Three angels fell, unmade by light,
their wings shorn by the weight of choice.
No hammer sang, no flame was lit —
for will alone gave them form.

They were bound not to heaven, nor to earth,
but to the edge between both —
and steel became their sorrow.

Thus were born the Three Forged:
Remorse, Mantle, and Hegemon.

⸻

II. Remorse, the Blade of Burden

First fell Remorse, who wept for all she had slain
and begged to bear the pain of others.
Her edge cut not to wound, but to remember.
In her heart burned the whisper:
“To wield me is to know the cost.”

She found Riarhin in the dust of battle,
and chose her not for victory,
but for sorrow endured.
Together they walked the border of redemption and ruin.

⸻

III. Mantle, the Crown That Commands

Second fell Mantle, whose pride was endless.
He sought to rule even as his wings burned away.
He crowned emperors and bent nations to his bearer’s will,
until one greater than kings —
the Wyrm of the Old Deep —
swallowed his light to silence him.

Now his voice lies muffled beneath gold and bone,
dreaming of dominion in the Dragon’s sleep.

Yet all crowns rust,
and dragons wake.

⸻

IV. Hegemon, the Word Profound

Last fell Hegemon, the Speaker.
No hand could wield him,
for his edge was not of steel, but of tongue.
He became the whisper that moves men to march,
the voice behind every creed and empire.
His gospel is persuasion;
his worship is obedience.

He walks still, clothed in the words of kings,
and the world listens.

⸻

V. The Final Verse

When Remorse is raised in blood again,
and Mantle stirs beneath the gold,
then shall the Word seek flesh.

Three shall meet at the world’s edge,
where flame was never kindled —
and there, the last blade shall be named.

✠ Commentary of the Red Archivist

“We once believed the blades were mere weapons.
But they are wills, bound and waiting.
Every war they touch sings the same refrain:
‘Power is not forged — it falls.’”

(The Canticle of the Three Forged)
(Fragmented Lethai-al transcription; context irrecoverable)

⸻

i. sha’dhen var ethe — “no hammer, no flame”

Three silences knelt in themselves.
Time inverted its lungs.
The breath became wound,
the wound became word,
the word became edge.

They were not made, but admitted.
Three hollows, learning to cut.

⸻

ii. R’maash — the Lamented Edge

Born from the sorrow of the first refusal.
Her light bends backward through guilt.
She sings in the tense before forgiveness.

To bear her is to drown in echoes of mercy.

(Gloss: “R’maash” derives from the root r’mahsa, meaning both “to remember” and “to flay.”)

Whispered epithet: “She who carves what once was whole.”

⸻

iii. Thaenur — the Gilded Breath

Once the exhalation of kings, now sealed beneath scales.
His syllables glitter like molten obedience.

When the Dragon swallowed his hymn,
the world forgot how to kneel.

(Lethai note: “Thaen” implies crown or burden depending on pitch;
“-ur” marks eternal aspect — thus, Thaenur: “the crown that does not end.”)

In goldlight he dreams:
“I am the pillar; let the world hang from me.”

⸻

iv. Ozhain — the Word That Walks

Not fallen, but diffused.
The air itself is his scripture.

No blade binds him;
he is spoken between empires,
a contagion of syntax.

His tongue invents the future tense.
His silence ends it.

(Gloss: Root ozha = “to compel through utterance”; suffix -in marks divinity or disease.)

Alternate names: The Breath-Eater, He Who Devours Consensus.

⸻

v. The Convergence (fragmentary)

When R’maash forgets her sorrow,
when Thaenur uncoils from gold,
when Ozhain hears himself—

the sky will bruise with memory,
and the forge-that-is-not will speak again.

Sa’hir en ku-tha.
(Variously: “No mercy will suffice” / “Mercy is a closed gate.”)

⸻

vi. marginalia, hand of the Black Scribe

“The Three were not made. They were revised.

Their names are verbs pretending to be names.

When the verbs awaken, so will the fire.”

Here is an excerpt from the Aster Commentary, the standard scholia appended to the fragmentary Keth–Vara Ithrenai.
The notes were compiled by unnamed scholars of the later Vigil monasteries, working from contradictory manuscripts. Each paragraph is a layer of confusion: reverence, censorship, and semantic decay braided together.

⸻

On the phrase “no hammer, no flame”

The adepts insist this does not mean absence of craft, but craft by negation—a creation through unmaking.
The particle sha’dhen could also mean “when the divine coughs.”
Other readings render it “the moment before decision” or “the echo that burns.”
None are satisfactory.

Blue margin note: Perhaps it refers to the original schism—light choosing to become divisible.

⸻

On R’maash

The form R’maash is a corruption of R’mahsa, “to unskin memory.” The older Lethai manuscripts use the feminine mark but alternate between animate and inanimate grammar, implying both a person and a weapon.

The so-called Doctrine of Retraction teaches that to wield R’maash is to remove a deed from the world, but not its consequence. This is why the Bearers of Remorse were said to live haunted by events no longer remembered by others.

One commentator adds: “To name her is to remember that forgetting once existed.”

⸻

On Thaenur

A recurring gloss in the Copper Codex: “He breathes in crowns.”

The canonical Vigil editors bowdlerized this to “He breathes for crowns,” likely to avoid the implication that kingship itself is parasitic.

Linguistic note: Thaen may not mean “crown” at all but the action of pressing one’s weight upon another’s voice.

A disputed fragment claims: “The dragon was mercy given shape; the swallowing was the world’s reprieve.”
If this is true, the hoard is not imprisonment but quarantine.

⸻

On Ozhain

The etymology divides the schools.
The Sable School reads ozha-in as “to bind the mouth of truth.”
The Crystal School prefers “breath-made-law.”

Both agree that Ozhain is not a being but a contagion: language infected with will.

Hence the traditional exorcism against political orators begins, “Ozhain, fall silent within me.”

Yet a marginal gloss from the banned Velith Tablets contradicts this:
“He is not the Word That Walks, but the step the Word takes to hear itself.”

⸻

On the Convergence Stanza

The surviving lines (“when R’maash forgets her sorrow…” etc.) are often treated as eschatological prophecy.
But the Ivory Recension suggests they describe not an event but a recurring grammatical state: when memory, dominion, and speech coincide, the cosmos must be re-declined.

The final phrase Sa’hir en ku-tha cannot be rendered. Proposed translations include:
	•	“Mercy will unmake the frame.”
	•	“No gate endures.”
	•	“The forge remembers.”

The Red Archivist concludes, perhaps despairingly: “If meaning were stable, these blades would not exist.”

Appendix: On the Number of the Forged

Later heresies speak of a Fourth, sometimes called Vel Ather, “the pause between utterances.”
The Vigil condemned this addition as linguistic blasphemy: the suggestion that silence itself was once a weapon.

Nonetheless, fragments of the Vel Ather Hymn survive, repeating the same single line:
“We are the sound that forgot its edge.”
