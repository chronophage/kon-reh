Mistlands — “Bells, Salt, and Breath” 52-Card Generator

Spades — Places (fens, levees, bell-lines, shoreworks)
	2.	Reed-fen causey with chalked ward-runes on every milestone.
	3.	Bell-Line levee—iron posts, eight bells per span; one bracket is empty.
	4.	Ghost-ferry slip where the rope crosses black water; fares paid in salt.
	5.	Pall Watch-tower on piles above the mire; mirrors face west to the Direwood.
	6.	Mist-chapel on stilted planks; votive lanterns gutter under damp rafters.
	7.	Dead-cut canal (old imperial ditch) now patrolled by eel boats and law.
	8.	Drowned-copse shore; root-tangles clutch the tide like old hands.
	9.	Fogmill ridge—wind vanes vanish into cloud; gears hiss like prayers.
	10.	Salt-pan terraces patched with peat; ward-salt dries under nets.
J. Protectorate Fort-Stair of stacked timber and stone, flags swallowed by mist.
Q. Witchlight Bridge over a black runnel; the ninth plank is “counted” but unseen.
K. High-Mist Pass through the Aelerians; cairns ringed in iron nails.
A. Weeping Gate—western palisade facing the Direwood, bells wired to the bones of trees.

	3.	Salt-monk who blesses pans and keeps the ward-measure honest.

Q. Legate of the Mists (Aeler governor), equal parts mercy and decree.
K. Lord Warden of the Fens, local strong hand sworn to the Legate’s seal.

Clubs — Complications/Threats (undead, weather, law, neighbors)
	2.	Ground-mist lifts off the fen and eats tracks by the yard.
	3.	Witchlights try to count you; step wrong and the bridge forgets you.
	4.	Ward-salt short—pans go green; bells ring, nothing answers.
	5.	Wrong bell—a cracked note opens a door the Legate can’t close.
	6.	Linn raid slips the reed-maze; hearths douse, horns travel.
	7.	Direwood moan at dusk; the Weeping Gate ropes go taut by themselves.

	3.	Ferry token—cross a named black runnel regardless of curfew.
	4.	Bell-key—unlock and set one bell on the Line to your note.

K. Warden’s commission—raise levee guards; local doors open, purses too.

Quick use notes
	•	Draw until all four suits appear: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main clock (2–5 → 4, 6–10 → 6, J/Q/K → 8, A → 10).
	•	Diamonds are codified outcomes (passes/seals/tokens) that change position rather than call for a roll.
	•	If any A appears, echo breath and boundary—bells answering each other across water, salt that won’t quite dry, voices that return a heartbeat late.
