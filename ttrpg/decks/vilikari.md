Quick use notes
	•	Draw until all four suits appear: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2–5→4, 6–10→6, J/Q/K→8, A→10).
	•	Diamonds are codified outcomes (charters/rights/escorts) that shift position rather than call for a roll.
	•	If any A shows, echo the two-laws motif—wolf and eagle side by side, or the Foedus Stone watching—across later scenes.
