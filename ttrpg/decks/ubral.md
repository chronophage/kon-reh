Quick use notes
	•	Draw until you have all four suits: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2–5→4, 6–10→6, J/Q/K→8, A→10).
	•	Diamonds are codified outcomes (oaths/rights/tokens) that change position rather than call for a roll.
	•	If any A appears, echo upland motifs—horns, heather, stone—in later scenes for cohesion.
