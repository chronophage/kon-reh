Quick use notes
	•	Draw 4 to seed: Spade = place, Heart = actor, Club = pressure, Diamond = leverage. Highest rank sets the main Clock (2–5 → 4, 6–10 → 6, J/Q/K → 8, A → 10).
	•	Diamonds = codified outcomes (rights/papers/charters) that shift position rather than call for a roll.
	•	If any A appears, echo the broken-sun motif: a blotted medal, a sunburst scratched off a milestone, a loyalist hymn under someone’s breath.
