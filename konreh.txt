Kon’reh — Rules of Play
Diamond Board Strategy for Two Players
Adjudication. If an example or annotation conflicts with the rules text, the rules text governs.
Aqyl of Thepyrgos, in 538 A.R., went up and down the Amaranthine collecting every form of
the Imperial Game, Canray. He hinted at what those of us who served under Black Banners
already knew: the Ykrul set the first board. In Utaran he titled it On the Imperial Game, Being
a Most Complete and Faithful Corpus of Its Laws, Variants, and the Dispositions of the Peoples
Who Play It. In Vhasian rolls it appears simply as Corpus Canré. It was banned as contrary
to the health of the empire. After the Edict of Colonia Victrix (Laveus Cordus), On Indecent
Letters in 553 A.R., only a few poor translations circulated. The handful of originals remaining
are scattered in private libraries; jealously guarded by aficionados and lords such as myself.
I have made this Corpus Canré Scholiatum to serve the present age. I collated what could be
found, set the Utaran back in its places, corrected imperial glosses, and regularized the names
where the documents agree. I add tables and diagrams fit for students, with notes from banner
service and the river houses. If there is error, it is mine. The game is older than our names for
it. The Tulughma Host1 taught it to us; the Empire dressed it in roads and law.
Duke Braedon Fenwood (in the old hand: B. V. Velvano III), Tarlington, Ashing Year 862 A.R.
Kon’reh is a deterministic, perfect-information strategy game played on an 8×8 diamond grid.
Each player commands a Blue (royal), two Oranges (officers), six Reds (line), and one Green (raider).
Control space with Zones of Control (ZoC), invest tempo with Sanctum spawns, and—if your Blue
falls—race a five-turn Reforge to return it.
Rules at a Glance
ZoC ends moves• Blue: slide→1 special (no special→slide; no special after entering ZoC)•
Seed roots Blue; cap 6 Greens total• Cross: stay up to 3 of your turns; after leaving, 2-turn
exclusion • Reforge: 5 of your turns to plant and return Blue.
1 Objective
You win by capturing the opponent’s Blue and then preventing its return during their
Reforge countdown (Section 6); or if the opponent concedes. There are no other automatic wins.
Lore→Mechanics Rosetta — Core Terms
Use this as a bridge from fiction to play. Tournament core is unchanged. Optional content defaults
off unless agreed before clocks start.
Board & Pieces
1Also called the “Encircling” or “Ring” Host; “Kapqan Horde” in other steppe tongues.
1
Core Rhythms (“Five Clocks”)
Global Green Cap. At most 6 Greens total may be on the board at any time (combined across
both players).
Tracking Aids (recommended at table)
Marker Qty What it tracks / When to adjust
Blue special markers “H/D” Rooted marker Cross stay pips (0–3) Cross exclusion pips (0–2) Reforge counter (5→0) Global Green-cap dial (0–6) 2 per player Flip when that Blue has used Hop or Displacement
(this life). Refresh on Reforge (and via Buyback if
used).
1 per player Place after Seed or after the second Blue special
(Crown Stagger). Remove at start of owner’s next
turn.
3 per player Increment when your turn ends with Blue in the Cen-
tral Four; reset to 0 after a turn ends outside.
2 per player After leaving the Four, count your next two turns
before re-entry; decrement each of your turns.
1 per player Set to 5 when Blue is captured; decrement at end of
each of your turns; clear on a successful plant.
1 shared Total Greens on board. Increase on entry (Seed/re-
turn), decrease on capture/plant.
Minimal kit: special markers, one d6 per side for Reforge, and a shared 0–6 dial for the Green cap.
Optional: turn marker; Buyback-used and Mobilization flags for tournaments.
Setup
From your Home Apex outward, fill the first four ranks (lengths 1–2–3–4):
• R1 (length 1): Blue on the Home Apex.
• R2 (length 2): 2 Oranges (both squares).
• R3 (length 3): Red – Green – Red (left to right from your view).
• R4 (length 4): 4 Reds (fill the row).
The opponent mirrors from the opposite corner.
A = white stones; B = black stones; B/G/O/R = Blue, Green, Orange, Red.
2 Turn Order
Players alternate turns, one move per turn. As opening balance, the second player takes two
moves on their first turn (back-to-back). They may not move the same piece twice during that
opening double move. All other rules (ZoC, captures, Seed, Cross, etc.) apply normally.

3 Basic Movement, Capture & Zone of Control (ZoC)
Lanes & Directions
Everysquareconnectstofourdiagonallanes: Onward-Left(OL)andOnward-Right(OR)—both
toward the Opposing Apex; and Homeward-Left (HL) and Homeward-Right (HR)—both
toward your Home Apex. A move travels along one lane without turning; all intermediate squares
must be empty.
Piece Movement & Capture
Piece Onward (exact) Homeward (up to) Capture
Red (Line) 2 1 by displacement (move onto enemy square)
Orange (Officer) 3 2 by displacement
Green (Raider) 4 3 by displacement
Blue (Royal) 5 4 see Section 3.1
No passing through pieces. You cannot move through occupied squares. A move stays on one
3
lane (no mid-move turns).
Zone of Control (ZoC)
Every piece exerts ZoC on the four adjacent diagonal squares (one step along OL, OR, HL,
HR). You may enter an enemy ZoC square (including to capture), but entering enemy ZoC
ends your move immediately. You cannot move through ZoC.
3.1 Blue’s Movement & Specials
Blue moves along the four lanes (OL/OR/HL/HR) as listed in the Movement table and interacts
with ZoC like any piece: it may enter enemy ZoC, but any slide ends upon entry. (ZoC does not
block a legal special.)
Capture specials (per Blue life). A Blue has two one-use capture specials, refreshed when it
returns via Reforge. In any Blue turn you may use at most one special, and you may slide then
special. After a special resolves, that Blue’s movement for the turn is over (no special→slide).
(a) Displacement — Move one step along a lane onto an adjacent enemy; remove it.
(b) Hop-capture — Jump over one adjacent enemy along the same lane to the empty square
immediately beyond; remove the jumped enemy. (Blue cannot hop without capturing.)
Rules Note — ZoC and Blue Specials
Legal. Blue may use hop-capture or displacement even if the landing square lies inside enemy ZoC;
captures end the move. Blue may also begin its turn standing in ZoC and use a special from there.
Not legal. You may not slide into enemy ZoC and then use a special on the same turn: entering
ZoC by sliding immediately ends the move.
Example. From adjacency, Blue may hop over an enemy into an empty square that is in ZoC. But
“slide one step into ZoC to become adjacent, then hop” is illegal.
Crown Stagger (core). When your Blue uses its second capture special in the same Blue life
(one Hop and one Displacement, in any order), then at the end of that turn your Blue becomes
Rooted until your next turn begins. It still exerts ZoC and may be captured. Blue never
promotes.
4 Twin Apex Seed (Spawning Greens)
If your Blue ends its move on a Sanctum, you may spawn one Green on the opposite
Sanctum (if empty and the Global Green Cap is not exceeded). After seeding, that Blue becomes
Rooted (it may not move) until your next turn begins.
Mobilization Seed-Delay (scope). On the first turn that a given Blue leaves its Home Apex for
that Blue’s current life, you cannot use Twin Apex Seed, even if it ends that move on a Sanctum.
This restriction resets each time that Blue returns via Reforge (i.e., each new Blue life).
4
Rules Note — Mobilization Delay & Reforge→Sanctum Seeding
Mobilization delay. A Blue may not Seed on that Blue’s first departure from Home in its current
life. (Being placed on a Sanctum by Reforge is not a departure.)
Reforge→Sanctum, then Seed from the opposite (allowed). A Blue placed by Reforge on
Sanctum A may later end a turn on Sanctum B and Seed, spawning the Green on Sanctum A, without
ever visiting Home, provided:
• the opposite Sanctum is empty;
• the global Green cap is <6;
• the Blue is not Rooted.
The same-Sanctum banforbids Seeding only from the exact Sanctum used for the Reforge placement;
Mobilization delay applies only on the Blue’s first departure from Home in that life.
5 Central Four (the “Cross”)
The Cross is the 2×2 diamond of squares at board center. Only Blue has special timing there:
• A Blue may enter and occupy the Cross normally.
• Stay limit: A given Blue may remain in the Cross for at most 3 of its own turns (not
counting the opponent’s turns). Exceeding this is illegal; the Blue must exit before its fourth
turn in the Cross.
• Exclusion on exit: After a Blue leaves the Cross, it cannot re-enter the Cross for the
next 2 of its turns.
Illegal CF end (a fourth stay) is rewound to the start of that move; choose a legal move. Tournament
penalties, see D.
Rules Note — Cross Timers & the Opening Double-Move
No opening interaction. From the normal setup, neither side can enter the Central Four on their
first turn; P2’s double-move does not affect Cross counters.
Stays & Exclusion (general).
• Stay increases only if your turn ends with your Blue on a Cross square.
• Exclusion begins only when that same Blue later leaves the Cross after a counted stay.
• Example timeline: Turn N: Blue enters ⇒[CF : in 1/3]. Turn N+1: still inside ⇒[in 2/3]. Turn
N+2: exits ⇒[ex 1/2]. Turn N+3: [ex 2/2]. Turn N+4: re-entry allowed.
Central Four (“Cross”) — Summary Effect
Enter Cross Stay timer Exit Re-entry Legal; normal ZoC applies.
Max 3 of that Blue’s turns inside.
Must leave before its 4th own turn while in-Cross.
Excluded for the next 2 of that Blue’s turns.
5
6 Reforge (Blue Return After Capture)
When your Blue is captured, a five-turn countdown begins: you have 5 of your own turns to
plant a banner by occupying the enemy Home Apex with any one of your pieces. If you fail,
you lose immediately.
Plant → Remove Runner → Return Blue (choose placement pay cost)
On the turn you occupy the enemy Home Apex:
1. Plant the banner: End your move on the enemy Home Apex.
2. Remove the runner: The occupying piece leaves play (remove it).
3. Place your Blue: Choose one of:
• Opposing Apex — sacrifice one of your Greens (the runner may pay).
• Either Sanctum — that Blue may never Seed from that same Sanctum later.
• Your Home Apex — no cost.
4. Blue refresh: A reforged Blue returns with both capture specials unused (fresh life).
Default Time & Start-Balance Rule
Core default. In all ranked/tournament play, Kon’r¯eh uses a 10+5 Fischer time control (10
minutes base with +5 seconds added after each move) and the P2 double-move start-balance.
This default applies unless an event specifies different settings or both players agree otherwise.
Casual or learning games may disregard it.
Rationale. A 10+5 increment preserves endgame quality without devolving into flagging,
and P2 double-move is the standard balance for bases >4 minutes. For bases ≤4 minutes,
organizers may optionally use the pie rule for balance.
See also. Details and alternatives in §D.6 and Table 2.
7 Quick Reference
Movement & Capture (summary)
Piece Onward (exact) Homeward (up to) Capture
Red 2 1 displacement
Orange 3 2 displacement
Green 4 3 displacement
Blue 5 4 specials only (see below)
Key: onL k/hmR k = lane-tagged slides; [S:H]/[S:D] = Blue specials; [CF:in 1/3] = Cross timer; [Rooted]= Rooted;
[RC]= Reforge; [G:2–1] = Greens on board.
6
Lane-tagged slides. Whenever a rule or example specifies a slide, we may write the lane explicitly:
onOL k, onOR k, hmHL k, hmHR k. These tags name the exact Onward/Homeward lane used. Blue
specials (Hop, Displacement) are annotated separately and are not written with step counts.
Notation (Lanes and Steps)
Squares are indexed by lanes (o,h): your Onward lane o (toward the opponent’s apex) and
your Homeward lane h (toward your own apex). We write moves with lane tags:
Lane tags Slides Un-tagged Specials Timers OL=Onward-Left, OR=Onward-Right, HL=Homeward-Left, HR=Homeward-Right.
onL 2 means slide two steps along your OL lane; hmR 1 one step along HR.
If a tag is omitted (e.g., on 2), the intended lane is clear from diagram or context.
A: [S:H] (Hop used); B: [S:D] (Displacement used).
[CF:in 1/3]/[CF:ex 1/2] = Cross counters; [Rooted] = Rooted; [RC] = Reforge; [G:2–1] =
Greens on board (A–B).
Lane tags are board-standard on the diamond: “left/right” are relative to your Onward/Homeward
facing, not compass points.
ZoC (summary)
Each piece projects ZoC to the four diagonal-adjacent squares (one step along OL, OR, HL, HR).
Entering ZoC ends your move.
Blue Specials (summary)
• One special max per Blue turn. May slide, then use one special.
• Displacement (×1/life): Step one square along the current lane onto an adjacent enemy;
remove it.
• Hop (×1/life): Jump over one adjacent enemy along the same lane to the empty square
immediately beyond; remove the jumped enemy.
• Movement + special: Blue may slide and then use one special unless the slide
entered enemy ZoC.
Twin Apex Seed (summary)
End Blue’s move on a Sanctum →spawn a Green on the opposite Sanctum (if empty, cap OK) →
that Blue is Rooted until your next turn. Cannot Seed on Blue’s first departure from Home Apex.
Central Four (“Cross”) (summary)
Max 3 of that Blue’s turns inside; after exiting, cannot re-enter for 2 of its turns.
Violations. Rewind to the last legal position before the illegal end-of-turn and enforce a legal
move.
7
Reforge (summary)
1. Capture Blue →defender gets 5 of their turns to plant a banner (occupy enemy Home
Apex).
2. On plant: remove runner →place Blue at Opposing Apex (sacrifice a Green), or either
Sanctum (no Seed from that Sanctum for this life), or Home Apex (free).
3. Blue returns with both specials unused.
Timing Notes
• The five-turn count advances after each of your turns.
• If the capture occurs during the second player’s opening double-move, the defender still receives
a full five of their turns thereafter.
Win: Opponent fails Reforge after you capture their Blue.
Draws (by agreement or adjudication):
• Stalemate/mutual blockade: No legal progress toward Blue capture or banner plant is
reasonably possible for either side. Organizers may apply a move-count rule (e.g., 50 full turns
without a capture or Seed).
• Threefold repetition: The same position (including all timers/flags/counters) with the
same player to move occurs three times. See Tournament Options (Optional)
Concession ends the game immediately.
8 Illegal Moves & Clarifications
• Moves travel along a single lane (OL/OR toward Opposing Apex; HL/HR toward Home
Apex) with no mid-move turns; no passing through pieces.
• You cannot move through enemy ZoC; you may enter ZoC (including to capture), but
entering enemy ZoC ends your move.
• Only Blue can hop, and only as a hop-capture along its current lane.
• You cannot Seed if the opposite Sanctum is occupied or doing so would exceed the Global
Green Cap.
• The Reforge runner may be any of your pieces.
• Blue may slide then use one special (if legal); it may not use both specials in the same turn.
9 Table Etiquette (recommended)
Keep a five-turn counter for Reforge, two markers to track Blue’s specials, and six beads for
the global Green cap. Announce “Seed” and “Reforge” aloud to avoid ambiguity. When in doubt,
replay from the last clear position.
Kon’reh rewards clarity. Forward is commitment; sideways is breath. Seed for tomorrow; map your Reforge
today.

11 Strategy & Training Guide
“I watched an Oshiiran marshal play not for squares but for throughput. He hung two lanterns
on the market’s edge and called them exits; the crowd did not see the lamps were certificates2
When his Blue stepped into the desert, he drank once, twice, thrice—and never a fourth3. The
merchants with drums called this caution. It was geometry.
.
He did not harvest material; he priced routes. The first Orange set the levy where feet must fall,
the Reds laid bridges not to cross but to close behind. When a Sanctum answered, his captain
rooted himself like a quartermaster with both hands on the ledger4, and from the opposite quay a
Green packet slid out with the tide.
You will say this is slow. It is only quiet. See how the five dawns were counted before the first
strike: a depot planted far; a lane welded late; a Cross touched and left with dignity; a runner
shown and then priced away; the banner race forced to end on a bookkeeper’s page. The victory
was not a blow but a balance: when every profitable road belonged to him, the other player resigned
like a caravan turning at a toll.”
— rendered by Aqyl of Thypergos, fol.212v–213r
(Concordance c.802, from Safiya’s Diw¯an of the Long Road)
Core Mental Models
ZoC as a graph. Treat the board as a movement graph along four lanes (two Onward, two Homeward).
Enemy ZoC prunes edges. Strong play is about cutting exits before you threaten captures.
Blue as a finite resource. Your Blue carries exactly two capture specials per life (one Displacement, one
Hop). Track both sides’ specials; this largely dictates when Sanctum Seed is safe.
Countdown as a subgame. After Blue capture, play reduces to a 5-turn shortest-path race to the enemy
Home Apex under ZoC constraints. Greens are the premium runners; lane geometry and ZoC matter more
than material.
Central Four (“Cross”) as a timer. The center grants leverage with a fuse: at most 3 of that Blue’s own
turns inside, then a 2-turn exclusion after exit. Enter with a precomputed exit.
Opening Principles
1. Second player’s double-move is a real tempo lever: develop a Red lattice and an Orange probe, or
an Orange plus a safe Blue sidestep.
2. Mobilize Blue early (don’t turtle on Home Apex); the first departure cannot Seed, so plan your
second Sanctum touch to align with an SSI-safe window.
3. Build backward bridges (retreating Reds along Homeward lanes) to pre-wire banner denial later.
Midgame Patterns
Seed windows. Best after you’ve taxed or tracked out an enemy Blue special, or when R≥2 (their Blue
needs at least two of their turns to reach capture contact). Screen with an Orange fork or a Red bridge.
Cross re-entry. Re-enter only off a prior threat (e.g., forcing their lattice to rotate two of their turns away).
Otherwise pivot to Sanctum →Seed.
2The translator glosses Safiya’s ‘lanterns’ as the Oshiiran practice of proving two certain exits before a central
incursion; cf. our XS (Exit Certainty).
3Safiya’s ‘desert’ is the central four. Her ‘three drinks’ aligns with the Cross stay limit of three turns.
4Safiya’s image of the ‘rooted quartermaster’ foreshadows the modern Rooted state after Seed and the Crown
Stagger consequence of spending both Blue captures in a single life.
11
Double-capture theatrics. Blue captures in the Central Four are strong on open boards; ensure at least
one certified exit (XS) before you strike.
Endgame Cues
Before you capture a Blue: can you deny a 5-turn banner without opening a counter-capture? If not,
improve your ZoC first.
As the defender: prioritize lane welding—one Red to cut a file, one Orange to print a fork two turns ahead
of the runner.
Common Traps & Counters
• Rooted Punish: Capturing a freshly Seeded Blue with a saved special. Counter: respect SSI; don’t
Seed into R≤1 with S≥1.
• Telegraphed Cross: Re-entering the Central Four right after exclusion into a pre-built lattice.
Counter: Sanctum pivot →Seed.
• Apex Overreach: Aggressive Reforge onto the Opposing Apex with high enemy density. Counter:
prefer Home/Sanctum unless the EV is proven.
Training Drills (15–20 min each)
D1 — Rooted Trap Ladder. Place your Blue on a Sanctum. Vary opponent Blue range (R=1,2,3
turns to capture contact) and specials (S=0,1,2). Play 10 reps each; attacker tries to punish Seed, defender
times safe Seeds. Log SSI outcomes.
D2 — Cap Sprints. Start at Greens 3–2 with cap at 4. One side aims to force cap to 6 before a Blue
trade; the other aims to peel one Green first. Swap sides.
D3 — Cross Re-entry Gauntlet. Attacker’s Blue regains Central Four eligibility; defender alternates
between “prepared lattice” and “unprepared.” Attacker must name XS before entering; play 6 reps.
D4 — Two-Turn Welds. After suffering a Cross capture, defender gets two turns to seal exits (Red
cut + Orange fork). Repeat until the defender consistently denies all certified exits.

1. Gate test: Can you name the square every route crosses? If yes, capture it; if empty, place on it.

2. Deadline test: After this move, will your best plant time T∗ be ≤D (for you) or their T∗ >D? If no,
don’t start a race.
3. Cap test: If a capture opens cap, who seeds first safely? If not you, prefer placement.
4. Redundancy test: If your move doesn’t push κv (you: 1→2 or opp: 2→1), it must at least add +1 to
∆T∗—else it’s cosmetic.

11.1 Beginner Onboarding (Optional Modes)
These two intro modes let new players learn movement, ZoC, clocks, and Reforge without the full cognitive
load. Start with Micro-Kon’reh, then graduate to Tutor Kon’reh, and finally flip back to full rules.
1. Micro-Kon’reh (6×6 Diamond)
Purpose: teach ZoC, tempos, and Reforge with minimal load.
• Board: 6×6 diamond (ranks of length 1–2–3–4–5–6–5–4–3–2–1).
• Setup per side: Row 1: Blue on Home Apex. Row 2: 1 Orange (inner), 1 Red (outer). Row 3: 3 Reds.
No Green at start.
• Removed rules: Twin Apex Seed; Central Four stay/exclusion timers.
• Blue specials: only one total—upon first use, choose hop-capture or displacement; the other locks.
• Reforge: countdown is 3 of your turns (not 5).
• Recommended length: 10–20 moves (demo/teaching).
• Crown Stagger: N/A in this mode (Blue has only one special total).
2. Tutor Kon’reh (Full Board, No Seed)
Purpose: restore the Cross while keeping load low.
• Board: standard 8×8 diamond; normal setup.
• Removed rule: Twin Apex Seed only (no Green generation).
• Blue specials: both available; normal usage limits apply.
• Reforge: normal 5–turn countdown.
• Progression: after 2–3 games, re-enable Seed and proceed to full rules.
Basic Mode (Teaching Toggles)
Use exactly one toggle for first games:
• Basic–CF: Ignore Cross exclusion (no 2–turn re-entry ban). CF stay cap (3) still applies.
• Basic–Mobilization: Ignore Mobilization delay (Blue may Seed on its first departure).
Do not use both at once. Record which toggle was used on the scoresheet.
3. No-Capture Walkthrough (5–8 Turns)
Purpose: teach lanes, ZoC, and CF timing without combat.
• Rule tweak: For the first 5–8 turns total, no captures and no Blue specials. Sliding only.
• Coach cue: Each side must (i) enter and exit the Central Four once, and (ii) build one simple “bridge”
(one Red behind one Orange).
• Debrief: Point out where a capture would have ended inside ZoC; name the CF stay/exile counters you
burned.
15
4. Pie–Rule Training (Swap After First Ply)
Purpose: provide a balance switch alternative to the P2 double-move.
• Replace the standard P2 double-move with the pie rule.
• Sequence: P1 makes exactly one opening move (no Blue special). P2 then chooses:
– “As is” — keep sides and play a normal single move as P2; or
– “Swap” — exchange sides/colors with P1; the game proceeds with normal single-move turns.
• Note: Do not combine pie rule with the P2 double-move in the same game.
5. Seed Tutor (Two Safe Windows)
Purpose: teach Rooted, Seed windows, and “seed safety” checks.
• Setup: Standard 8×8. Begin midgame-ish by agreement or after the No-Capture Walkthrough.
• Rule tweak: Each side gets exactly two opportunities to perform Twin Apex Seed during the session.
• Coach cue: Before a Seed, say aloud: “Opposite Sanctum empty; mobilization delay satisfied; their Blue
cannot punish next turn.” If any fail, no Seed.
• Debrief: Mark whether the Seed survived the Rooted turn and why.
First-Session Goals (Say These Out Loud)
By the end of the first game, each player should:
• Touch the Central Four once with a planned exit; name the stay (1/3) and then the exile (1/2).
• Build a basic lane weld (Red behind Orange) and point at a square that ends moves by ZoC.
• Perform one safe Seed (or decline it) after a verbal seed-safety check.
• Explain what happens if Blue is captured (five-turn Reforge outline).
Common New-Player Pitfalls (Spot & Stop)
• Camping the Cross: Trying to “hold” center beyond three turns. Enter to pivot, not to pose.
• Early Rooted: Seeding on Blue’s first departure (mobilization delay!) or into a live punish.
• Chasing, not sealing: Moving toward a runner instead of welding its penultimate and forking
the reroute.
• Second special for tempo: Spending both Blue specials in one life to “look active” — then
dying to Crown Stagger.
6. Ten-Minute Teach Script (Coach Prompts)
1. Footwork: Slide an Orange far; show ZoC ends. Ask: “Where does their next move stop?”
2. Center as Timer: Enter CF, count “one of three,” exit next turn; point at exile “one of two.”
3. Bridge: Place Red behind Orange; ask which square now ends in ZoC.
4. Seed Window: Move Blue to Sanctum; perform the safety mantra. If safe, Seed; if not, explain why.
16
5. What-if Reforge: Describe the five-turn race and the three return choices (Home / Sanctum /
Opposing Apex).
Practical Heuristics
H1 — Seed Safety Index (SSI). Let R be the minimum number of opponent turns needed for their
Blue, via a legal lane path, to make capture contact with your Blue on a Sanctum (adjacent for Displacement,
or a Hop over one screen to an empty square beyond). Let S ∈{0,1,2}be their specials remaining.
• If S ≥1 and R≤1 ⇒Unsafe: do not Seed (Rooted Blue is punishable).
• If S = 0 or R≥2 ⇒Safe: Seed is usually correct (respect local tactics).
• Borderline (S = 1, R= 2): Seed only with two independent screens (e.g., Red + Orange forming
non-collinear ZoC), or if their Blue is Cross-excluded.
Rule of thumb: A saved special + one-turn reach makes Rooted Blue bait.
Designer Note — Heuristics Are Handles, Not Handcuffs
The SSI/XS/CCA “rules of thumb” are defaults, not laws. Creativity in Kon’reh lives in the justified
exception. We tag each guideline as Hard (rarely break), Soft (often context-dependent), or Bait
(profitable to violate when listed triggers occur).
Examples.
• XS ≥2 (Soft). Break at XS= 1 if the opponent’s Blue has no specials and your exit converts to a
Sanctum pivot.
• SSI ≥1 (Soft). Seed at SSI= 0 only when a forced reply restores safety (their hop must capture
into your weld).
• Ring over Cross (Bait). Take an XS= 0 Cross hit if it induces a double threat that forces them
to reopen your only exit.
Meta evolves: They reflect current best practice, not doctrine.
H2 — Cap Clock Advantage (CCA). With the global Green cap (6) approaching, push the cap
only when:
• You lead in Greens or own the wider banner lane (more non-ZoC nodes toward their Home Apex), and
• You can immediately deny their fastest two banner paths after a Blue exchange.
Otherwise stall the cap; peel or trade off one enemy Green first.
H3 — Cross Exit Certainty (XS). Before entering (or capturing inside) the Cross, count exits that
cannot be ZoC-sealed within the opponent’s next two turns.
• XS — Exit Certainty: Count distinct safe exits next turn if you enter the Cross or raid.
• Enter at XS ≥1 (playable); XS = 2 is safest. Avoid XS = 0.
H4 — Reforge Placement EV (intuitive). Opposing Apex placement trades a Green and risks
instant recapture; Sanctum trades future Seed rights on that same Sanctum; Home is safest. Unless the enemy
Blue has S = 0, is Cross-excluded, and local piece density is low, prefer Home ≥Sanctum ≫Opposing
Apex.
17
H5 — Stagger Risk Index (SRI). Before spending your second special, check the landing square:
SRI=2 (safe outside Central Four with cover), SRI=1 (borderline), SRI=0 (punishable: Central Four tangle
or adjacent threats). Avoid SRI<1 unless the follow-up is forced winning.
Director’s note (tournaments): Adjudicated draws are recommended (e.g., 50 full turns without capture
or Seed; or mutual blockade). Provide two beads per Blue to track specials and a die/track for the 5-turn
Reforge.
Timing Notes
• The five-turn count advances after each of your turns.
• If the capture occurs during the second player’s opening double-move, the defender still receives a full
five of their turns thereafter.
Five Clocks (Summary)
• Cross Stay (CF) — A Blue may end at CF for up to 3 of its own turns (per life).
• Cross Exile — After leaving CF, the Blue cannot re-enter for 2 of its own turns.
• Rooted (Seed) — A Blue that Seeds is immobile until its next turn (still capturable).
• Crown Stagger — After using both specials (H and D) in one life, the Blue Roots at end of
that turn.
• Reforge Countdown — If Blue is captured, its owner has 5 turns to plant on the enemy
Home Apex.
11.2 Win conditions. End of Game, Draws, Concessions
A game is won immediately by the first of:
• Reforge timeout. A side whose Blue was captured fails to plant a banner before its Reforge counter
reaches 0 on its own turn end.
• Resignation. A player concedes the game.
• Time forfeit. In timed play, a player’s clock expires (director adjudication).
Draw conditions. A game is drawn by the first of:
• Mutual agreement. Players agree to a draw.
• Stalemate. The player to move has no legal move.
5
• Threefold repetition (upon claim). The same position with the same player to move occurs three
times (not necessarily consecutively); see the callout below for what “same position” means.
• 50–turn no–progress (tournament option). If adopted, a director may declare a draw after 50 full
turns without either a capture or a Seed; see §??.
5Passes are not permitted under the core rules.
18
Threefold Repetition — Position Equivalence
A “same position” requires equality of all state that affects legal moves or future claims, not just piece
locations. Two positions are identical iff all of the following match:
1. Side to move.
2. Board occupancy. Type and location of every piece.
3. Blue special usage (per side, this life). Which of Hop and Displacement remain unused.
4. Rooted flags (per side). Whether a Blue is Rooted.
5. Central Four counters (per side). Current stay count (0–3) and exclusion count (0–2).
6. Reforge counters (per side). Current 5→0 value, or “not running.”
7. Sanctum restrictions (per Blue, this life). Whether a Blue is barred from Seeding from a
specific Sanctum due to a prior Sanctum Reforge placement.
8. Mobilization status (per Blue, this life). Whether that Blue has left Home at least once
(affects Seed eligibility).
9. Global Green count. Total Greens on the board (0–6).
10. Active tournament options (if any). Any option that affects legality (e.g., Crown Buyback
availability/usage) must be in the same state.
How to claim. Pause play (or stop clocks), announce the claim before making your next move, and
identify the three occurrences (move numbers/diagrams). The director confirms and awards the draw;
otherwise play resumes with the claimant to move.
Illegal position remedy. If an illegal move is discovered, rewind to the last legal position and require a
legal move instead. For the specific “fourth consecutive end–in–Cross” violation and suggested penalties, see
§??.

12 Schools, Variants & Play Styles
“A game is a road; every people paves their mile.” — Aqyl of Thepyrgos
Choose Your School
Use this as a style on-ramp. These are doctrines, not rules; the tournament core never changes.
School You’ll like this if... First plan (3–5 turns)
Viterran (Canray) You enjoy control—building fences
and slow squeezes.
Aeler (K’thra) You think in ledgers and price every
step.
Vilikari (Kanry) You love tempo theft and misdirec-
tion.
Thepyrgosi (Ora-
tor’s)
You savor parity binds and zugzwang. Ubral (Highland) You prefer edge weather and hidden
routes.
Silkstrand (Bravo) You like flourish into harvest (tactics
that look flashy but cash out).
You want inevitability, not attrition. Lethai (“Single-
Stroke”)
Ykrul (Steppe) You thrive on timers, denial, prag-
matic trades.
Vhasian (Imperial) You like showmanship and clean
tempo trades.
Weld a corridor at home, refuse Central Four
early, then Seed midgame when their exits
(XS) are low. If Blue falls, Reforge Home to
reset the structure.
Set sideways “toll posts” with Orange to make
bad routes expensive. Seed only when SSI↑
and cap pressure pays interest; favor Home
for stability.
Throw an off-beat Orange probe, touch Cen-
tral Four only with XS≥1, bank one Blue
special, then pivot to a Seed window you cre-
ated two beats earlier.
Mirror to freeze parity; use Central Four to
force inevitabilities (not trades). Delay Seed-
ing until every reply cedes tempo; prefer Home
on Reforge.
Sell porous edges, feint retreats, then appear
“four-exact” from fog. Ignore Central Four
unless it opens an edge gate; Seed off an edge
pivot; Reforge Home.
Telegraph a hop, sidestep to Sanctum, then
Seed off the pulled screens; keep one special
banked. Reforge Sanctum to keep pressure.
Deny Seeds, manage the cap, build twin back-
ward bridges. Treat Central Four as a timer,
not a brawl. Capture Blue only when the five
clocks already bust their Reforge.
Track [CF in a/3] strictly, enforce the 2-turn
exile, clamp a Sanctum lane, delay a safe Seed,
andtradetowardafailedReforgeontheirside.
Touch Cross to call the duel (only with ex-
its), Seed to the opposite Sanctum to start a
quiet lane, and reserve one Blue special for
the finishing tactic; avoid Stagger traps.
For table maxims that pair well with any school, see the Black Banner Table (Articles & Primer).
How to Use This Section
All schools below play the same rules. Differences are doctrine, priorities, naming, and table etiquette. Treat
these as study notes for the current meta (Central Four timer, two-turn re-entry exclusion, second-player
double-move, SSI/XS/CCA), not extra rules.

Ykrul School (Kon’reh)
Doctrine. Control before contact. Build ZoC nets that erase corridors; spend low-value Reds to burn exits.
Typical lines. Early homeward bridges with Reds; Blue sidesteps to Sanctum only when opponent Blue
specials are taxed (SSI-safe); Central Four used as a puncture, not a camp.
Seed timing. After confirming SSI safety (opponent Blue out of range or out of specials).
Pre-build root squares; collect Blue next ply.
Reforge preference. Home →Sanctum; Apex only in already-broken positions.
Play. Convert exits into time. Post Reds to raise runner distance, clamp the penult lids with Oranges, and
only cash a Blue capture when the Reforge graph is already closed; otherwise decline the poison and keep
counting breaths.
“Count exits, not victims.” — Kargath, the Last Blade
Ecktorian School (Canray)
Doctrine. Symmetry, roads, and one decisive break. Lattice first, thrust once.
Typical lines. Twin “roads” of Red/Orange; Blue stabilizes flank then pivots; Central Four entered only
with certified exits (XS≥1) to impose a geometric lock.
Seed timing. Post-lock to convert initiative into material (extra Green).
Reforge preference. Home; Sanctum if it preserves parity; avoids Apex.
Play. Maintain mirrored “roads” as insurance, then select a single certified rupture and rebuild the lattice
behind it. Seed comes after the lock, converting tempo into a lasting material edge.
“Symmetry is mercy; the single break is law.” — Legate Varro Pellanus
Vhasian School (Canray)
Doctrine. Honor as bait; strike on the quiet file.
Typical lines. Blue “duel posture” toward the Central Four to draw coverage; opposite Sanctum Seed
blooms a Green sprint.
Seed timing. Early–mid, behind pageantry screens (SSI-neutral to safe).
Reforge preference. Sanctum for counter-duel lanes.
Play. Use Blue showmanship to pull screens; the quiet file carries the real lane. Opposite-Sanctum Seed
starts the sprint while the crowd watches the decoy.
21
“Polish the helm in public; sharpen the knife in private.” — Dame Ysoria, the Blood-Price
Viterran School (Canray)
Doctrine. Fences first; verdict later.
Typical lines. Homeward bridges and corridor welding; Central Four rarely used; Green runs a causeway
finished two turns earlier.
Seed timing. Midgame once the fence bites (XS low for opponent).
Pre-build root squares; collect Blue next ply.
Reforge preference. Home to reset the structure.
Play. Build fences first and hand down the verdict later. Corridor welds make the race unwinnable before
the run begins; Greens travel causeways finished two turns ago.
“Control the road, not the man.” — Lady Brigid, Gate-Minder
Aeler School (K’thra)
Doctrine. Toll every lane. Win by economics of motion.
Typical lines. Sideways-leaning Orange “toll stations”; force unprofitable routes; Blue Seeds as investment
when specials are spent (SSI-safe) and CCA favors you.
Seed timing. When SSI is favorable and cap pressure advantages you (CCA>0).
Reforge preference. Home (stability first).
Play. Turn movement into a ledger: sideways Oranges become toll posts, forcing reroute tax until profitable
paths disappear. Seed only when SSI and cap pressure pay interest.
“Tolls fund bridges, escorts, and floodgates; price lists are posted publicly and audited.” —
Factor–Green Emsdir
Vilikari School (Kanry)
Doctrine. Tempo theft and misdirection.
Typical lines. Off-beat Orange thrust; sudden Central Four raid only with XS≥1; rapid flank swap to steal
screens.
Seed timing. Opportunistic—off a feint that pulls screens away (creates SSI window).
Save one special. second-special lines must pass SRI.
Reforge preference. Sanctum for continued pressure; occasional Apex stab if density is low.
Play. Live on tempo spikes and flank swaps. Keep one Blue special banked; raid the Cross only with XS1,
then pivot to a Seed window you created two beats earlier.
“Sell them the moments you stole.” — Onne, Peddler-Queen
Thepyrgosi School (Orator’s)
Doctrine. Parity proofs and zugzwang.
Typical lines. Mirror lattices; Central Four used to force inevitabilities, not material grabs; late Seed to
clinch the proof.
Seed timing. Late, once every legal reply concedes tempo.
Reforge preference. Home; Sanctum only if it preserves a parity bind.
Play. Freeze parity and collect concessions. Delay Seed until every legal reply cedes a breath; the finish is an
inevitability, not a chase.
“Name the rule you cannot move; the rest is choice.” — Aqyl of Thepyrgos
22
Ubral School (Highland)
Doctrine. Edge weather; arrive unseen.
Typical lines. Feigned retreats; edge lattices that look porous; surprise Green appears four-exact from fog.
Central Four mostly ignored unless it opens an edge gate.
Seed timing. Off an edge pivot, not center play.
Reforge preference. Home; they plan for the second fight.
Play. Hide intent at the edges with feigned retreats and porous-looking lattices. The runner appears from
fog exactly four when the map has already shrunk.
“Walk with the fog; let your route arrive first.” — Laird Cormag
Silkstrand School (Bravo)
Doctrine. Dazzle to dictate; hop to harvest.
Typical lines. Telegraph a hop, then sidestep Blue to Sanctum; Central Four theatrics only with XS exits;
trap rebounds with stylish forks.
Seed timing. Early–mid off a flourish that baits screens away (manufactured SSI).
Save one special. second-special lines must pass SRI.
Reforge preference. Sanctum for tempo; Apex only when the crowd is “off-board” (local density low).
Play. Dazzle to dictate. Pull screens with flourish, then harvest with a single clean hop and a Seed pivot
while attention is elsewhere.
“Applause hides the blade; harvest on the quiet beat.” — Ava “Sable-Edge”
Black Banner Table (Mercenary Style)
Doctrine. Exploit the double-move; play the opponent, not the position.
Typical lines. Second-player double develops a Red lattice and an Orange probe; Central Four denied by
pre-built welds; precise SSI/XS tracking every turn.
Seed timing. Only when punish counters are exhausted or out-of-range.
Reforge preference. Sanctum for counterpressure when field is dispersed; Home in dense melee.
Notes. Reads as “pragmatic Kon’reh”; no showy Apex reforges.
“The Truth is admirable... but not profitable. Blood for gold.” — Captain Lathan Bloodgoode
Sergeant Rekedim Many-Scars’s Convoy (The Supply Sergeant’s Logistic Method)
Doctrine. Five-turn math first, tactics second.
Typical lines. Pre-weld banner lanes two turns ahead; never Central Four without XS; Seeds only when the
next Reforge line improves (shortens yours, lengthens theirs).
Reforge preference. Home unless a Sanctum placement shortens your opponent’s banner by ≥1 turn
(avoid it).
Table habit. Quiet count of opponent runner distances every turn.
Play. Five-turn math before contact. Pre-weld banner lanes and refuse Cross touches without certified exits;
each ply is a logistics check.
"Every ounce of gold is an ounce of grain... opportunity is always cost." — Rekedim Many-Scars
Detective Saikou Ira’s Fogbound (The Dockside Investigator’s Canon)
Doctrine. Obscure incentives; trade space for misreads.
Typical lines. Invite overreach into “empty” files; Central Four bait with pre-certified exits; delayed Seeds
that look late and land early.
23
Reforge preference. Sanctum to keep the misread alive.
Notes. Training overlay uses hidden target squares (coaching tool, not a rules change).
Play. Obscure incentives and sell empty files. Delay Seeds so they resolve early on the clock and make every
correction cost a reroute.
"The fog conceals threats horrible and mundane; in the dark, all dangers are the same." —
Detective Saikou Ira, esq.
Aelinnel Trade-Ledger (Guild Style)
Doctrine. Cap management and small margins.
Typical lines. Early side-tolls, gentle trades that tilt the Green cap clock; Central Four avoided unless it
buys two tempos.
Seed timing. To force cap parity on your terms (CCA control).
Reforge preference. Home (bookkeeping resilience).
Play. Win the book by a copper: side-tolls, gentle trades, and cap management. Avoid center unless it buys
two tempos and improves the next Reforge line.
"The Aeler dream they are the masters of coin... but we were doing differentials as they were
digging in the dirt." Guildmaster Kadennuck Relumbyg
Lethai School ("Single-Stroke, Quiet Road")
Doctrine. Win by inevitability, not attrition. Build the net; deny Seeds; manage the cap; then make one
decisive Blue capture only when the five clocks already force a failed Reforge.
Typical lines. Twin backward bridges; opposite-Sanctum occupation on Rooted tell; Cross used as a timer
(lower XS), not a hunting ground; poison-square offers that are EV-proven.
Seed timing. Only at SSI ≥2 (their Blue distant & specials spent). Aim Greens 2–1 without pushing cap
to 6 unless ahead.
Pre-build root squares; collect Blue next ply.
Reforge preference. Home (stability; no theatrics). The “stroke” happens before capture—on the graph.
Piece roles. Reds = breath-posts (penultimate welds); Oranges = lids (Sanctum clamps); Green = ledger
runner (rarely used offensively).
Table habit. Count exits, not threats. Save Blue specials until pruning runners; never trade them for tempo.
Counters. Parity schools that refuse bait and demand proof; genuine chaos (fast XS2 Cross raids) before
the lattice matures.
Notes. “Zero-capture” wins are a flex, not a plan—under tournament no-progress rules, cash the single
stroke when RC is dead.
Play. Refuse captures until the net is airtight. The stroke lands only when the Reforge is already impossible;
calendar first, blade last.
“The only clean stroke is the last.” — Sereth of the Valewood
On Provenance: The Dhaharan Claim
Aqyl of Thepyrgos, marginal note6: “Dhahara keeps the oldest boards I have handled
without priestly intercession: lacquered teak from caravanserai vaults, scored for a 9 ×9 diamond
with a literal cross incised at center. Local usage names an ancestor Kanr¯ay—“the road’s
count.” Of its several customs, two appear to persist in our Kon’reh: what host-law calls the
“guest’s double courtesy” (the second player’s opening double-move), and the paired “wells”
6Aqyl concedes Dhaharan influence while maintaining the Thepyric “perfection” thesis; his habit is to qualify
where others proclaim.
24
at the side-apex—our Twin Apex Seed—often marked, where marks survive (and if not later
restorations), by water glyphs.
Whether influence ran Dhahara →steppe, steppe →Dhahara, or (as seems likeliest) both by
turns, is not demonstrable from the present record. Fhara way-stations along the Way of Silk
confound trajectories; Kuvani polities fought and traded with Ykrul and Dhaharans north of the
Himdahl’s; scribes copied boards as they copied tariffs. We must not overstate. The Ykrul will
say they made the thing a war-art; Ecktorian legates will square it into lattice and law.
On the name. It is sometimes urged (cautiously) that Kanr¯ay and Kon’reh mean much the
same thing. The lexica permit it: Dhaharan kan- (road/way) with -r¯ay (reckoning), and the
steppe kon- (route) with -reh (tally), the apostrophe a later scribal habit. One may call this a
cognate pair, or a calque, or merely convergent shop-talk among caravans and camps. If it proves
anything, it proves only that players everywhere have counted roads and called that counting a
game. I am prepared to write no more than that.”

Aqyl of Thepyrgos, affecting balance, writes: “Kon’reh’s paternity is a crowded tent. The Ykrul
monsters parade their scorched steppe sets and firelight maxims; awkward artifacts for later
claimants, yes, but artifacts nonetheless. The Aeler, with a straight face, insist they ‘invented’
the game in their stone halls. And—well—despite whatever ‘evidence’ the Ykrul wave about, it
is plain the Empire in Ecktoria refined it, and we Thepyrgosi perfected it. If you prefer a neutral
crest: the steppe lit the spark, Ecktoria set it in stone, Silkstrand sold tickets, and the orators
taught it to argue with itself. Today the same diamond sits in a Longblood keep, a Viterran
river tavern, an Aeler under-vault, and a Silk strand salon; provenance matters less than who
can read the thesis.”

Boardside Proverbs
• Enter the Cross only with an exit; leave a Sanctum only with a reason.
• ZoC is the blade that cuts on your opponent’s turn.
• A Green is worth one lie and three truths.
• Count exits before captures. Count banners before exits.
• Seed punishes forgetfulness, not bravery.
• Two quiet Reds win louder than one brilliant Blue.
• If a move looks forced, ask who forced it.
• Cap at six is not a number; it’s a clock.
• The best hop is the one you never had to threaten.
• Apex is a promise. Sanctum is a plan. Home is a ledger.
Study tip: Pick one school’s doctrine and drill its two or three hallmark patterns (opening, Seed window,
banner denial). Then scrimmage against a contrasting school to reveal blind spots.
On Schools & Mastery
Aqyl of Thepyrgos, marginalia to the Canré corpus:
“Kon’reh does not reward the indecisive. The board recognizes convictions. A Ykrul who fences
exits as if they were laws; a Vilikari who haggles tempo as if it were coin; a Thepyrgosi who
refuses every asymmetry until the proof writes itself—these win because they do not betray their
grammar when the wind turns.
The match is often decided before the first stone moves: style into counter-style, like weather
over a road. The art is not to become your predator; it is to out-argue them in your own tongue.
Control must learn where parity breaks from within control. Tempo must learn to burst through
a net without ceasing to be tempo. This is mastery: not many blades, but one blade honed so
keenly it parries its natural bane.”
Practical Consequences
• Identity before improvisation. Pick a school; drill its three hallmark patterns (opening shape, Seed
window, banner denial) until they are reflexes.
• Prep the hard counter. Build a within-school anti-line versus your predator (e.g., Ykrul prep vs.
Thepyrgosi is a lattice that manufactures an asymmetry without conceding exits).
27
• Discipline heuristics. Live by SSI/XS/CCA; they are style-agnostic tests that keep you from
“becoming someone else” under pressure.
Coach’s Notes — One Minute Before Play
School read What’s their school? What’s your anti-line in your grammar?
Seed windows First Seed window where SSI ≥2 if you get it? First Rooted punish if they get it?
Free Blue test If a “free Blue” appears, can you plant under ZoC in ≤4? If no, it’s poison.

13 Choose Your First Plan
Pick a plan that fits your instincts. These are playstyles, not rules.
Legend: [CF: in a/3]=Blue’sturnsinCross(max3); [RC n/5]=Reforgecounter; XS=exitcertifications;
SSI = Seed Safety Interval; S:H = Hop; S:D = Displacement.
Vhasian Showmanship; tempo trades
First plan
1. Touch Cross to signal a duel—enter with exits.
2. Twin Apex Seed on the opposite Sanctum; start a
quiet Green lane.
3. Reserve one special for the finishing tactic.
Keys
• CF: Presence = bait; never enter without XS ≥1.
• Seed: Early–mid; SSI ≥1.
• Specials: Spend one; avoid Stagger traps.
Pitfall Overcommitting to Cross; spending both spe-
cials early.
Ykrul Timers; denial; pragmatic trades
First plan
1. Track [CF: in a/3] and enforce the 2-turn exclu-
sion.
2. Clamp a Sanctum lane; delay a safe Seed.
3. Trade toward a failed Reforge ([RC n/5] trending
down).
Keys
• CF: Enter only with XS ≥1.
• Seed: Screen first; respect the Green cap.
• Specials: Low spend; win on the Reforge clock.
Pitfall Chasing captures over banner math.
Thepyrgosi Clean geometry; safe equity
First plan
1. Post Reds; certify exits (XS).
2. Seed only when Rooted is fully screened.
3. Use Hop as a theorem step, not a brawl.
Keys
• CF: Proof of exits > presence.
• Seed: Respect Mobilization; opposite Sanctum
clear.
• Specials: One per life unless forced.
Pitfall Pretty lines that lose tempo; Cross camping.
Viterran Iron-choke logistics; weld and starve
First plan
1. Post Reds to gate exits; threaten a two-ply Lane
Weld (Red cut + Orange fork).
2. Touch Cross only when XS ≥1; force them to burn
[CF: in a/3] on defense.
3. Converttheclampintobannermath—tradetoward
a failed Reforge ([RC n/5] trending down).
Keys
• CF: Deny re-entry routes; make their Cross turns
unprofitable.
• Seed: Screen first; prefer Seeds that deepen the
choke (respect Green cap and Mobilization).
• Specials: Save S:D to finish the weld; keep S:H
for parity escapes.
Pitfall Building pretty walls that reopen exits; ignor-
ing the Reforge clock; early Seeds without cover.
Quick tells.
• Vhasian: Screens follow your Blue; a quiet file advances behind pressure.
• Ykrul: You’re ahead on [CF] timing or [RC n/5]; their banner route is clogged.
• Thepyrgosi: Exits certified (XS ≥1); specials unspent at decision points.
• Viterran: Two exits gated; live Lane Weld threat; [RC n/5] dropping while their [CF] entries lose tempo.

A Official Player Aid
Terminology: Onward = along the Home→Opposing axis (exact steps). Homeward = along the perpendicular axis
toward either Sanctum (up-to steps).
Movement & ZoC
• Red: Onward = 2 (exact); Homeward up to
1.
• Orange: Onward = 3 (exact); Homeward up
to 2.
• Green: Onward = 4 (exact); Homeward up
to 3.
• Blue: Onward = 5 (exact); Homeward up to
4.
• ZoC: you may enter enemy ZoC; you may not
pass through. Entering ZoC ends the move.
• Capture (R/O/G): displacement only.
Blue Specials (per Blue life)
• Displacement: move 1 step in a straight line
onto an adjacent enemy; remove it. Once.
• Hop-capture: jump over 1 adjacent enemy
in a straight line to the empty square beyond;
remove the jumped enemy. Once.
• At most one special per Blue turn. Blue
cannot hop without capturing.
• Blue may slide, then use one special if adja-
cency permits.
• Crown Stagger (core): after the second spe-
cial this life, Blue is Rooted until your next
turn.
Twin Apex Seed
• After Blue ends on a Sanctum, you may spawn
1 Green on the opposite Sanctum (empty;
global Green cap 6).
• That Blue becomes Rooted until your next
turn begins.
• Mobilization delay: you may not Seed on
the Blue’s first departure from Home Apex.
Worked Example — Mobilization Delay af-
ter Sanctum Reforge
A Blue that returns to a Sanctum via Reforge
may Seed on its very next turn, because Mobi-
lization delay gates the first departure from
Home, not “first time on Sanctum.”
Timeline. (i) Blue is captured. (ii) Runner
plants; Blue returns on a Sanctum. (iii) On its
next turn, Blue may Seed (Rooted afterward)
if all normal Seed conditions are met. (iv)
Much later, when that Blue eventually leaves
Home for the first time in this life (after later
returns), it still “owes” Mobilization delay for
that departure.
Mobilization delay keys off leaving Home (not
merely being on a Sanctum). See the worked
example in the Player Aid, “Mobilization Delay
after Sanctum Reforge.”
Central Four (the Cross)
• The Cross is the central 2×2 diamond.
• May occupy up to 3 consecutive turns; then
must end outside the Cross.
• After leaving: 2-turn exclusion (your turns)
before re-entry.
Reforge (after Blue capture)
• You have 5 of your turns to plant a banner
(end a move on enemy Home Apex with any
piece).
• On success, remove the runner; place your Blue
on:
– Opposing Apex — sacrifice a Green you
control (runner Green may pay).
– Either Sanctum — that Blue may never
Seed from that same Sanctum.
30
– Your Home Apex — no cost.
• Reforged Blue returns with both specials re-
freshed.
Heuristics
SSI — Seed Safety Index
• 0: enemy Blue has ≥1 special and can reach

B Edge-Case Clarifications
Mobilization scope (edge case). If a reforged Blue is placed on a Sanctum, it still may not
Seed on its first departure from its Home Apex for that life; the delay keying event is “leaves Home,”
not “spawns on/visits Sanctum.”
Blue hop vs. ZoC. When hop-capturing, Blue may start in, pass over, and land in enemy ZoC;
ZoC on the jumped square is ignored. The landing square must be empty (it may be in ZoC), and
the move ends there. Combination: Blue may slide, then use one special (hop or displacement)
in the same turn if adjacency permits; it may not use both specials in one turn. Blue cannot hop
without capturing.
No special→slide. If Blue uses a special (Hop or Displacement), its turn ends immediately after
resolving that special—even if its slide distance would otherwise remain available.
Seed timing & Rooted. Seed triggers after Blue’s move fully resolves, and only if Blue ended
on a Sanctum. Apply Mobilization delay (no Seed on Blue’s first move that leaves Home). After
seeding, mark that Blue Rooted until your next turn begins (it still exerts ZoC and can be captured
while Rooted).
Cross timer & exclusion. Each time your turn ends with Blue on any Cross square, increment
that Blue’s Cross counter. If your next turn would end a fourth time in the Cross, you must play
a move that ends outside the Cross this turn. After Blue ends outside the Cross, begin a 2-turn
exclusion (your next two turns) during which that Blue cannot re-enter the Cross. Turn vs. move:
On the second player’s opening double-move, both moves occur within one turn. If Blue is in the
Cross at the end of that double-move, increment the counter by 1 (not 2).
Opening double-move (second player). You may not move the same piece twice. Cross
counting follows the turn-based rule above. Reforge countdown is always 5 of the captured player’s
turns.
Reforge runner specifics. Plant occurs when a runner ends on the enemy Home Apex; ZoC
does not prevent planting. If the runner is captured before ending on the Apex, no plant occurs.
On a successful plant, remove the runner, immediately place your Blue per the Reforge options,
then play passes to the opponent (normal alternation).
Greens at cap. If seeding would exceed the global cap (6), the Seed is illegal. Sacrificing a Green
for Opposing-Apex placement reduces the on-board count and may reopen cap space for future
Seeds.

C Notation and Logging
“In my recent dealings with the Aeler, I was taken aside by a rather ambitious Edgewalker. He
knew of my admiration for Canray and wished to show me a most curious artifact: a machine of
Aelinnel make, the K’thra Tabulator. A bronze pillar with a Canray board atop it; arrayed with
marble pieces carved in the Aeler style. It was fed a scroll of queer marks and strange characters,
numbers and letters in odd array. After quite the tumultuous noise, I was shocked to see the
marble pieces move of their own accord. However, delighted as I was, the tabulator proved a poor
opponent. Fascinating mechanism; poor theory.”
Duke Braedon Fenwood (in the old hand: B.V. Velvano III), Tarlington, Kindling Year 856 A.R.
(o,h) Coordinates — Minimal Reference
We index lanes as an ordered pair (o,h): onward axis o, homeward axis h. Choose the player’s Home
Apex as (0,0). A step on[R] increases o; on[L] decreases o. A step hm[R] increases h; hm[L] decreases
h.
Example. From (0,0), On[R]3 →(3,0). From (5,1), Hm[L]2 →(3,1) if path is clear and no hostile
ZoC is crossed.
Pieces and abbreviations
Glyph Piece Notes
B Blue (royal) Has two specials per life: Displacement and Hop-capture.
O Orange (officer) Long-lane mover, sets forks and lids.
R Red (line) Short anchor, builds bridges and welds.
G Green (raider) Spawns via Seed, typically a runner.

Notes.
• The example showcases (i) Cross residency tracking on a Blue turn, (ii) a Blue slide→Hop
special, and (iii) the Reforge countdown decreasing on the defender’s subsequent turns.
• Use of [RC k/5] always refers to planting on the enemy Home Apex.
D Tournament Options (Optional)
D.1 Draw & Adjudication Rules
50–Turn No-Progress Rule. A progress event is either (i) any capture (of any color) or (ii) a
successful Seed (a Green is actually placed). If 50 full turns elapse without a progress event, the
game is eligible to be declared a draw.
• Full turn. One move by each player (A then B) is one full turn. Track with a shared counter
that resets to 0 upon any progress event.
• Claim procedure. On your own turn before you move: pause clocks, announce “50–turn
no-progress,” and call the director. If verified, the game is a draw; if not, restore clocks and
continue.
• Director adjudication. Events may use automatic draws at 50, or “claim required.” The
default here is claim required.
Threefold Repetition. A player may claim a draw when the same position has occurred
three times with the same player to move. “Same position” means board state and all relevant
trackers are identical:
• Piece locations and side to move.
• Each Blue’s Rooted status.
• Central Four stay counters (0–3) and exclusion counters (0–2) for each Blue.
• Each Blue’s specials-used flags (Hop available? Displacement available?).
• Each Blue’s Mobilization owed flag (whether it still cannot Seed on its first departure from
Home in this life).
• Reforge countdown (value 1–5 or none) and which side is under countdown.
• Sanctum restriction flags (if a Blue reforged onto a Sanctum, that Blue’s “no future Seed
from this same Sanctum” must match).
• Global Green count on board (cap state); individual Green counts by side.
• If the optional Crown Buyback rule is ON: each Blue’s once-per-life buyback availability must
also match.
35
Claim procedure. On your turn before you move: pause clocks, announce “threefold repetition,”
identify the three occurrences (move numbers or log entries), and call the director. If verified, the
game is a draw; if not, restore clocks and continue.
D.2 Illegal Move Remedies
Illegal Cross End (fourth consecutive stay). Blue on any Central Four square is illegal.
Ending a fourth consecutive turn with your
• Remedy (immediate). Rewind to the start of the offending turn and require a legal exit that
turn. The offender must make a legal move; no other moves may be substituted from that turn.
• Remedy (discovered late). If detected later in the game, rewind to the start of the offending
turn (restore clocks as directed) and require a legal exit move for that turn; resume from there.
• Penalties. First offense: warning. Subsequent offenses: director may apply time or score
penalties.
B.2 Slide→Special and ZoC. Reminder for arbiters and players: “slide then special” is
legal unless the slide entered enemy ZoC, because entering ZoC ends the move. Slide-into-
ZoC→special is illegal; apply standard illegal-move remedies.
D.3 Tracking Aids (Recommended)
• Two small markers beside each Blue to show specials remaining (H, D).
• One die per captured Blue to show the Reforge countdown (5→1).
• One shared dial/track for the global Green cap (0–6).
• Optional per-Blue flags for Mobilization owedand Sanctum restriction, to simplify threefold
claims.
D.4 Optional Knobs
Crown Buyback (Optional)
On your turn, if your Blue is on your Home Apex, you may forgo moving to refresh one spent
Blue special (Hop or Displacement) by sacrificing one Green you control. Limit: once
per Blue life. This consumes your turn (no movement, capture, or Seed). Sacrificing a Green
reduces the on-board count and may reopen global cap space. Tournament directors must
announce Buyback status (ON/OFF) before play.
Pie Rule (Tournament Variant)
1. Seat as usual: Player A (moves first), Player B (owns the opening double-move).
2. Provisional opener. Player A plays one move.
3. Swap decision. Player B must either:
• Hold: Keep sides; proceed with B’s normal double-move (two different pieces), or
36
• Swap: Switch sides immediately; the original A becomes the new B and now takes
the double-move this turn.
4. All other rules unchanged (Mobilization delay, Cross timers, etc.). The double-move
always belongs to whoever is second to move after the swap decision.
D.5 Director Guidance (Practical)
• Logging. Require a consistent move log with state tags where relevant (e.g., [Rooted], [CF:in 1/3],
[S:H], [RC 3/5]). This accelerates threefold/no-progress verification.
• Claims protocol. Players must pause clocks before claims; false claims restore clocks and may
incur a small time penalty at the director’s discretion.
• No-progress vs. forced lines. Directors may decline a 50–turn draw if a forced win exists on
the board and the claimant demonstrably avoided progress; otherwise, draw by rule.
D.6 Default Time Controls and Start-Balance
Core rule. Unless players mutually agree otherwise (or an event specifies different settings),
ranked/tournament Kon’r¯eh uses a 10+5 Fischer time control (10 minutes base with +5 seconds
increment per move) and the P2 double-move start-balance. Casual or learning games may disregard
this default.

E The Five-Breath Weave
War-Sage Khel of the River Steppe7:
“You wish to learn the Weave of Five? Then stop counting pieces—start counting breaths8
.
The board has five that matter.”11.1
• Cross Stay — three breaths a Blue may squat in the center (max three of its own turns).
• Cross Exile — two breaths it must keep away once it flees (two of its own turns).
• Seed Rooting — one breath your Blue is nailed when it spawns a Green (until your next
turn).
• Blue’s Edges — two cuts only; when both are spent, the royal is nailed for a breath.
• Reforge March — five of the foe’s turns to plant a banner or drown.
Bind these clocks and you do not trap his Blue, you trap his calendar. The stones are only the
knots you tie in time. We cast it in five breaths thus:
1. First Breath (Throat). Lay a Red homeward 1 to shape a throat toward center; its
ZoC is not a wall but a funnel.
2. Second Breath (Hinge). Slide an Orange homeward (up to 2) to hinge the throat; show
a false seam where his Blue believes it can breathe.
3. Third Breath (Hook). When he rushes the Cross, lean in—make him spend a cut
(special) to swat your Orange. The Cross Stay is already bleeding.
4. Fourth Breath (Lid). While his Cross Exile ticks, nail a Red beside his likeliest Sanctum;
this is the lid that makes Seed unsafe.
5. Fifth Breath (Net). Only now do you place the net—either Seed from your safe Sanctum
(for the rooted one-breath) because his cuts are gone, or stride a Green onward through the
seam you advertised on the Second Breath. In both, his Reforge March will run through
your throat.
If he hoards both cuts, the Weave reverses: do not Seed—make him choose between Cross
suffocation and Sanctum famine, then crown with Green where his ledger is short by one breath.
If he spends both cuts early, you Seed for free and let the clock do the murder.
Remember: the ignorant play for squares. The proud play for pieces. We play for breaths. Count
them aloud in your skull and you will feel when the knot tightens. When he finally sees it, do
nothing clever—just close the lid.”
Translator’s scholium. The Sage calls all timing windows “breaths.” I render them as “clocks” for
clarity. Where he occasionally says “stone,” he means the piece committed to that breath. Typically
these are Reds (first, fourth) and an Orange (second), but any piece may be the “stone” that fixes a
knot in time. The essence of the Weave is synchronizing (i) Cross timers, (ii) Blue-special depletion,
and (iii) Seed rooting, so that a Blue capture yields a manufactured five-turn Reforge into a prepared
ZoC funnel.
7Recorded and translated by Aqyl of Thepyrgos; circulation of this transcript was later proscribed.
8Aqyl of Thepyrgos originally rendered “breaths” as “clocks” to match the Thepyric understanding..

M7: A: Blue hmR 4 to a Sanctum (no Seed).
tures B’s forward Red (save Displacement).
Mobilized; holds both specials.
[G:2–1]
M8: B: Blue to right Sanctum →Seed to left
Sanctum. [Rooted] Rooted for one ply.
M20: B: Blue hmR 1 to contact; holds both spe-
cials. Probe the center exchange.
M9: A: Declines recapture; Orange hmL 2 to
cover the opposite Sanctum lane. Don’t cash
now—close futures.
M21: A: Blue slides onto the central “poison”
square, adjacent to B’s Blue; A has H used,
D kept. Invite the trade on our terms.
M10: B: (Blue rooted) Green onR 3 to a center
junction (lane post). Hold while [Rooted] burns.
M22: B: Displacement-captures A’s adjacent
Blue. [S:D] RC 1/5 starts for A. Now
race the banner.
M11: A: Screen: Red onL 2 vs. Green lanes.
M12: B:Blue un-rooted; drifts hmR 3toward cen-

M23: A (RC 1/5): Red onL 2 to killbox B’s
stopper line (interdict penultimate). Clear
lanes to Opposing.

M24: B: Orange onR 3 (fresh stopper). Deny the
sprint squares.
M25: A (RC 2/5): Green onR 3 to fork lanes
(force the re-route).
M26: B: Red hmL 2 to meet the fork; burns a ply
inside ZoC. Time over territory.
M27: A (RC 3/5): Orange hmR 3 (lane A

M28: B: Orange hmR 2 to plug; still two steps
short of a full block. Angles are thin.
M29: A (RC 4/5): Red onL 2 trades out the
plug (capture), re-opening the file. [G:3–1]

Displacement trap. Respect A’s unused spe-
cial.

Blue in via Sanctum; Displacement picks
off B’s exposed Blue next ply ⇒RC 1/5
for B. [S:D] Five-Breaths flip: CF control, RoC
tick, Specials parity, CapC lead, RC pressure.

Why the Weave Works. A never “cashes” early value. Instead, A (i) denies future Seeds, (ii)
engineers [G:] superiority, (iii) spends [S:] only to prune runners, and (iv) offers a poison Blue-capture
that converts immediately into a lost [RC] race. B’s tempo raids are excellent, but once [G:] reaches
2–0 and the penultimate banner squares are ZoC end-squares, every path is a step short.
Coach’s Notes — Both Schools
Seed discipline Seed only when SSI ≥2 (their Blue distant & specials spent or screened). If SSI < 2,
you’re donating tempo.
“Free” Blue test Never take a “free” Blue unless the five-turn banner graph is solved; if you cannot plant
in ≤4 under ZoC, the capture is a noose.
Blue specials Track cuts: Hop/Displacement. 1 cut left = threaten; 0 cuts = clamp & Seed. Don’t spend
both cuts before your safe Seed.
Cross math Plan exit before entry. Enter only if you can leave cleanly next turn or force value. [CF:in 1/3]
means two of your turns remain; [CF:ex 1/2] bars you for two of your turns.
Ring over Cross Non-Blues stay out of the Cross. Use Reds/Oranges to ring and funnel; Blue touches
center briefly as a lever, not a home.
Rooted punish When [Rooted] shows, post lids (penultimate squares near Sanctums) and print lanes. Force
them to defend while Blue is immobile for a breath.
Penultimate squares End the race here. If you control the squares one step before either Sanctum, runners
die on time. Prefer a sturdy post over a flashy capture.
Reforge denial After a Blue falls, [RC] ticks on the captor’s turns. Deny with: (i) penultimate lids, (ii) reroute
taxes (burn a ply inside ZoC), (iii) trading sprinters for time.
Poison capture If offered their Blue, ask: “Do I have a planted line in ≤4 under ZoC?” If not, decline or
take only with an immediate lid net in place.
Green usage Green runs lanes, not fights. Screen your Green with Reds; avoid exposing it to Blue specials.
Use Seed to split attention, then walk the quieter lane.
Mirror rule If you’re worse on cuts or timers, mirror anchors then improve one file. Don’t race a faster
clock; make them waste a breath first.
Tempo trades Trade only when it buys time: a capture that opens their lane is bad; a trade that seals a
penultimate square is good.
41
SSI quick read: +1 if [CF:ex 1/2] or their Blue far; +1 if their cuts spent; +1 if your lids posted. Seed at SSI ≥2.

F Speed Canray (Blitz)
They say Speed Canray wasn’t born in a Silkstrand salon, but in steppe camps after sundown.
Ykrul youths... wrists braided in wagers... cut the clocks to the length of a watch-smoke, flipped
the board between patrols, and bet on who could plant first without getting their Blue butchered.
We Black Banners picked it up because it drills what keeps you breathing: first read, clean exit,
honest count. These days the river houses dress it up with swap rules (the PIE rule) and wax
tablets to keep score, but the soul’s the same. I’ve seen small fortunes won on a three-breath
sprint and grudges born that outlasted empires. If you’re asking whether a takeback after the
clock press is wise... keep your teeth.
—Captain Lathan “No-Colors” Bloodgoode, Crimson Quittance
Speed Canray (Blitz Variant)
Intent. Faster rounds without touching core rules.
Time controls. Recommended 5+3. Alternatives: 3+2 (sharper), 5+0 (arena).
Start balance. Organizer chooses one: Pie rule(recommended for bases ≤4 min) or P2 double-move
(standard feel).
Crown Buyback. Off for Speed events.
Reforge. Unchanged (5 of the captured side’s turns).
No-progress draw. In Speed, call a draw after 30 consecutive turns (15 each) with no progress
event. Progress events are: any capture; a Seed; a Blue enter or exit of the Central Four; a banner plant.
Illegal move handling. Rewind to last legal position; add +30s to the opponent’s clock; resume with
the offender to move.
Takeback (club option). Each player may request at most one takeback per match. Conditions:
• Request must be made immediately after releasing the piece and before pressing the clock.
• Opponent has not yet moved, pressed their clock, or claimed any result.
• Position is restored; clocks unchanged. The requesting player then makes a legal move (not
required to move the same piece).
Recommended: not used in playoffs/rated events. Record usage on the scoresheet.
Scorekeeping. Notation optional. If disputes arise, clocks + board state govern.
Lightning Canray (Bullet)
Time controls. 2+1 (default) or 3+0.
Teaching toggle (pick one, optional).
• Basic–CF: Ignore Cross exclusion (no 2-turn re-entry ban). 3-stay cap still applies.
• Basic–Mobilization: Ignore Mobilization delay (Blue may Seed on its first departure).
Do not use both. Record the toggle on the scoresheet.
No-progress draw. 20 consecutive turns (10 each) with no progress event (same definition as Blitz).
Crown Buyback. Off.
Takeback (club option). Same as Blitz: one per player, only if requested before clock press and before
any reply; restore position; clocks unchanged.
43
Speed Canray — Meta Note
This variant intentionally skews slightly toward Tempo/Edge schools (faster initiative, pre-baked
exits). Organizers: keep the skew fun (not lopsided) with soft knobs:
• Clock: baseline 3+2. For Lightning, 2+0 (expect stronger Tempo tilt).
• Pie rule: Recommended. Apply after P2’s double to damp opening spikes.
• Opening pack (optional): Publish 2–3 “book” starts per school so Control/Parity lines
aren’t cold on move 1.
• Buyback: Keep Crown Buyback OFF for Speed to avoid grind loops.
Players: embrace the tilt—Tempo presses, Control proves. Treat XS/SSI as hard gates: enter
CF only at XS ≥2; seed at SSI ≥1 (prefer 2).

Postscript: A Tournament Amongst Ash — The Testimony of
Legate Varro Pellanus
Provenance: Single vellum leaf, torn from a sewn journal; margins scored with ruling awl, lower-right
corner stained with what appears to be an arterial handprint. Found interleaved in an Ecktorian technical
codex, On Aqueduct Maintenance, Book IV (anonymous clerk’s copy), during cataloging of the Tarlington
Waterworks Collection. Shelfmark: TPL–WW/IV–441. Interleaf shows press-gloss from the codex’s
copper diagrams; ink hand consistent with a field log.
223 A.R. Thirty-two days after the third defiling9 of our great city. The Ykrul general, one
Taraksa Ghez, who has declared herself “Magistrate of Ecktoria,” has announced the “orderly
withdrawal” of our “orcish” overlords10. I suspect she has word of our legions mustering on
the marches, ready to liberate Ecktoria. Yet she occupies herself with a peculiar business: the
reclamation of their holy game. I have heard the savages’ claim upon the Imperial Game since
boyhood and dismissed it as feverish. Now, within a moonrise, she has gathered those who might
pass as “masters.”
Among us: a pampered Vhasian, a scruffy Vilikari trader, a verminous [sic] bravo out of
Silkstrand11, and a preening Viterran ambassador. Among them: to my surprise, a stout “Aeler”
merchant-captain, beard bound with copper assay-rings, with his curious little “Aelinnel” aide
... apparently even a man from the gnomish gemcutters’ guild was corralled with us ... and,
most striking, a Lethai surgeon: a creature of beauty and menace who would give no reason for
coming beyond demonstrating his “mastery of lesser mortal occupations” (so my translators
swear; they look as bewildered as I). I believe Taraksa’s knife at his throat showed him he is as
mortal as I.
At first light, we were gathered from our billets by her riders. Elegant Canray tables were set ...
defiled by her “orcish” stones, as the Vhasian calls them. Ghez struck her tally-stick thrice on
the slate and said, “Play.” I have heard fewer than a hundred words from Taraksa in a moon,
each a command. Amongst the silk, dust, and ash of our city, we played. I would sooner lose my
Charter (my Blue) than my head, after all.
On This Corpus
I allow myself one satisfaction. The vellum leaf printed above is one of my most prized artifacts.
Those who have hunted the Legate’s account will recognize the script; may they burn with envy.
I collated it with road ledgers and Black Banner journals; it sits here where it ought. Others
searched. I found it.
The balance of this Corpus Canré Scholiatum stands on better feet than rumor. Names are
restored, glosses corrected, and the Tulughma Host set in its proper right. If there is error, it is
by the will of the gods, not mine own. The book is done.
Duke Braedon Fenwood (in the old hand: B. V. Velvano III), Tarlington, Ashing Year 862 A.R.
9Translator’s note: “defiling” is the Legate’s term. This was the third of four sackings of the capital during the
imperial wars with the Ykrul.
10Translator’s note: “Orc” is a Vhasian exonym and slur for the Ykrul, likely from Vhasian orca (“monster”). The
term appears here via imperial borrowing; its use is the Legate’s, not the translator’s. It is retained for historical
accuracy.
11Translator’s note: Silkstrand was still Çeyonne at this time.

Glossary
Apex: Any corner square: Home Apex, Opposing Apex, or either Sanctum.
Backward Bridge: A retreating Red pair that creates a corridor block for future banner lanes;
often used to deny late Reforge paths.
Banner / Plant: Ending any of your pieces’ move on the enemy Home Apex to enable Reforge.
The runner is removed after planting. See §6.
Basic–CF: Teaching toggle that ignores the Cross re-entry ban (exclusion) while keeping the 3-stay
cap. See §11.1.
Basic–Mobilization: Teaching toggle that ignores Mobilization delay (Blue may Seed on its first
departure). See §11.1.
Blue Specials: The Blue may use exactly one special per Blue turn: Displacement (step onto an
adjacent enemy to remove it) or Hop-capture (jump over one adjacent enemy to the empty square
beyond, removing it). Using both in the same life causes Crown Stagger. See §3.1.
CCA (Cap Clock Advantage): Heuristic: (your Greens theirs) plus a half-point if you can hit
the cap first. See player aid in §A.
Crown Buyback (optional): Tournament/variant knob: once per Blue life, spend one of your
Greens to clear Crown Stagger and immediately unroot your Blue (consumes the turn). See §12 or
organizer options in §D.
Crown Stagger: If a Blue spends its second special in the same life, it becomes Rooted until the
owner’s next turn. See §3.1.
Cross (Central Four): The central 2×2 diamond. A Blue may end at most 3 consecutive of its
turns here; on the next it must end outside. After leaving, it cannot re-enter for 2 of its owner’s
turns (exclusion). See §5.
Cross Exclusion: The 2-turn re-entry ban that applies after a Blue leaves the Cross. See §5.
Cross Stay: The timer that limits a Blue to 3 consecutive end-of-turns in the Cross. See §5.
Cross-Bridge: A corridor formed by parallel Reds that spans the Cross laterally, sealing exits
across its width.
46
Displacement: Blue special: move one step along the current lane onto an adjacent enemy piece;
remove it. See §3.1.
Double-move (P2): At the start of the game, the second player takes two moves on their first
turn. See turn order in §2.
Fork: A placement (often Orange) that produces two simultaneous threats or seals two exits on the
following ply.
Global Green Cap: At most 6 Greens may exist on the board in total for both players. Seeding
is unavailable while the cap is full. See §4.
Green (runner): A fast unit that is created by Seed; frequently used as the preferred Reforge
runner. See §4 and §6.
Homeward / Onward: Movement lanes relative to each Blue’s Home Apex. Onward moves
advance toward the opponent; Homeward moves retreat toward your Home. See movement in §3.
Hop-capture: Blue special: jump over one adjacent enemy along a lane to the immediately empty
square beyond, removing the hopped piece. The landing square must be vacant. See §3.1.
Lane Weld: Two-ply sequence (Red cut to the penultimate followed by an Orange fork ahead)
that seals all certified exits along a banner lane.
Lid: A controlling post (typically Orange) that clamps a file or Sanctum approach, denying exits or
a Seed follow-up.
Micro-Kon’reh: Intro mode on a 6×6 diamond with reduced rules (no Seed; short Reforge); used
to teach movement, ZoC, and clocks. See §11.1.
Mobilization Delay: You may not Seed on the Blue’s first departure from Home in a given life.
A Blue that returns via Reforge to a Sanctum may Seed on its next turn because it has not yet
departed Home in that life. See §4 and the example in §8.
Overlay: Overlapping ZoCs that layer to make a nominal exit permanently unsafe.
Penultimate (square): The square immediately before the enemy Home Apex along a banner
lane; critical weld square in Reforge defense.
Pie Rule (Swap): Opening balance option: after the first move, the second player may swap sides
instead of moving. See §D.
47
Pivot (Sanctum pivot): A Blue exit from the Cross that immediately changes fronts by stepping
to a Sanctum and/or Seeding. See §4.
Reforge: When your Blue is captured, you have 5 of your turns to plant a banner. On success,
remove the runner and place your Blue at Opposing Apex (cost: sacrifice a Green you control),
either Sanctum (cost: that Blue may never Seed from that same Sanctum), or your Home Apex (no
cost). Specials refresh. See §6.
Rooted: A Blue that cannot move until its owner’s next turn begins (usually after Seed or Crown
Stagger). See §3.1 and §4.
Sanctum: A side Apex from which a Blue may trigger Twin Apex Seed. See §4.
Seed (Twin Apex Seed): If your Blue ends on a Sanctum, and the opposite Sanctum is empty,
and the global cap allows, spawn a Green on the opposite Sanctum. The Blue becomes Rooted.
Not allowed on that Blue’s first departure from Home (Mobilization Delay). See §4.
Speed Canray: Optional fast variant emphasizing rapid reads and exits; see §12.
SSI (Seed Safety Index): A heuristic measuring whether a Seed is safe this turn given enemy
Blue range and specials. See player aid in §A.
State Tags: Bracketed monospace badges used in notation: [CF:in x/3] (Cross stay), [CF:ex
x/2] (Cross exclusion), [Rooted], [RC 3/5] (Reforge countdown), [G:a–b] (Greens on board). See
notation in §C.
Stay / Exclusion Timers: The Cross stay cap (3 consecutive ends-in-Cross) and the 2-turn
exclusion after exit. See §5.
Swap Rule: See Pie Rule.
Tutor Kon’reh: Full board with Seed disabled; restores Cross while reducing cognitive load during
teaching. See §11.1.
Twin Apex Seed: See Seed.
XS (Exit Certainty): Count of exits that cannot be ZoC-sealed within the next two opponent
plies (esp. for Cross entries/raids). See player aid in §A.
48
ZoC (Zone of Control): The four edge-adjacent squares around each piece; you may enter enemy
ZoC, but you may not pass through. Entering ZoC ends the move. See §3.

1 From the Diw¯ an of Roads and Boards: Collected Writings on
an Ancient Game— Safiya al–Fhara
They call the long road many names. In the north wind it is Kon’reh; in the delta tongue, a
market slang; among the Kuvani it is reshima kah mharga—the Way of Silk—where bells and
hooves make a single script upon the dust. I am Fhara, daughter of inns and ink, and I have
kept more ledgers than winters: way–house tallies, oaths poured over cairns, and a little book of
boards that turns everywhere to the same quiet geometry.
In the Ykrul lock–camps the ford–wardens taught me a mercy that counts: close a road and
spare a village. They braid their hair with routes and keep their promises like water kept in
stone. The Ecktorian surveyors draw lines taut as harp–strings; when their hammer falls once,
the world decides to be square. The Vhasian balconies polish the helm for the crowd while the
true cut lands in an alley without lamps. Viterran hinges close with a soft verdict; the gate
says “enough” and even horses bow. Aeler factors weigh a step like coin and bankrupt a road
before they bleed for it. The Vilikari bazaars clap a tempo, and by the third beat the lane you
needed is already for sale. Thepyrgosi brush sand until only one path remains; their victories
are read aloud like proofs. Ubral mists keep a weather of patience, and when it lifts you learn
you were four from drowning since yesterday. Silkstrand torches flare for theater while harvest
happens just beyond the light. Dhaharan guilds make courtesies that spend like silver; their tolls
are promises kept tomorrow. Oshiiran marshals count grain before steel and wake the road by
lamp–light. The Ashaani palaces prefer the veil to the knife, but keep the knife oiled for memory.
In Kahfagia the harbour–law is written with lanterns on water; jurisdiction moves like tide, and
only fools defy it. And in the Lethai groves a pond holds its face until the moon moves—when it
breaks once, everything is already over.
I have seen drovers humble dukes and a prince offer gold to keep a sanctum empty. If the road
has taught me anything, it is this: the world remembers routes, not rulers. Count the ways
forward, not the men before you. The rest is boast and weather.
Set at the Nine Lanterns Way–House on the reshima kah mharga.

The Ykrul Thirty–Six Sayings (Extracts)
They measure war not in strategies, but in breaths left to their foe.
1. Let the River Freeze Before You Cross
Do not rush from your Home Apex. A Blue that leaves too early is a calf separated from the
herd. Let the opponent make the first shape; your bridge will be built upon their impatience.
2. Borrow a Corridor to Trap a King
When the enemy carves a path toward your sanctum, let it deepen while you count his exits.
Then seal the mouth behind him. Their ambition becomes their tomb.
3. Kill With a Borrowed Blade
Your Reds are cheap. Their purpose is to be spent. Lure the enemy’s Orange into capturing
a Red, placing it where your Blue can hop over it and land clean on the empty square
beyond to strike a greater prize.
4. Watch the Fire Burn Across the River
When the enemy’s Blue is Rooted after a Seed, do not panic. They have spent their breath to
gain a piece. Use their immobility to post your lids and print your lanes. Let them burn their
own tempo.
5. Loot a Burning House
Strike only when the enemy is committed elsewhere. A Blue in the Cross is a house with one
door. A Blue after its second special is a house on fire. Plunder it.
6. Hide Your Dagger Behind a Smile
Telegraph a threat on one flank. When they shift their lattice to meet it, strike on the silent file
they were forced to weaken.
7. Cross the Sea by Fooling the Sky
Make a small, obvious move to hide a greater one. A Red slide of two squares can scream so
loudly it deafens them to your Orange sliding three elsewhere.
8. Cull a Kid to Save the Herd
A Green is a piece of tempo, not a piece of value. Let it be captured if it baits their Blue into a
square from which it cannot escape your true trap.
9. Take the Opportunity While He Counts Another Man’s Breaths
When your foe runs the Reforge, do not chase. Weld the penult squares to drown his lanes, or
open an SSI-safe Seed of your own while his eyes are on the banner clock.
10. Point at the Ford to Close the Sluice
Verbally threaten a Sanctum seed. Let them waste moves reinforcing it. Then seed from the
opposite Sanctum they left under-strengthened.
11. Draw the Log from Under the Cauldron
Do not attack the strong Blue head-on. Attack the weak Red that supports its escape route.
Remove the log, and the cauldron tips itself.
12. The Cicada Sheds its Shell
Leave a Red in a seemingly vulnerable position. When they capture it, they reveal the lane your
Green uses to sprint for their Home Apex in the endgame.
4
13. Shut the Doors to Catch the Thief
Do not chase the Reforge runner. Instead, seal every avenue to your own Home Apex. Let them
run themselves to exhaustion against walls of your making.
14. Feign Madness but Keep Your Balance
Let your board appear disordered, with gaps and holes. This is not madness. This is a throat,
and you are the one who controls when it closes.
15. Lure the Tiger Down the Mountain
Draw their Blue from its fortified Home Apex into the center. The steppe is vaster than their
stone keep. On open ground, the hunter has the advantage.
16. To Catch Something, First Set it Free
If you cannot immediately punish a Blue entering your territory, let it pass. Your pieces behind
it are a net it does not see. Capture it on its retreat, when its specials are spent and its paths
are closed.
17. Cast a Stone to Draw the Stallion
Sacrifice an Orange only when the net is already knotted. A Blue capture is jade if the five
breaths of Reforge are already dead on your map.
18. Defeat the Enemy by Capturing Their Chief
The game is not won by capturing pieces. It is won by capturing the Blue and then proving the
five breaths of Reforge are a death sentence. All other victories are illusions.
0. The Unwritten Strategy: Count Exits, Not Victims The greatest strategy is not listed,
for it is the breath before all breaths. Before you move, count the number of ways your foe can flee.
If the number is greater than zero, you have not yet won. You have only begun to fight.

middle stones—no more—or the river writes your name.
19. A toll taken in anger is two rebellions: one today, one remembered.
Court–Speaker Anala’s gloss: Set the price when the clay is cool; judgment that burns the hand
leaves no one fed.
24. Widen the path for carts you cannot stop.

27. Plant no depot where two roads can claim it back.
Guild gloss: Let the swift runner go only when the far watch has spent its will.
33. Three promises make a bridge: water, safety, and a record.
Canal–Scribe Ruyaka’s gloss: Without the ledger, safety is rumor; without safety, water is a trap.
41. Justice levied is cheaper than blood.
Treasury gloss: When the Court–Speaker moves, let it be to set a price or grant a passage; two
judgments in one market day root even the patient magistrate.
48. A guest’s road begins at your gate.
Caravan–Captain Devaya’s gloss: Escort shapes rumor; rumor shapes tribute. Walk them to the
first milestone and the second will walk to you.
52. Do not linger in the king’s square after the drums.
Temple–Reader Ś¯alini’s gloss: Applause hides nets. Step in, be seen, step out—leave the middle
stones for courtiers and fish.
60. Five dawns decide a winter.
V¯agra’s second gloss: If you cannot reach the enemy’s threshold in five mornings, you did not
begin with roads but with boasts.

68. The river forgives the cautious twice.
Lampkeeper’s second gloss: Once for delaying a crossing, once for sending a runner where the
bank was clear. The third delay is cowardice; the third sprint is waste.
73. A spared granary counts louder than a slain captain.
Treasury addendum: The people tithe to memory. Write your victories in bread.
81. Where the road splits, bind speech before steel.
Court–Speaker’s marginalia: Two loud orders make panic; one quiet price makes a line.
90. Never measure a kingdom by its walls; measure it by its fords.
Canal–Scribe’s colophon: Walls end at the river. Roads begin there.
1.2 From the Salon of Ava “Sable-Edge”
Certain Observations on the Art of the Game, Addressed to the Aspiring Bravo
Let it be stated thus: all men are ruled by their eyes. The common player believes he is moving
pieces upon a diamond; the adept knows he is moving impressions inside his opponent’s skull.
To win, you must master this second, hidden board.
I. On Appearances and Reality
It is of far more use to be seen as powerful than to be powerful in some quiet, invisible
way. A Blue posed aggressively upon the Central Four (the Cross), even if its exits are few,
commands more fear than a safely posted Blue that threatens nothing. Men surrender to
spectacles, not to calculations.
II. On Liberality and Parsimony
The generous player gives away tempos; the parsimonious one hoards them. But the wise
player appears generous while giving nothing of value. Sacrifice a Red not to gain a true
advantage, but to create the impression of your recklessness. This false carelessness is
the bait that draws your opponent into overreaching.
III. On Cruelty and Mercy
When you have the opportunity to capture a piece, you must do it with finality and in
the open. A swift, public capture is remembered and feared. A piece left alive out of
some misplaced mercy becomes a tool for your enemy’s gratitude, which is as fleeting as
smoke. It is safer to be feared than loved, for men will challenge a player they love but
will hesitate before one they fear.
IV. How a Player Should Avoid Being Despised
The two things that make a player despised are being predictable and being passive. To
be predictable is to be read; to be passive is to cede the initiative. Therefore, you must
cultivate a reputation for unpredictable aggression. Let your moves be a series of brilliant,
confounding flourishes. Even if one fails, you will be remembered for your audacity, not
your caution.
V. On the Use of Theatrics
All great moves serve two purposes: the move itself, and the story it tells. A Hop-capture
is not merely the removal of a piece; it is a dramatic leap, a narrative of unstoppable
force. Follow it on your next turn with a pivot to a Sanctum only if SSI ≥2 (your
Blue will be Rooted for a breath). The opponent, stunned by the spectacle, will not see
the quiet Red you advanced two turns ago to seal his exit.
7
VI. On the Wisdom of the Hop
It is better to hop once with devastating effect than to displace twice for minor gains.
The Hop is the ultimate argument; it cannot be parried once its lane exists. Deny it
beforehand by closing the landing or the step; keep one special in reserve to write the
final line of the scene.
VII. On Those Who Become Masters by Their Skill
Some will say mastery comes from study and discipline. This is the complaint of the
dull. True mastery comes from audacity sharpened by skill. The studied player knows a
hundred replies; the brilliant player invents a hundred and first. Do not be a slave to the
known patterns. Be the author of new ones.
VIII. On the Role of Fortune
Fortune is not dice but timing. She floods when you have opened sluices and runs dry
when you have closed them. When your opponent is Rooted by a Seed, that window is
your flood. Do not squander it on a timid probe. Unleash your most brilliant combination.
IX. A Final Admonition
Remember always: you are not a mere player. You are the director of a play in which
your opponent is the unwitting lead. Design the stage. Write the lines. Let him believe
the drama is of his own making. And when the final curtain falls, it will be to the sound
of your applause.
For in the end, it is not the victory that is remembered, but the style of its winning.

1.3 Oshiira — Grain and Spear: The Widow’s Judgment
What it is. A sworn field account by Ledger–Scribe Mesi ben Afya, taken three winters after the
Long Sorrow. The “Widow’s Judgment” is the queen’s walking audit of a campaign line—part
tribunal, part catechism of logistics—where promotions and punishments are given in the same
breath as rations.
We struck the market–square at third bell, when the heat had not yet lifted the smell of millet.
The queen came with no drum, only a clerk’s tablet and two lanterns on a pole. She set one lamp
to the east arch and one to the west and asked the Marshal, in a voice for counting, “Name me
two exits and the price for each.”
He gestured to men and steel. She shook her head. “Lanterns, not laurels.” We hung a ribbon
where an Orange should stand and chalked a mark where a Red would weld the penultimate stone.
The queen said, “A road that feeds you is already a wall,” and the square obeyed. Traders shifted
their baskets to our side of the ledge without a word.
A caravan captain, fat on private purchase, tried to push through. The queen took one pace—no
flourish—and placed her hand upon his axle. “Inspection,” she said.2 The cart was counted as
army property, its oxen watered, its owner fined in salt and forgiven in public. The rumor spread
quicker than the decree.
By dusk the Marshal begged leave to hold the square as a throne. “Three councils only,” the queen
replied, pointing to the lamps. “Touch the middle once, then name your way out. Linger, and
you will write your own encirclement.” We broke camp with the second lamp still warm.
On the fourth day we reached a quay sanctum with room for one more hull. The far port lay
idle across the strait. “Plant a storehouse,” the Marshal urged. The queen pressed her palm over
the ledger and did not write. “Not on the first breath from home,” she said. “Routes must be
named before promises are posted.” At dawn she returned, set the seal, and stood still while we
tallied—rooted one breath as the depot woke.3
The only time I saw her hurry was at a choke where two hills made a mouth. Bandits had cut a
line of carts across the gap. The queen raised the white writ, and the line opened as if the paper
were a blade.4 She lowered the writ and did not move again that watch. “Spend a cut to open
a lane,” she told the Marshal, “a leap to pass a choke—never both in one hour unless you can
afford to stand still.”
We took no city by storm that season. We closed prices instead of gates. Villages that feared our
lances learned to love our scales; the road itself came over to our side. Five dawns decided every
question, as her ledger promised. On the last morning she walked the line—wells kept, bridges
whole, stores sealed—and said only, “Count water before bodies.”
I have seen generals win squares and lose roads. The Widow wins roads and the squares fall in
behind them like obedient mules. If there is a secret to her judgment, it is this: the empire moves
because its grain moves, and the enemy stops when his does not. Grain and spear, in that order.
2Oshiiran officers euphemize a Blue–Displacement as “inspection”: the sovereign’s right to impound overreach.
3Seeding a distant depot (Green) “roots” the captain one turn: an Oshiiran proverb for pausing to make logistics
true.
than steel.
4 “White writ” is the courtly gloss for a Blue–Hop: a grant of safe passage that leaps a choke by ordinance rather

The Yard–Dialogue (The Cartwright)
Recounted by Kyrus, a student of the Lyceum; the scene is the public yard by the low boards,
where artisans play for copper and shade.
Kyrus. IwentdowntotheyardwithMenex, wishingtoseeacertainmancalledtheCartwright/foot-
noteRendered “Cartwright” from a Thepyrgosi term for wagon-maker; a sobriquet for a proof-builder,
for though he made no carts, he was said to set weights upon men’s thoughts until they bowed or
broke. We found him not in the porch of the Masters, but among brick–workers and sailors, by
the dust–scarred boards. He was sitting in silence. Around him stood youths and two or three
graybeards who smiled as if at a dare.
Menex. Is that him, Kyrus? He looks more like a clerk than a champion.
Kyrus. Hush; for here came Ionius the Kantós–Master, he of the perfect mirrors, trailed by
students with clean tablets. He greeted us with the cold courtesy of a winter sun and turned to the
Cartwright.
Ionius. You are the one who troubles boys with riddles. Will you play a match and let us be done
with fable?
The Cartwright. I will ask a question; if you answer, the match will answer itself.
Ionius. Always a question. Very well—set the stones.
I. On Form and Time
Ionius. (opening neatly) The form is good: twin Oranges advanced; your mirror is obliged.
The Cartwright. You speak of form as a statue speaks of stone. Tell me, Ionius, which wins—form
or time?
Ionius. Without form, there is no time worth counting.
The Cartwright. Then answer this: if two men walk with equal stride, but one has already begun,
who arrives first?
Ionius. The one who began—if they walk the same road.
The Cartwright. And the board has roads. So when you say “mirror me,” you ask me to be late
by your measure. Will you let me choose another clock?
Ionius. (smiling) Words. Move.
They play three quiet moves; the shapes are near twins. The Cartwright slides a Red one step
homeward into a square the Masters teach us to despise.
Menex. (whispering) He mis–stepped!
Kyrus. (uneasy) Or asked a question.
Ionius. (chiding) You deform your net.
The Cartwright. I deform your expectation. Tell me, does your doctrine forbid me this square?
Ionius. It is a weak square.
10
The Cartwright. Then let us see whether weakness is a square or a time.
II. The Lantern and the Wheel
Ionius strides his Blue to the Cross; there is a dignified pause. The Cartwright touches and leaves
at once, taking on exile.
Ionius. See, boys, how he flees the center. The lantern is leverage; he throws away the light.
The Cartwright. I accept night to keep the clock. Tell me, Ionius: your Blue in the Cross—how
many turns may it dwell?
Ionius. Three. That is law.
The Cartwright. And after it leaves, how long is it denied return?
Ionius. Two. That too is law.
The Cartwright. Then laws are clocks with numbers on them. My law now is other: I have served
my exile already. You have not. Who is nearer the second entrance—the one who played statue, or
the one who played wheel?
Ionius. You make a boast of cowardice.
The Cartwright. No; I make a count of breath. Tell me, if a man holds the dais, yet the hourglass
runs, what holds whom?
III. On Mirrors
Ionius. (tightening) Very well; I will teach with play. (He mirrors again, building a fence.)
The Cartwright. You speak often of “the mirror.” But tell me—when is a mirror a trap?
Ionius. When a fool stares into it too long.
The Cartwright. And when a wise man holds it before another man’s eyes, is it a trap for the
holder or the gazer?
Ionius. (irritated) For the gazer.
The Cartwright. Then take care: you have held it long. While you admired the likeness, I counted.
Your Cross–stays are two. Mine are none. When your third ends, you must go where you have not
planned; when my exile ends, I may enter where you have planned I would not.
Ionius. (to his students) Note how the sophist calls rules “clocks” and thinks that renaming them
is winning.
The Cartwright. I rename nothing. I only read aloud what your hand has written.
IV. The Heresy Stated
Menex. (bold now) Stranger, say plainly: what is your doctrine?
The Cartwright. A heresy, Menex, and therefore true in part. (He smiles.) Break the mirror; win
the clock. Do not ask: Is my shape correct? Ask: Which of his clocks does this move press? The
law is not a throne; it is a metronome. Do you dance to it or make him stumble?
11
Ionius. And when he does not stumble?
The Cartwright. Then you chose the wrong clock.
Ionius. (coldly) You corrupt boys with talk of clocks and refuse to teach form.
The Cartwright. I teach them to see that form without time is a statue in the road.
V. The Net That Isn’t There
The Cartwright slides an Orange not to block, but to look like a block; the true weld will be one file
over. Ionius burns a tempo to “reopen” a lane that was never closed.
Kyrus. (aside) He spends their care as if it were coin.
Menex. And the board? It looks... unchanged.
The Cartwright. (hearing us) Good. The better the lie, the less it moves.
Ionius. (sensing danger) What do you intend?
The Cartwright. Nothing new. You have told a story; I have offered two endings. You will choose
the wrong one, because the right one requires you to stop being yourself for a move.
Ionius. (flushes, plays to “punish” the apparent stopper)
The Cartwright. (quietly) There.
A small capture, a quiet Seed—timed when the punish was spent—and a weld two plies ahead. A
murmur runs around the yard. Ionius’s Blue is later taken; the Reforge race begins already short.
VI. The Five Breaths
Ionius. (grim) You have my Blue. I will plant in five.
The Cartwright. Will you? Name your two shortest lanes aloud, as soldiers name the gates they
will hold.
Ionius. (hesitates) The western... and— (he looks; the penultimates are salted with Reds, the fork
waiting unseen)
The Cartwright. The lanes you count are roads I priced while you kept the lantern. This is my
heresy: the board is not a picture; it is a schedule.
Ionius. (angry) You play against the spirit!
The Cartwright. I play against the hour.
Ionius fails the fifth breath by one step. There is no triumph—only the sound of men exhaling.
VII. The Indictment Foretold
Ionius. (to the crowd) You see what comes of learning in alleys. He unteaches reverence. He calls
law a metronome, center a lantern, courtesy a ledger. If the city is to be sound, such men must
drink the bitter tea.
12
The Cartwright. (gently) If the city is to be sound, such men must be asked better questions.
Kyrus. (stepping forward) Master—I mean, sir—what should we keep, if we break the mirror?
The Cartwright. Keep the counts. Keep mercy for men, and severity for clocks. Enter the Cross
to cast shadows, not to pose. Seed when the story has two exits for you and none for him. Spend a
special to change the chapter, not the applause. And when they ask your school, say only: I win by
making time uneven.
Ionius. (turning away) Remember, boys: there are courts for those who corrupt the young with
cleverness.
The Cartwright. (to us) If they summon me, I will go. If they offer tea, I will drink. Clocks run
everywhere, even in halls.
Menex. And what shall we call your doctrine?
The Cartwright. Call it nothing. But if you must, call it the Wheel.
Kyrus. Why?
The Cartwright. Because it moves.
He gathers the stones without pride and leaves them on the board as if to say: the question remains.
We stood a while in the dust, and the Masters’ lads pretended not to be thinking. I went home
with a stone in my pocket and a metronome in my ear.

1.4 Of the Royall Game of Canray: Certaine Precepts for the Accomplisht
Champion
As set downe by Dame Ysoria, called the Blood–Price, for the edification of her successors
Here Begynneth the Prologue
To the gentil and noble player, knowe that this Game is a battayle refyned, a duell of witts. Here
is no place for the churl or the coward. He that would master it must have the herte of a lyon
and the eye of a hawke. He must knowe when to shew the face of honour, and when to strik
with the daggere of necessitie.
Of the Four Maner of Pieces
The Blue, or Champion. He is thy honour and thy lyf. He must be seen to be valorous, yet not
spent in vayne. He beareth two strokes: the Displacement, which is a lordly challenge, and the
Hop, which is a vengeaunce from the shadwes. To use both is to shew thy hole hand; then art
thou Rooted for a breath, a mark for a tyme. Let the world see thy first stroke; keep the second
a secrete till the hour of need. Remember also, the Hop is best denied beforehand: close the step
or the landing, and the leape is unmade.
The Oranges, or Herauldes. These are thy right and left handes. Their strength lyeth in their
reach. Use one to proclayme intent with grete noyse and ceremonie. Use the other to performe
the deede that wyns the day, in silence.
The Reds, or Retayners. These are thy men–at–armes. Their worth is not in their lyves, but in
the ground they holde. They are the walles of thy castel, the hedges of thy lane. Spend them
gladly to shape the fielde to thy liking.
The Green, or Duelist. This one is not of thy household; he is a mercenarie, cald forth of the
Sanctum in thy hour of need. He is a blade hyred for a single thrust. Use him to sett a trap, or
to run a message of death to thy foeman’s dore, and thinke no more on him.
Precepts of Warre Upon the Diamond
I. Of the Shew of Honour. Let thy Champion advance with seemyng boldnesse upon the centre
ground, the Cross. Let him be seen of all. This is the Shew of Honour. It demandeth an answere.
While thy foeman is occupied with this spectacle, thy true purpose advanceth else–where, upon
the quiet file.
II. Of the Quiete File. For every action there is a lane left unwarded. For every eye drawne to
the shew, there is an eye turned away. This is the Quiete File. Thy Herauld or Duelist must
already be upon it, redy to strik when the sight of all is other–where.
III. Of the Two Strokes. The first stroke of thy Champion is for the gallerie. It is a chalenge, a
punishment for the forward enemie. It is seen and noted. The second stroke is for the victorie.
Spend it not to wyn a skirmish, but to ende the warre. He that useth his second stroke and
standeth Rooted in a place of perill hath traded his lyf for a moment of pryde.
IV. Of Seeding the Duelist. When thy Champion endeth his move upon the Sanctum, he may
call a Duelist from the opposite Sanctum. This is a grete encrease of strength, but it rooteth
him to the place for a breath. Do it not as first resort, but as finall gambit. Ensure thy Shew
of Honour hath drawne his Champion far hence, or that SSI is in thy favour; then thy Rooted
breath is payd for.
V. Of Death and Reforge. Should thy Champion fall, the world groweth blacke, yet it is not
ended. Thou hast five breaths of thine owne to plante thy banner upon thy foeman’s Home
Apex. This is the Reforge. Chuse thy runner wysely; the Duelist is swiftest. If thou do plant,
thou mayst restore thy Champion thus:
14
• At the Foeman’s Home. A vengeaunce at his very gate; but it costeth the lyf of a
Duelist.
• At a Sanctum. A shrewd retrait; yet from that Sanctum thou shalt never call a Duelist
agayne.
• At Thine Owne Home. A prudent withdraw; to lyve to fyght agayne is no shame.
The Finall Precept
The vulgare player thinketh the Game is won by taking pieces. The master knoweth it is won
by taking choices. Thy purpose is not to slea his men, but so to order the fielde that his every
motion is folie, and his onlie path is that which thou hast prepared for his undoing.
Polych the helm in publicke; sharpen the knife in privatie.

1.5 Ashaani — The Veil and the Knife: A Vizier’s Private Counsel
What it is. A suppressed memorandum attributed to Vizier Setheru, circulated in copy among court
clerks after the First Restoration. It strips the liturgy from rule and replaces it with mechanics:
appearances, timing, and cost.
Majesty, they will anoint you with hymns of Balance and Ever-Order. Keep them for festivals.
In chambers where edicts are born, the tongue is plainer. There we speak of the Veil and the
Knife.
On the Sovereign’s Two Hands. Your person bears two instruments. The first is the Open
Palm: the public correction, the gift that is also a tax.5 The second is the Hidden Blade: the
unseen reach that steps over what is loud to touch what is true.6 Spend both hands in one breath
and you show the stagecraft; the mask slips, the court sees a man sweating. When that happens,
you must stand very still until the illusion mends.7
On Raising a Wonder (Sanctum Seed). To call a loyalist from a far circuit is a marvel
in the eyes of the provinces. But even marvels need quiet streets. Do it when the doubters have
spent their voice or are far from the square. Perform it while a skeptic stands armed before you,
and you invite a sermon at your expense. And never promise a wonder the first day you leave
the palace; routes must be named before banners appear.
On the Middle Stones (The Central Four). The procession ground is for crossings, not
thrones. Touch it, be seen, and name the way you will leave. Linger a third audience and the
crowd begins to count your breaths for you; a sovereign who overstays the dais is negotiating with
his own statue. When you descend, do not return too quickly. Let absence do its work.
On Unthinkables (Reforge). If the mask is struck from your face—yes, it happens—you
have five breaths to reassert the story. Plant your standard on the rebel’s very altar; the city will
remember which god stood there last. It will cost you blood of your own—better a trusted courier
than a province.8 Failing boldness, return to a loyal circuit and accept that its fountain will
never again pour wonders for you. Failing prudence, go home and rebuild the calendar; eternity
is long, and your memory must be longer.
The Final Truth. Rule is not love. Rule is accounting. Make obedience cheaper than defiance
and dress the arithmetic in silk. Offer them the Veil of order; keep the Knife for when silk tears.
The world is a board of permitted roads. Those who forget that are moved. Those who remember,
move others.
5Court euphemism for a Blue Displacement: a one-step adjacently imposed removal.
6Court euphemism for a Blue Hop-capture: leaping an adjacent foe to the empty square beyond, removing the
jumped piece.
7In table terms: using the second capture special in the same Blue life triggers the Crown Stagger rooting until the
next turn.
8Opposing–Apex placement after banner plant requires sacrificing a Green; placing on a Sanctum forbids Seeding
from that Sanctum for that Blue’s life; Home Apex is free.

1.6 The Viterran His Booke of Stone and River
Advisements for the Gate–Minder, by the Hand of Lady Brigid
A Fore–Word to the Player
If thou wouldst play, then first lay down thy pride.
This art is not for rash and fyry mindes
That seek a speedy glory. Here abyde
The patient and the stout of hart. He fyndes
His victory not in one stroke well plac’d,
But in the ground well held, the lane well grac’d.
I. Of the Pieces and Their Proper Use
The Blue, which is the Gate–Minder. He is thy charge and purpose. His true strength Is not to
range abrode in search of fyght, But holde the key, and measure out the length Of his dominion.
Keepe him in thy syght. He beareth two cuts: Displacement and Hop.
Spend not the second till the road is shut;
With both cuts spent, thy charter standeth bare.
(Remember: close the step or landing, and the leape is unmade.)
The Oranges, which are the Wardens twaine. Thy loyal lordes, whose reach doth serve thy will.
With these thou surveyst the brode demayne And mak’st thy borders. Let them holde the hill
And fork the pathes, that none may passe thee by.
Their worth is in the territory deny’d.
The Reds, which are the Pickets. The humble stone, the stake, the stedfast poste.
On these thy great design shalt thou erect.
Their value lyeth not in warlike boaste, But in the silent ground that they protect.
Spend them with purpose, not with wylde despayre;
Build bridge and hedge, and block the vitall square.
The Green, which is the Scout. A fleeting sprite, calld forth from out the mist When at a Sanctum
thou dost make thy call.
He is a message that must be deliver’d,
A sudden threat, a name to be inscrib’d.
Use him to run the causeway thou hast built,
And thinke no more on him.
II. Advisements on the Play
First: Build thy Fence. Let not thy first conceit be piece on piece.
Thy foremost thought must be to chuse thy ground,
And with thy Pickets work the land to peace,
So all thy lanes by warden posts are bound.
A Red home–stepping, welding back the track,
Makes stronger walles than Red that rushes slack.
Then: Owne the Road. The game is won by him that holds the way,
Not he that hoards the biggest, costliest stones;
But he that sayth “Thou shalt not passe to day,”
And makes of every lane his river’s bones.
Turn every path into thy tolling ford;
He’ll drowne in currents he must walke untoward.
The Central Four: a Timèd Well. The Cross doth tempt the rash and heedless mind
To bide upon its brief and borrow’d ground.
17
A Minder there may three of his turns fynd;
But tarry past thy plan, and thou art bound.
Enter with exits prov’d, then quit anon;
Two turns exil’d the Cross when once thou’rt gone.
The Seed: a Calculated Risk. To plant a Scout from far Sanctum is gain,
Yet rooteth fast thy Minder for a breath.
Choose SSI in favour, else abstain;
Seed not so soone as to invite his death.
Plant when the fielde is quiet and well–fenc’d,
So Rooted cost is payd and not expens’d.
III. Of Loss, and the Reforge
If thy Minder fall, then cometh trial’s theame.
Thy foe hath five of his to plant a banner Upon thy Home Apex, and close the scheme.
If he faile that march, thy charter’s hammer’d
Anew—thy Blue returneth to the board.
If he prevayle, then choosest thou thy ford:
• At thy Foeman’s Home. A vengeaunce at his gate; it costeth one Green’s breath.
• At a Sanctum. Shrewd retrait; yet from that Sanctum thou shalt never call a Green
agayne.
• At Thine Owne Home. The prudent hold; to lyve to fyght agayne is no shame.
The Finall Advisement
Let others hunt the bright and bloudy hour,
The sudden Hop, the theatre of play.
Thy victorie lyeth in the patient power
To owne the road, and so command the way.
Stake thou the lane full early; march shall follow.
Possesse the road, and choke thy hallow foe

1.7 Axiomatic Foundations & Formal Procedures of the System Canré
Thepyrgosi Institute for Logical Purity Tractatus Logico–Ludicus
I. Definitions & Initial Conditions
I.1 System. A deterministic, finite–state machine on a dual–axis grid indexed by (o, h). A state
is the multiset of all token types and their coordinates.
I.2 Tokens. Four token classes by function: Arbiter (Blue), Corollary (Orange), Lemma (Red),
Q.E.D. (Green). Each class has a defined movement budget along a single lane per operation.
I.3 Initial state. Symmetric array S0 per protocol; see initial setup figure for (o, h) placements.
II. Core Axioms of Motion
II.1 Axiom of linear propagation. A token moves along exactly one cardinal lane per operation.
No mid–operation change of lane is permitted.
II.2 Axiom of non–interpenetration. A token may not occupy an already occupied square. Paths
must be vacant except as permitted by III.
II.3 Axiom of Zone of Control (ZoC). Each token exerts ZoC on its four cardinal neighbors (the
HL/HR/OL/OR squares in the pre–rotate frame). A moving token may enter hostile ZoC, but
the operation terminates upon entry. Movement through hostile ZoC is forbidden.
III. Arbiter–class Functions
III.1 The Arbiter possesses two unique one–per–life functions: Displacement and Hop–capture.
III.2 Displacement (s:D). Move the Arbiter one square along its current lane onto a hostile
token; remove that token; the operation ends.
III.3 Hop–capture (s:H). Move the Arbiter over one adjacent hostile token along its current lane
to the immediately subsequent empty square; remove the hopped token; the operation ends. The
landing square must be empty. Note: preventing the landing square prevents the hop.
III.4 Crown stagger. Upon execution of the second distinct function in a single life, the Arbiter
acquires the Rooted state until the start of its controller’s next turn. Rooted tokens cannot move
and may still be captured.
IV. Q.E.D. Token Generation Protocol (Twin Apex Seed)
IV.1 Condition. If an Arbiter ends its operation on a Sanctum, the global Green count is less
than six, and the opposite Sanctum is vacant, the controller may trigger a Seed event.
IV.2 Procedure. Place one Green on the opposite Sanctum.
IV.3 Post–state. The triggering Arbiter becomes Rooted until the start of its controller’s next
turn.
IV.4 Mobilization delay. This protocol is unavailable on the same turn that Arbiter first departs
its Home Apex for its current life.
V. Central Four Subsystem
V.1 The Central Four (CF) is the 2 ×2 center diamond.
V.2 Stay timer. An Arbiter may end at most three of its own turns in the CF per life. A fourth
such attempt is illegal.
V.3 Exclusion timer. After an Arbiter ends a turn outside the CF, it may not re–enter the CF
for the next two of its own turns.
VI. Arbiter Capture & Reforge
VI.1 Upon capture of an Arbiter, initialize a counter c = 5 for the capturing side. The counter
decrements by one at the end of each turn of the capturing side.
VI.2 Banner plant. If any token of the capturing side ends its operation on the opponent’s
19
Home Apex before c reaches zero, remove that token and immediately reintroduce the captured
Arbiter by one of the following:
• Opposing Apex. Place on the opponent’s Home Apex; cost: sacrifice one of your Greens.
• Sanctum. Place on either Sanctum; cost: this Arbiter may never trigger protocol IV from
that Sanctum for the remainder of the game.
• Home Apex. Place on your Home Apex; cost: none.
In all cases, the Arbiter’s special functions reset to unused; the counter is cleared.
VI.3 Failure. If c reaches zero without a banner plant, the capturing side loses immediately
by lapse; the side whose Arbiter was captured wins and their Arbiter returns per normal
reintroduction procedure.
VII. Concluding Remarks
The optimal line is the earliest identification of inevitable state transitions. Material is incidental;
inevitability is terminal. The superior player is the one who recognizes the forced proof first.

1.8 Kahfagia — The Pilot’s Mirror; or, The Admiralty of Advantage
What it is. A strategist’s handbook taught at the Harbour Collegium—essays on maneuver, supply,
and reputation—with marginal citations to confederal sea-law. Less a code than a way to think:
the fleet as a network, victory as jurisdiction.
Preface. The sea does not reward force; it rewards position. Storms are survived by those who
already held the lea. So too in contests of lanes: win the water first, and hulls will follow.
§3. On Jurisdiction of the Central Straits. The straits belong to all and to none. Touch
them for advantage; name your egress before the bell. A flag that lingers three councils invites
suspicion of tyranny; when it strikes, it must keep off those waters two councils more, that
commerce not fear a standing blockade.9
§7. On Letters and Rights. An Admiral bears two instruments only. The Right of
Inspection boards a craft at hand and impounds mischief;10 the Right of Convoy Passage
takes a sworn corridor through a living press, emerging where trade most needs him.11 To wield
both in one engagement is extraordinary; the chamber will require him to stand down until the
next vote, that no man make himself a sea-law unto his own will.12
§11. On Packets and Berths. A packet (the swift runner) is a promise more than a ship.
Dispatched from one free port to its sister, it binds the sea to your timetable—if the far berth
stands empty and the water is not already thick with our colors. The Admiral who inaugurates a
route on his first voyage is a poet, not a pilot; charts precede schedules. And when a packet sails,
the Admiral stays in harbour one tide—let that tell you when to do it, and when to wait.13
§18. General Average of War. In a hard gale we cut the mast to save the hull; so too you
may scuttle a packet to raise your flag upon a hostile dock. Call it cruelty if you must; the law
calls it average. Lose the smaller value to preserve the voyage. If your flagship founders, you
have five tides to assert salvage on the enemy’s mooring; fail, and the sea writes a different
log.14
§22. On Reputation as Weather. Charts are drawn with ink; routes are drawn with memory.
Do not bar the same channel twice without cause, nor promise two ports the same berth. A fleet
feared is a storm; a fleet trusted is the current itself. The former wins battles; the latter wins
seasons.
§28. On Counting Exits Before Broadside. Fire is loud; contracts are quiet. Before you
strike in the straits, count which harbours you can make on the next bell and the bell after. One
certified exit is seamanship; two is strategy. None is theatre, and the reef keeps the receipts.
Postscript. We do not aim to sink every ship. We aim to make every profitable route pass
beneath our lanterns. Where the tariff is ours and the tide is ours, the war is already adjudged.
9Lore gloss of the “Central Four” timer and re-entry interval.
10Blue Displacement—adjacent removal along a lane.
11Blue Hop-capture—leap over an adjacent foe to the empty square beyond.
12Crown Stagger: using the second special in the same Blue life roots the Blue for one of its turns.
13Sanctum Seed, with mobilization delay and rooting of the Blue.
14Opposing-Apex placement costs a Green; Reforge countdown is five of the defender’s turns.

1.9 “The Hedge-Layer’s Tale”
(a country chapbook, worm-nibbled at the corners; hand unknown)
PROEM.
In hedges and in gutters have I seen
Canray played coarse but cunning, trim and clean:
No silken proofs, nor lantern-camping pride,
But roads well laid where loaves and banners ride.
Who wills to win by hedge and oven’s heat,
Mark now my tale, and set thy posts full meet.
The Tale
There dwelt a hedge-layer, Jankin Loaf-and-Lantern,
Who’d never chase the Cross nor brag nor canter’n;
He’d set two Reds like stakes beside a stile,
Then Orange gate the lane and grin the while.
A Blue he kept as warden—no show, no strut—
It proved two exits, nodded, and stayed shut.
“First hedge,” quod he, “then harvest: bread from roads.
Spend not thy specials twice ere set thy loads.”
A Vhasian cockerel, helm bright as brass,
Cried, “Meet me at the lantern, lad, and pass!”
Jank kissed his teeth: one HML to bank a breath,
Then posts a gate that pinched the cock to death—
Not dead in men, but dead in tempo’s count;
The cock must hop or root and pay the mount.
Jank touched the Cross but once (a toll, not tent),
Named two safe exits—left content, and went.
He reached the Sanctum, slid, and—soft as seed—
He sowed a Green where twin apex had need;
His Blue sat Rooted one meager country turn,
But hedge ran deep; he watched the city burn.
“Now sellvec,” whispers he—the hem is made—
At penultimate square he laid his blade:
Not sword of steel, but S:D kept snug and sure,
To weld or break the door and make it pure.
The city cock, out-crowed, blew both his charms,
Staggered, and sat a turn without his arms;
Jank’s runner slipped, the posts denied all succor,
The banner flew—no gilded song, but pucker.
He drank brown ale and carved his loaf in three:
“One slice for hedge, one lane for family;
The third for tolls—who’d cross must pay me bread.
Who’d prance at lantern? Sleep there in its stead.”
[sellvec: From šelvek, Fhara “hem/finished edge,” the final lane-seal.]
22
Addendum (a market note on Viterrans).
Came then a Viterran, all gate and stone,
Who fenced the road and called the lane his own;
Jank waited, banked a breath, then—door-time near—
He spent S:D to pry the penult clear.
“Gate first, road later,” murmured iron men;
“Loaf first,” quoth Jank, “then come collect again.”
Marginal Gloss (a hedge-scribe’s hand)
• Hedge first, harvest later. Post R/O on the banner lane; do not enter Cross till XS ≥1
(name the exits aloud).
• Bank a breath. A small homeward tick (HML/HMR 1) flips last move on the lane; you’ll
feel it fifteen plies hence.
• One toll at lantern. [CF: in 1/3] → out. No camping at 3/3 unless it wins now.
• Seed only when screened. Respect Mobilization; commit at SSI ≥1.
• Save Displacement for the door. S:D makes the šelvek (or breaks theirs) at the penulti-
mate.
• Greens aren’t geese. One runner good; a flock only if cap math profits you.

1.10 Lethai - Whisperings of the Valewood
(as overheard from Maerin Quiet–Step and set upon damp vellum)
To play is to misunderstand. To move is to err. Sit with the stone. Know the stone. Be the
stone.
The One Breath Becomes Five
The Blue is not a piece; it is the still pool beneath alder and star. It commands nothing; it reflects
all. Its two ripples the stone’s drop and the heron’s strike must be spent only when the sky is
perfect. Spend both and the water clouds a clouded pool sees nothing. A pool that has given both
ripples is nailed for a breath.
The Oranges are not pieces; they are deep roots of yew. They do not seek the sun. They hold the
earth. One root anchors. Another strangles the stone that thought itself eternal.
The Reds are not pieces; they are ten–thousand leaves. One leaf is nothing. A country of leaves
is a map. They do not attack; they accumulate. What accumulates, decides.
The Green is not a piece; it is a samara loosed from a far branch. It is not called; it is released.
It travels only to the place already prepared by patient rot.
The Un–Moving Way
The center is not a keep; it is a season. Three turns of clear weather, then frost. After frost, two
turns of silence before the thaw. Enter with a way out already grown.
To loose a seed is to trouble the pool. A troubled pool may not walk for a breath. Loose it only
when the air is so still that a single drop is thunder. On the day the pool first leaves its spring, it
may not loose a seed. First steps are for walking, not for calling rain.
The Fall and the Five Breaths
If the pool is shattered, do not chase the shards. Five breaths pass for the shatterer before drought.
In those breaths, water must find the cleft already waiting. Weld the penultimate stones, and the
river dies of thirst; open the quiet run, and your own seed rides the grain of the wood.
To return the pool is to choose its bed:
• Return it to the shattered vessel pay a seed to memory.
• Return it to the far branch promise no seed will ever spin from that bough.
• Return it to the source remember the rain.
The Final Teaching
The victory is not the capture. The capture is the sigh after the song. The work was the forest’s
growing. When the last shape is shown, do not say “I win.” Say “The shadow falls exactly here.”
Move until the board has only one truth. Then show it.
24
1.11 Vilikari - The Kanry Chapbook
(as kept by Rek Tarev, caravan factor and sometime tutor of street princes)
Things we sell: time, exits, confidence. The board is a market, and every move is a price. Buy
cheap, sell loud, leave first.
Goods & Tools (know your stock)
• Blue (Boss). Two cuts in a lifetime: Displacement and Hop. Spend one to open the stall;
keep one to shut the gate. Use both and you stand Rooted for a breath while the crowd
counts your purse.
• Oranges (Barkers). Long arms to move foot traffic. One barks to draw eyes; the other
closes the quiet aisle.
• Reds (Stalls). Signposts and counters. You don’t win with stalls; you win with where they
stand.
• Green (Runner). A paid courier. Comes from the far Sanctum when the Boss ends on a
Sanctum and the opposite is empty; the Boss is then nailed for one of your turns. Treat
the Runner as an invoice, not an heirloom.
Markets (where the money is)
• Central Four. A pop-up fair: three of your turns maximum to linger, then out; once you
step off, you owe two turns away before you touch it again. Enter only with a certified exit
(XS ≥1).
• Sanctums. Cash windows on the sides. Ending the Boss there lets you Seed a Runner on
the opposite Sanctum if vacant and the global cap permits; first departure of a Boss’s life
never allows it (Mobilization Delay). Seeding nails you for one breath—budget for it.
Clocks (what actually gets paid)
• Three in the Cross, two in exile, one Rooted on Seed, Rooted on second special,
five turns for Reforge after a Blue falls. If your deal ignores a clock, it isn’t a deal—it’s
debt.
Hustles (the Kanry way)
1. Sell the hour you stole. As second player, your opening double uses two different pieces;
make two problems for one answer. A Barker forward and a Stall that prints a lane forces
a discount somewhere.
2. Price-tag swap. Telegraph a Central Four raid; actually buy the side file. If they reinforce
the show, Seed on SSI (their Boss distant or down a special) and let Rooted pass under
your Barkers’ cover.
3. The quiet invoice. Don’t chase small captures; post Reds at penultimate squares
on likely banner lanes. When a Blue dies, your invoices come due in five turns—his
or yours.
4. One cut in pocket. Spend one Boss special to open the shop; keep the other to
shut their best exit later. A Kanry without a last trick is just a stall in the wind.
25
5. Poison capture test. A “free” Blue is only free if the five-turn banner graph is
already dead. If you cannot plant under ZoC in ≤4, you didn’t win a king—you
bought a lawsuit.
6. Rent the Cross, don’t buy it. Touch, tax, leave. Three turns max; every extra
heartbeat is paying top coin for floor space.
7. Seed on a pull, not a push. Seed after your showpiece pulls their screens off
the opposite Sanctum. Rooted is safe when their Barkers are out of position and
SSI ≥2 in your favor.
8. Reforge is a kiosk, not a cathedral. If yours falls, pick the restart that sells
the next tempo: Opposing Apex (sack a Runner) for a storefront brawl, Sanctum
to hold a flank but close that window forever, Home when the market’s hot and you
just need inventory back on shelves.
Openings (house lines)
• Peddler’s Swerve. Double: Barker onR 3, Stall onL 2. Threaten Cross, buy the side
aisle. If they mirror, swap flanks and cash the empty SSI.
• Stall & Swap. Early twin Stalls on homeward lanes, then a Barker pivot to re-price the
opposite file; Cross touch only with XS in hand.
Final till-count. We don’t hoard captures; we hoard choices. Make two threats for one answer,
spend noise to buy position, and leave with more exits than you arrived with. If the crowd
remembers a flourish, fine. If they don’t, count the coin.
Sell them the hour you stole.
26
1.12 Testimony — Brother Mavron, Scribe of the River-House at St. Valerius
Provenance
Lifted from a worm–eaten ledger board recovered on Silkstrand’s south quay after the spring flood. The
text is scratched into reused wax and overlaid in brown ink; a later hand has cross–tallied wells and grain
stores in the margins. Attributed internally to “Brother Mavron,” a bookman in forced service to the
Acasian warlord Rothari during the Ten Winters (c.630 A.R.). Portions exhibit heat–warping; several
lines are interpolated where the wax had slumped.
I was taken from the river–house on a wet Feast of Lanterns and told I would “write law where
law will march.” They put me in a leather cart with the salt and the scales and made me follow
Rothari’s banner as if it were an altar.
He has no letters; he has measures. He cannot read a psalm, but he can count a day’s forage by
the angle of a mule’s ribs, and fix a tithe by the sound a poor man makes when he swallows stale
bread. When I set down his sayings, I find no mercy, only arithmetic. s At the first bridge he
asked me, “What is a span worth?” I began to answer in timber and labor. He waved me off and
had three debtors hanged where the tollman could see them. “Now the span is worth this much,”
he said, “because men prefer to live.” He bade me write: Let the bridge that pays stand; let the
bridge that will not, swim.
In a hamlet of reed–cutters he ordered their well salted, then sent two skins of water to each
house “so they do not die too quickly to learn.” I protested that this was needless. He smiled and
counted aloud to five on his fingers, one for each day before the river rose. “Deny the empty
mile,” he said, “and you do not have to fight it.”
He plays the roads as gamblers play Canré. He never holds the center; he uses it to make the
edges worse. He will park a squad where all can see them, then move one file aside in the night
so that the only safe path is through his price. When I warned that the steppe folk would hate
him, he laughed: “Hate pays when it must pass.”
Prisoners he counts by use. If they have hands that lift, he marks them for mills; if they have
sons who can run, he marks them for ransom; if they have nothing but grievances, he marks
them for the river. He does not rant. He does not gloat. He asks what the thing is for. If I say
“justice,” he says, “For whom.”
Once, after a skirmish at the saffron ferry, he found a boy hiding with a slate scratched into a
diamond and four colored pebbles. The boy called it Canray. Rothari took the blue stone, put
it on the center of the slate, and said, “If you stay there three breaths, you will drown on the
fourth.” Then he put the stone on the corner and said, “If you plant here, a village dies.” He
gave the slate back and told the boy to leave before dusk. “Learn the corners first,” he said, “then
the water.”
He asks me every evening what I have written. I read him his own words and hope they sound
shameful when spoken. They never do. He nods as if I were tallying sacks of barley and says,
“Good. Tomorrow we salt one less well and burn one more stack.” I am to make a fair copy for
his captains, with marks where a ferry can be raised in half a day. He calls these fire–laws. I call
them grief.
I pray for a learned prince to unmake him. I pray for snow to smother the roads. I pray for the
sea to reach up and drag the bridges down. I pray, most of all, that my hand fails, for I see that
ink is a torch in such service, and every clean line I draw is a path he will walk.
If I do not live to scrape this wax clean, let whoever reads know: he is not mad. He is not
ignorant. He is exact. And it is the exactness that kills.

1.13 Letter: Rekedim to Duke Braedon Fenwood
Black Banners quartermaster’s awning, late thaw
To His Grace, Duke Braedon Fenwood,
from Sgt. Rekedim Many-Scars of the Red Bill Cadre (Black Banners)
You asked for the first movement that made my doctrine. I remember a canvas awning, oat-sacks
for a table, and the supply sergeant’s knuckles white with chalk. “Camp is a board,” he told me.
“Count roads, not bread.”
I led Red to brush the Cross and he grunted approval. “That is a cut. Now do not chase. Fork the
far mouth with Orange, two exits, both priced.” I did as told and the lane tightened like a throat.
My hand went to Blue. He caught my wrist. “Not yet. Rent the middle, do not buy it. If they
take your Blue, plant your banner at their Home and reforge behind their tolls while they are still
paying for the first mistake.”
We played three breaths more. A hinge closed and the gate said “enough.” I did not smile. I counted,
Cross three in and two out, and only moved when the math said now. The sergeant nodded at the
overlap where our Oranges met. “That is a weld. Win with welded routes.”
I carried that lesson forward. My fights since have been tariffs more than charges: weld first, float
the reforge, make them pay to leave and pay to return. The rest is patience and proper pricing.
If you must give it a name in your Corpus, let it be the sergeant’s in my ear that day: fork first;
tax later.
Your servant in clear roads,
Rekedim

1.14 Aeler - Principia K’thra: Ordinances of Road and Ledger
Issued under the seal of the Office of Ludic Weights and Roads, and affirmed by
Factor-Green Emsdir.
Preamble. The diamond is not a field of battle, but a work of ways. Each square is a toll-node;
each lane a causeway to be weighed. Victory is the proving of accounts: thy roads made sound,
thy adversary’s ways made dear.
Article I — Of the Instruments.
• Auditor (Blue). Holds two chartered cuts in a single life: Displacement (one step onto a
hostile stone to remove it) and Hop (leap over one adjacent hostile along a lane, alighting
on the empty square beyond and removing the hopped stone). Upon the second cut in that
life, the Auditor falls under Audit Rest (Rooted) until thy next turn.
• Factors (Oranges). Long-reach tollmen; placed to cast a toll-shadow (ZoC) and bend
traffic.
• Wayposts (Reds). Stakes and milestones; expended to print lanes and choke mouths.
• Courier (Green). A swift dispatch raised by writ when the Auditor ends a turn on a
Sanctum, and the opposite Sanctum stands empty. Upon such Seed, the Auditor is under
Audit Rest for one of thy turns. Mobilization Delay: the first departure of an Auditor’s life
never permits Seed. By statute the world holds at most six Couriers.
Article II — Of Interchanges and Exactions.
• The Crossing of Four Ways (Central Four). Thou may’st tarry there at most three
of thine own turns; once thou departest, two of thine own turns must pass ere thou re-enter.
• Toll-shadow (ZoC). A stone arrests travel upon entry to the four cardinal neighbors of
its lanes; thou may’st step into such shadow, but not pass through it.
Article III — Of the Five Clocks.
• Stay in the Crossing: three turns.
• Exile from the Crossing: two turns after leaving.
• Audit Rest on Seed: one turn.
• Audit Rest on second special: one turn.
• Reforge Count: five of the foe’s turns after thy Auditor is taken.
Article IV — Of Receivership (Reforge) when the Auditor Falls.
• When thy Auditor is removed, the adversary’s count begins at five; at each end of their
turn it lessens by one. If the count expire ere thou plant a banner upon their Home Apex,
thou art undone.
• Banner Plant. If any of thy stones end a turn upon the foe’s Home Apex, remove that
stone and restore thy Auditor with books made clean, choosing one seat:
– Opposing Apex: pay by sacrificing one of thy Couriers.
– Either Sanctum: future Seed from that Sanctum is forfeit.
– Thine Own Apex: no fee.
29
• Upon return, both Auditor’s cuts are renewed.
Article V — Maxims of Husbandry.
• Let every lane pay. Post Factors such that entries fall short within thy toll-shadow.
• Rent the Crossing, do not dwell. Enter with a certified exit (XS ≥1), levy what may
be levied, then quit.
• Seed upon the pull. Call a Courier only when the screens are drawn off and special-safety
is thine (their Auditor distant or down a cut); the Audit Rest must be afforded.
• Keep one cut in purse. Spend one charter to open the shop; reserve the other to shut
the richest gate.
• Prove the banner-road before the head. A “free” Auditor is poison if thou canst not
plant beneath interdiction in four or fewer of their turns.
Conclusion. Work the vein, set the waybeam, weigh the coin. If thou canst not, the gate stands
barred.

1.15 Saikou — The Red Lamps See All
Vasskandar Red Lamp District, night tide
Preface in Saikou’s hand. The penny sheets have a real talent for color. Unfortunately, the lack a
real talent for narrative, writing quality, or accuracy. But, they are vivid...
I met him on the quay between saffron and rope, where the river breathes twice before the sea. Two
lamps were already hung. One by the mooring post where men pretend the world is square. One
above the side stairs that forget names.
“Stand where the light touch your shoes,” I said. He obliged. Some men need lines drawn for them.
“It was a busy third bell,” I said to the water. “A baluster went soft at the weigh-bridge. Chalk
finds the place before the crack does.”
He watched a gull. “Bridges tire.”
“They do,” I said. “And sometimes a gatehand expects them to. Left pocket, top fold, a stamp that
smells of cumin. Family keeps familiar ink.”
He blinked, slow. I let the lamps do their counting.
“Midday was crowded,” I went on. “A seal paused where the foreman could see it and then moved
along. Not long enough to own the place. Long enough to make everyone look up.”
“That happens.”
“It does. And in the looking up, a cart walked out by one light and came home by the other, and
the road learned a new name for the same spice.” I placed a chit on the crate between us and did
not open it. “Names are expensive after dusk.”
He glanced at the stairs. The side lamp swung a little. Tide makes everything confess in small
motions.
“Another small thing,” I said. “A coil of cloth in a crate meant to be missing at high water. Cloth is
brave when it thinks the harbor will return it under color of law.”
“I am only a tallyman.”
“Then you will appreciate this.” I stepped half a foot so the two lights crossed at his instep. “Three
in. Two out. One road is dear, one is free.”
He looked down.
“The free road is narrow,” I said. “It passes my clerk. She is very good at remembering how stamps
find the wrong pocket. The dear road is the stairs to the magistrate. He is very good at forgetting
the difference between tide and theft.”
We let the river breathe again. He chose to end his story in ink, not water. Most men do when the
night turns and the lamplighters are watching.
Marginal hand. I hung two lights. The harbor did the arithmetic.

1.16 Aelinnel - Marginalia Upon the Diamond–Proof
(Found in a narrow hand, crowding the vellum of a borrowed Aeler ledger.)
... & thus the Primacy of the Four, being the first perfect number, is proved not by the Old
Canonists but by the Board itself. Observe.
The Axioms, Quick & Necessary
I. The Board is a tension–field of potentialities; its strains are resolved only by the placing of
a Stone, which is a crystallised probability. To move is to collapse a wave of maybe into the
certain–is.
II. The Arbiter (Blue). It is Unity, the prime mover. Its value is 1, yet it contains potential
for two operations: the Direct Substitution (s:D) and the Transpositional Leap (s:H). Mark this:
to enact both within one life resolves its momentum to zero; Unity becomes a sink in the field
and is Rooted until the cycle renews. Beautiful.
III. The Corollaries (Orange). They are the first primes, eccentric and long of reach. One
states a thesis, the other its answer; together they bound the argument.
IV. The Lemmas (Red). They are the steadfast integers, common and foundational. Their
purpose is to be factored out to simplify the proof; leaves upon which the theorem walks.
V. The Q.E.D. (Green). It is the variable x summoned into being; the spark that solves for
y. Yet the world’s sum bears but six such variables at once; the grand coefficient may not be
exceeded.
The Operations, Annotated
Sanctum Generation is not a move; it is an algebraic manipulation. When Unity ends a turn
upon a nodal point of power (Sanctum), and the opposite node is empty, a variable may be called
to that opposite node, provided the world–sum of variables be < 6. The act consumes Unity’s
momentum until the next turn. Mobilisation Delay: the first departure of a life never permits
this call.
Of Entries into Shadow (ZoC). The four near squares that lie along the lanes about any stone are
its shadow. One may step into such shadow, yet the step ends at once; to pass through shadow
is forbidden.
The Central Four is the demonstration itself. One does not dwell in the proof; one passes through
it. Three of one’s own turns is the limit case. After departure, two of one’s own turns must
elapse ere re–entry, lest constants turn variable and the argument unwind.
On Catastrophic Theorem Failure (Reforge)
If Unity is struck from the field, a count of five of the foe’s turns begins. This is the race to fix a
new axiom. Any term — Lemma, Corollary, even the Variable — must be moved to occupy the
opponent’s foundational constant (their Home Apex). This act reifies a fresh foundation.
Then Unity is redefined, by a most elegant trichotomy:
• Upon Their Constant. Audacious; balance the sum by cancelling one Variable you hold.
• Upon a Nodal Point (Sanctum). Stable; yet the node is fixed thereafter and may not
call a Variable again.
• Upon One’s Own Constant. Conservative; a return to first principles without fee.
32
Upon return, both operations of Unity are made fresh.
The Grand Strategy
Do not play the stones; play the coefficients and the exponents. Force thy foe to calculate while
thou merely observe. Let them spend integers while thou hoard primes. Let them litter the field
with variables while thou command the sum. Victory is not the capture; it is the final, elegant
simplification of the diamond into a single, inevitable, crystalline equilibrium.
I must go. The chalk calls. The angles are singing again. Q.E.D.

1.17 Ubral - The Uplander’s Counsel: A Ryme of the Stane-Game
(As spoken by the Laird Cormac of the Western Mists, and set doon by a faithful scribe.)
Translator’s note: Laird = Blue (Arbiter); Claim–Stake = Displacement; Hieland Leap = Hop;
Hearth–Bound = Rooted; Sacred Stanes = Sanctums; Cross = Central Four.
Hark, laddie, and list weel tae me,
If ye wad learn the game o’ the high countrie.
It is nae war o’ claymore and the cry,
But the quiet contest o’ the low’ring sky.
The Four Kin o’ the Board First, the Laird (Blue), wha holds the right o’ rule,
His is the name that lends the others their value.
Twa great rights he has: the Claim–Stake (s:D),
Tae displace a foe and seize his keep;
And the Hieland Leap (s:H), a benshie’s bound,
O’er a foe’s held ground, tae empty, sovereign land.
But hear this: spend baith rights in ae season’s span,
An’ the Laird is Hearth–Bound, a target for ilk man.
The Shepherds (Oranges), his right and left hand,
Their worth is nae in fight, but in command
O’ the lang glens and the wide, hazy parks,
They ward the flock and mark the landmarks.
The Cairns (Reds), the stanes that mind the deid,
They dinnae strike, they but hold the stead.
Ane is naething, a scatter o’ breeks,
But a line o’ them builds the wall that breaks.
The Hill–Runner (Green), the call o’ the mist,
A spirit summoned where the twa Sanctums tryst.
Nae a fighter, but a message, swift and clear,
A tale o’ alarm that the foe maun hear.
The Play o’ the Braes The Opening Step.
The second man moves twice, a gift o’ the fates;
Nae weakness, but a chance tae open twa gates.
Use ane tae show a strength upon the height,
An’ the ither tae hide a strength out o’ sight.
On the Unseen Hand.
Dinnae fight the fighter; fight the ground he stands on.
Mak his path a bog, his stride a stumble an’ a fa’.
A move spent answerin’ ye is a move ye didnae spend:
Ye’ve stolen the very breath frae his breast.
The Cross: The Fickle Ford.
The centre is a guid ford, but its waters rise fast.
A Laird may bide there three turns o’ his ain;
On the fourth, the spate comes, an’ he maun quit at last,
An’ for twa turns mair, that crossing stands in chain.
The Call o’ the Mist (Seed).
If yer Laird ends his step on the Sacred Stanes,
He may call a Runner frae the opposite air;
34
It gains ye a blade, but it tethers his veins—
He is Hearth–Bound, feasting, an’ vulnerable there.
But never on the first footfall frae hearth in a life,
Lest haste bring the mist an’ the mist bring strife.
Daur this when the foe’s Laird is lang away,
Or has spent his ain rights an’ cannae mak ye pay.
The Fa’, an’ the Five Chances (Reforge).
Should yer Laird be struck doon, the clan disnae flee.
Ye hae five o’ the foe’s turns tae set the wrang right:
Plant yer standard in his hame’s very lee,
In the heart o’ his fire, by craft or by might.
Then choose the hall for yer Laird’s return wi’ care:
Their Hame Hearth—bold grasp! but costs a Runner’s breath;
A Sanctum Stane—canny; yet that well runs dry thereafter;
Yer Ain Hearth—wise; nae tithe o’ seed, an’ life for after.
An’ when he hames again, his twa rights mend,
Fresh steel in hand, for byke or bend.
The Final Lesson Let them hae the centre; ye tak the high brae.
Let them win the battle; ye win the way hame.
Dinnae fight the man—fight the map he is readin’.
Walk wi’ the fog; let yer route arrive first.
Doctrine. Exploit the double-move; play the opponent, not the position. Typical lines.
Second-player double = lattice + probe; Cross denied by pre-built welds; tight ssi/xs bookkeeping
each turn.

1.18 The Black Banner Table (Articles & Primer)
Author: Captain Lathan “No-Colors” Bloodgoode, of the Crimson Quittance
Listen up, sell-sword. You’re not preaching honor or proving theorems. You’re buying wins. Play
the player, not the position. The board is a ledger of their fears and habits; the rules are tools.
Spend none twice.
I. Of the Double Step. Second to move is a lever, not a pity. Take two different pieces: one
to post a lattice, one to pry a seam. Deny the Cross by weld, apply pressure by probe. Tempo
is coin.
II. Of Ledgers and Exits. Enter the Cross only with certified exits (XS ≥1). Call no Seed
unless the Special Safety Index is sound (SSI ≥2: their Blue distant or its cuts already
spent).
III. Of the Royal Purse. The Blue bears two cuts: Displacement and Hop. Keep one in
reserve. Spend both in one life and you are Rooted till your next turn; do it only when your
second-special risk is cleared.
IV. Of Poison Wages. A “free” Blue is a noose if the banner graph is unsolved. Take it only
when you can plant under ZoC within ≤4 of your turns; else decline and finish the net.
V. Of the Sanctum Writ. Seed only if the opposite Sanctum is empty, the global Green
cap allows (G < 6), and the Rooted breath won’t cost the chest. No Seed on a Blue’s first
departure from Home in its life.
VI. Of Fences on Credit. Reds are paid to buy time. A Red that welds a penultimate square
is worth two breaths off the foe’s Reforge; spend it gladly.
VII. Of Receivership After a Fall. When you take their Blue, they have five of your turns
to plant a banner or lose. While the count runs, seal penults and tax lanes. If your Blue
falls, plant within five of their turns; on success, choose the return: their Home (sacrifice one
Green), a Sanctum (no future Seed there), or your Home (no cost).
VIII. Of Toll and Tax. Oranges are bailiffs. Post them so a foe entering ZoC must end their
march. A lane that stops men is a lane that pays.
IX. Of Couriers. Greens are couriers, not heroes. Run only on causeways printed two turns
before; never race a message through a blade.
X. Of Pageant and Ruse. Use the Cross as a timer, not a throne: three-stay, two-exile sets
the dial. Feints are lawful; theatrics are dear.
XI. Of Quittance. When neither side advances lane nor ledger, call the count. Under tournament
no-progress, accept the move-limit withdrawal like a professional.
XII. Of the Count at Table. Before each order, count exits, not victims. Whisper the five
clocks, the Green cap, and the cuts remaining. A captain who keeps the count keeps the field.
Typical Black-Banner start (as second):
• Double-Tongued Serpent: Orange onR 3 (probe) then Red onL 2 (anchor). Two attentions,
one ledger.
Table maxims:
36
• On tempo: “The double isn’t a bonus; it’s your first bill.”
• On specials: “Track their cuts like coin; empty purse, easy mark.”
• On Seeds: “A free Green isn’t; make sure they’re paying.”
• On wins: “Glory drinks for free. We don’t.”

2 Concordance: New Schools & Suppressed Fragments
Archivum Fragment— Marginalia in Aqyl of Thepyrgos’s hand, from a suppressed folio of the Corpus
Canré.
Provenance. Recovered by Aqyl not in an archive but in the Lyceum bindery at Thepyrgos: a single folio
used as binder’s waste—a pastedown leaf inside an Aeler ledger (“Schedules of Tithe on Canal Stone, 3rd
Lavius”). The sheet bore an Ecktorian customs docket, ash along the fore-edge, and the Office of Customs’
knotted ribbon still glued to the fold. Aqyl lifted it during rebinding, recognized the tally of “game-boxes, jet
& pearl,” and kept the copy that now circulates. He later wrote that this scrap, pulled from glue and linen,
first convinced him the Game was older—and wider—than the Empire.
Aqyl of Thepyrgos, marginal note15:
Fragment 79–Gamma: On the Proliferation of the Imperial Game in Foreign Parts16
...which led me to the cargo manifests of the Sea–Scribe, out of Silkstrand. Among
the bolts of cyan silk and casks of violet ink were listed three (3) crates of “game–
boxes, pieces of carved jet and pearl, with board.” The bill of lading, certified by a
harbor–master in that den of scoundrels, named not a noble house nor an academy,
but a Vilikari factor in the Western Marches.
A Vilikari. A peddler–king. In possession of the Imperial Game.
The indignity of it curdled my stomach. I assumed trade—some bauble for a savage
chieftain aping his betters. Then came the report from Lieutenant Decimus at Kharax:
a prisoner’s testimony that the Ykrul captains wager upon something they call Kon’reh.
He described the diamond board. The blue stone. The orange.
Coincidence, I thought. A barbarian imitation.
But the pieces fell into place. Dhaharan caravan guards with polished camel–bone sets
in the serai; Aeler factors settling disputes not with dice but with a quiet game on slate
in their under–vaults, which they call K’thra. The terms differ; the habits rhyme.
I confronted Magistrate Bollus. I showed him the manifests; the testimony. “Sir,” I
said, “there is a leakage. Our imperial art is being...vulgarized.”
He did not look up. “It is good for trade,” he said. “They pay well for boxes. Tithes
accrue. File as cultural exports.”
He did not understand. Exports are wine, silk, law. This is different. These are not
imitations. The rules—so far as these fragments allow—are the same. The ZoC. The
Sanctums. The Reforge.
The rules are the same.
15Aqyl writes: “Smuggled copy, provenance uncertain; likely mid–late imperial. My transcript was subsequently
‘reclaimed’ by a clerk and has not reappeared. I preserve here the text as I recall it, with one smudged leaf.”
16Archivist’s rubric (in vermilion): “On foreign profanations.” Hand unidentified; diction suggests a trained imperial
scribe.
38
This cannot be recent diffusion. The Ykrul host has its own terms, strategies, masters.
Such depth does not bloom in a season; it roots over centuries.
A terrible, treasonous thought seized me:
What if we did not perfect it?
What if we only codified one channel of a river far older—and far wider—than the
Empire?
If the Imperial Game is not solely ours, then what is? Our law? Our language? Our
very identity?
I shall cease. It is not safe. I will file the manifests and burn the lieutenant’s report.
The Empire must stand upon firm ground, not on the shifting sands of a thousand
foreign boards...
Aqyl’s postscript. The folio breaks just as the clerk begins to list our cognate
customs—the guest’s double–courtesy (second player’s double–move), the twin wells
(our Sanctums), the five–breath race (Reforge). This scrap did not close an argument;
it opened a road. I copied what I could before the docket was reclaimed, then spent six
years chasing teak boards, skin–mats, and under–vault slates to test the claim. Let the
note stand: Canré / Canray appears older and wider than any one house may know.
Our Ecktorian channel is handsome; it is not the source. If the Thepyrgosi refined it
toward pristine logic, that too is only a claim—as ever, the board must decide.
39
2.1 Oshiiran School (Canray)
Doctrine. Logistics wins; throughput over shock. Build escorted corridors, rotate screens, and
move the convoy—not just a single runner.
Typical lines. “Convoy Lane” (Green courier paired with a trailing Orange, Reds welding
penultimates); “Twin Depots” (clear both Sanctums, then Seed on schedule); Cross used as a
checkpoint to flip lanes—never a camp.
Seed timing. Only into a secured opposite Sanctum: SSI ≥1 and a “spare cart” (an Orange
within hm 2 of either Sanctum) to cover Rooted.
Reforge preference. Home by default (reset the column); Sanctum if the convoy is already
across mid-board; Apex almost never.
Piece roles. Blue = Marshal (route master); Oranges = Quartermasters (escort/forks); Reds =
Pickets (welds); Greens = Couriers.
Heuristics.
• Throughput Index (TP). Count guaranteed safe convoy steps in the next two plies; push
only at TP ≥3.
• Spare Cart Rule. Never launch a Seed or banner run with your last Orange out of cover
range.
• Two-Port Rule. Don’t Seed until both Sanctums are accessible or held.
Opening tag. Caravan Gate: Red on 2, Red hm 1, Orange on 3 (mid-ring post to anchor the
lane).
Maxim. “Feed the lane; the lane feeds the win.”
Lore caption. Manifests stamped at dawn; quartermasters tap brass tallies; the convoy rolls on
time and the board—like the road—obeys.
40
2.2 Ashaani School (Canray)
Doctrine. Tribute and terror. Offer the board a veil (a visible threat) while the knife (the real
lane) moves in shadow. Sacrifice is a currency; despair is a tool.
Typical lines. “Veil & Knife” (telegraph a Cross touch while the opposite ring is welded for
a Green sprint); “Tribute Ladder” (trade a low Red to pull screens, then fork with Orange two
plies later); Cross used as a balcony—brief strike with certified exits (XS), never a camp.
Seed timing. Predatory. Goad the opponent into an unsafe Seed (Rooted punish ready); your
own Seed only when SSI ≥1 and a Black Hand screen (an Orange within hm 2) covers the
Rooted turn.
Reforge preference. Sanctum for continuous pressure; Apex as a coup de théâtre on dispersed
boards; Home only to reset after a failed knife.
Piece roles. Blue = Mask-Bearer (stage manager); Oranges = Knifemen (enforcers/forks);
Reds = Petitioners (placed and spent); Greens = Tribute (ran when the crowd looks elsewhere).
Heuristics.
• Veil Count (VC). Keep two simultaneous stories on the board: one to draw screens, one
to score. If VC= 1, you are playing honest—and Ashaan does not.
• Tithe Margin (TM). (your Greens)−(lanes you must defend). Push trades only at TM
≥1; below that, you are bleeding.
• Knife Window (KW). Launch a Cross hit only if XS ≥1 and a follow-up fork lands in
≤2 plies; without the fork, the balcony is just light.
Opening tag. Coin-Veil: Red on 2, Orange on 3 (center feint), second Red hm 1 (quiet weld
on the true file).
Maxim. “Show them the veil; take them with the knife.”
Lore caption. Coin-veil clinks in the colonnade; incense drowns the truth; somewhere offstage a
Black Hand chord is plucked—and a lane no one watched becomes the only way left.
41
2.3 Dhaharan School (Canray)
Doctrine. Court of the road. Treat files as caravan lanes, ZoC as toll and escort. Win by
adjudication: make the profitable path yours and price the others into surrender.
Typical lines. “Twin Wells” (early Sanctum pivots that mirror hospitality rites; Seed only when
the guest cannot punish), “Customs Knot” (post a Red on each penultimate, then slide an Orange
to adjudicate the only legal exit), Cross used as dais: a one-turn appearance to read the board,
never a camp.
Seed timing. Cautious and ceremonial. Seed when the guest courtesy (their saved Blue
special) is undeniably spent—SSI ≥2 or distance ≥2 plies. Sanctums are “wells”: never raise a
depot under spears.
Reforge preference. Home to reset escorts; Sanctum when it re-opens the profitable lane;
Apex only if the board is dispersed and a tithe (Green) is worth the public lesson.
Piece roles. Blue = Court-Speaker (announces rulings, spends cuts sparingly), Oranges =
Assessors (set prices/forks), Reds = Tithe-Posts (quiet stoppers), Greens = Licenses (the only
traffic that truly moves value).
Heuristics.
• Courtesy Ledger (CL). Count their Blue specials as courtesies owed. Seed into CL= 0;
deny until it is.
• Lane Rent (LR). A file is yours if you can name two ZoC end-squares on its last three
steps. Raise rent there; abandon the rest.
• Dais Rule (DR). Cross touch at most once per cycle: enter with XS≥1, exit to a Sanctum
or stopper; never return before two full turns.
Opening tag. Saffron Gate: Red on 2 (inner post), Orange on 3 (market probe), second Red
hm 1 (rear stopper). The lane looks open—but pays before it passes.
Maxim. “Hospitality first, then the price.”
Lore caption. Saffron rope across a caravan court; water-marks chalked by the well. Two escorts
step aside in courtesy—then close behind, and the profitable road is the only road left.
42
2.4 Kahfagian (Corsair Canray)
Scene. Lanterns wink along a ragged quay; pilots call soundings with knotted lines while a
narrow-keel cutter noses past shallows no chart admits. By dawn the beacons have moved—and
so has the tax.
Who they are. Breakwater princes and estuary pilots of the western littorals; a schooled corsair
culture that learned its law under Oshiiran ledgers17 and unlearned it under their own flags. They
read water the way accountants read margins: currents, back-eddies, and the price of a wrong
tide.
Doctrine — “Sail the tide you set.” They make position with decoys and channels rather
than force: a false beacon here, a dredged shoal there, until the only safe water is the lane they
sell you. Sanctums are town harbors, not altars; the Central Four is open sea—crossed swiftly
under a fair wind, never camped. They prize leverage earned before contact: the neat humiliation
where the enemy arrives intact and still cannot enter.
Table names (in-world slang). Flagship (Blue), Pilots (Oranges), Moorings (Reds), Cutters
(Greens). Zones of Control (ZoC) are shoals; ring squares are the shoreline. To “move the
lanterns” is to reframe a lane without touching the foe (ZoC shifts, opposite-Sanctum denial).
Style in brief. Edge onset from the “lee” side, then a sudden tack across the center while
the lights change. They prefer a clean board with long coasts to cluttered melee; their proudest
victories end with nothing sunk—only turned away by charts the other side didn’t know were
being drawn.
Match temperaments. They salt the nets of heavy Ykrul and Viterran—too many inlets to
fence—and slip past Ecktorian parity by shifting the channel after the survey’s done. They are
wary of pure Vilikari storm-raids (a gale ignores charts) and of Lethai single-stroke calm: both
punish a lantern moved one heartbeat late.
Custom of the coast. A Kahfagian captain will offer parley once, with wine and figs, and show
you the safe line. If you refuse, the lights change. No curses; only water, and the knowledge that
you read it wrong.
“Set your beacon on truth, not bravado; then let the tide do the arguing.” — Admiral Saref of the
Red Shoal
17If not defined elsewhere: Oshiiran—river-accountancy city-states that codified coastal tariffs.

Sidebar — Saabir al–Fhara: On the Toll of Mirages
Rendered into Kántos by Aqyl of Thepyrgos from the Diw¯an of the Way of Three
Wells, folios 47–49; Fenwood Concordance, shelf R/amber.
A lane is not distance; it is thirst priced. We sell shade at noon and wind at dusk; by
dawn they will swear the desert owed us both. Post your orange toll where feet must
fall, and the proud will pay with time rather than coin. Time spends dearer.
Touch the market once, then ride. Put your flag to the four–stone middle, count
the two exits that must be, and leave your lantern burning in their eyes while you
are already gone along the ring. A sheikh who lingers at the square writes her own
encirclement.
On mirages. Keep two lanes that seem open and end one step short in your shadow;
do not harvest them, price them. Let the thirsty walk to your measure and call it
choice. When the tax is habit, the desert will collect for you.
On oases. A depot raised far is a promise and a trap for the impatient. Seed only
when there are two retreats—one for the sheikh and one for the courier— and when
the stranger’s champion has already spent his suddenness. A miracle shown to a
skeptic is a lesson taught against yourself.
On banners. Five dawns decide a caravan’s fate. Weld the penultimate stone on both
roads and the rebel will arrive to find only your receipt. Spend a red to save a day;
spend a day to buy the journey.
Remember: we are not a storm. We are a price. Leave them a way and make it ours.
44
Fhara School (Way of Silk Qôn’r¯ e)
Doctrine. Trade the lane you raid. Offer a price where feet must fall, then change the price
mid-stride. Never hold ground you can keep moving.
Typical lines. Touch-and-tithe the Cross (one turn) →pivot to a Sanctum clamp; “shadow-
caravan” mirroring—trail an enemy lane at one remove and skim tempo with Oranges; sudden
lane-swap via ring squares when defenders overcommit.
Seed timing. Oasis Window: Seed only when two retreats exist (one for Blue, one for the new
Green) and the enemy Blue has no immediate special in range. Prefer Seeds that also flip tolls
on the opposite edge.
Reforge preference. Sanctum for rolling pressure; Opposing Apex only on dispersed boards
after a successful tithe run.
Piece roles. Reds = cairn-marks that make enemies step short; Oranges = toll-keepers that
move the price; Blue = caravan sheikh (raids, then vanishes); Greens = couriers that announce
the next market by arriving first.
Table heuristics.
• Mirage Count (MC): how many lanes appear open but end in your ZoC one step short; play
raids at MC ≥2.
• Tithe Rate (TR): across a 3-turn sequence, how many opposing plies convert to “paying”
(ending in ZoC or forced reroute)? TR = 2 is sustainable profit.
• Oasis Window (OW): Seed only if Blue keeps a legal, non-ZoC end square and the spawned
Green has a two-ply escape.
Epigraph. “Sell them shade at noon and wind at dusk; by dawn they will swear the desert owed
you both.” — Safiya al-Fhara
45
2.5 Ostrikari School (Storm-Seed Raid)
“Strike the Sanctum like a storm and count to five by footsteps, not heartbeats; if
they still bear a banner when you finish, you counted wrong.”
— Kara Red-Hollow, Ostrikari raid-mother
Doctrine. Throw the storm, not the shield. Escort a Seed under fire, spike the Green count,
then trade Blues only when your kill-grid is set. Deny both banner lanes and ride down the
five-count.
Typical lines. P2 muster screen (e.g., Red onL 2 + Orange onR 3) →Blue approaches Sanctum
→Seed to opposite Sanctum (if empty; cap < 6) [Rooted] →Green hmR 3 (fork) + Red onL 2
(stopper) →Blue [S:D] capture; RC 1/5 for foe →two-lane clamp with Orange posts and Red
penultimate stoppers. Ring-step pivots punish overcommits.
Seed timing. Warband Gate: Seed only with SSI ≥1 (their Blue cannot hit Rooted next ply),
never on the Blue’s first departure from Home (mobilization delay), and only when both escapes
exist: a legal, non-ZoC end for Blue on lift, and a two-ply exit for the spawned Green. Prefer
Seeds that also flip a key lane node.
Reforge preference. Impose RC: capture once your grid already denies the two fastest banner
paths. If you must Reforge, favor Sanctum re-entry when the warband remains intact; choose
Opposing Apex only on dispersed boards where screens are pre-posted.
Piece roles. Reds= axemen (penultimate stoppers, end-square cairns); Oranges= raiders (lane
sprints, choke posts); Blue= war-chief (hold one special for the flip—[S:D] preferred); Greens=
shieldwall (mesh ZoC, banner clamps).
Table heuristics.
• Seed Safety Index (SSI): {0, 1, 2}—minimum plies before their Blue (with a held special) can
legally hit Rooted. Commit only at SSI ≥1; prefer 2.
• Clamp Pair (CP): how many enemy banner lanes you can fully deny by your next ply
(end-squares or penultimates sealed). Trade Blues when CP ≥2.
• Kill-Grid Depth (KGD): longest consecutive chain of lane nodes on their primary banner path
that are occupied or ZoC-ending. Aim KGD = 2 on the capture ply, 3 by RC 3/5.

2.6 Fieldcraft School (Hedge & Loaf)
“What they play in hedges and gutters is not Canré but ditchwork: a fenced lane,
a tithe at the shrine, a banner planted without a proof. Edible as a crustless loaf,
yes—yet unworthy of the table.”
— Aqyl of the Silk Colleges, marginalia in On Proper Canré
Doctrine. Lay the hedge, bake the bread. Win lanes with cheap, sure moves; bank a breath early
to own the last move on the banner file. Touch the Cross only to tax; spend specials once, at the
door.
Typical lines. Homeward scaffold: Red onL 2 →Red hmR 1 (flip parity on the target lane)
→Orange onR 3 post; brief lantern toll [CF: in 1/3] with two exits named →leave; Blue to
Sanctum only when screens are set; S:D reserved to make/break the penultimate weld; ring-step
pivot if the choke shifts.
Seed timing. Hearth Window: Seed only when SSI ≥1 (their Blue cannot legally hit Rooted
next ply), Mobilization is cleared (not the first departure), and both escapes exist: a legal, non-ZoC
end for Blue on lift, and a two-ply exit for the spawned Green. Prefer Seeds that deepen the
hedge (extend R/O screens or flip a toll one square forward).
Reforge preference. Home after capture—trust the road you built; choose Opposing Apex
only when an existing clamp shortens your runner’s path by ≥1 and keeps their two fastest lanes
taxed.
Piece roles. Reds= fenceposts (penultimate stoppers, cairn-marks); Oranges= gates (price-
setters that move the toll); Blue= road-warden (proves exits, escorts, rarely brawls); Greens=
runners (one courier, not a swarm).
Table heuristics.
• Parity Reserve (PR): homeward ticks you own on the banner lane (your HML/HMR minus
theirs). Spend S:D only when PR ≥1 so the weld lands on your schedule.
• Hedge Depth (HD): longest contiguous chain of R/O posts that shield the runner on the
banner path. Aim HD = 2 before Seed; 3 by RC 3/5.
• Seed Safety Index (SSI): {0, 1, 2}—minimum plies before their Blue (with a held special) can
legally hit Rooted. Commit only at SSI ≥1; prefer 2.
• Exit Certainty (XS): name two legal exits before any Cross touch or capture; if you can’t
name them, you don’t have them.

2.7 The Cartwright School (Haíresis Kántou)
Doctrine. Break the mirror, win the clocks. Trade shape for time and force the game into
out-of-phase timers (Cross stay/exile, specials, Reforge). The board may look equal; the schedule
will not.
Typical lines. “Loose Mirror” (shadow their structure, then slide a Red hm 1 to desync stays);
“Lantern Out, Lantern In” (brief Cross touch, immediate exit to start exile while theirs remains
unused); “Borrowed Knife” (invite a Blue special on a low-value plug to buy SSI; pivot to Seed
one beat later). Cross is a lantern, not a camp.
Seed timing. Opportunistic, post-offset. Seed into their exile window or after you’ve pulled a
punish cut—SSI ≥1 minimum, ≥2 preferred. Sanctum is a time lever, not a depot.
Reforge preference. Sanctum if it shortens their banner by ≥1 ply or preserves the offset;
Home when down on clocks and you need a clean reset; Opposing Apex only on a thin board
with a certified exit (XS ≥1) and VC < 2.
Piece roles. Blue = Questioner (spends a cut to change chapters, not counts); Oranges =
Metronomes (set the beat; post forks that cost time); Reds = Props (small slides that bend
schedules); Greens = Runners (cash the time lead).
Heuristics.
• Clock Offset (CO). Keep Cross stay/exile out of phase: your exile served while theirs starts.
• Mirror Debt (MD). Each time they restore symmetry, book them +1 ply; spend that tempo
elsewhere.
• Exit Certainty (XS). Touch Cross only at XS ≥1 (playable), ≥2 (safe).
• Vantage Count (VC). If returning/Rooting would yield VC ≥2, you’re volunteering a
capture. Don’t.
• Cap Clock (CCA). Push to cap = 6 when ahead; stall when behind to keep your Seed
window live.
Opening tag. Wheelwright Break: Red hm 1 (loose mirror), Orange onR 3 (fork tempo), Blue
on 5 touch →immediate hm 4 exit. Picture stays equal; timers do not.
Maxim. “Don’t prove the position—win the schedule.”

2.8 Rothari’s Scorched Earth (Acasi Warlord)
Doctrine. If you cannot hold it, make it worthless. Trade material for ruin: burn exits, salt
wells (Sanctums), and force the enemy to re-enter a map that no longer pays. Win by famine—of
lanes, of specials, of Greens.
Typical lines.
• Sack & Salt: threaten a Cross poke only to pivot and weld ring files; when Blue is chased,
you leave their penultimates “burned” (ZoC overlays that turn every legal end into payment).
• Empty Granary: delay Seed while you peel one enemy Green; then force cap = 6 on your
count—deny production and prosecute Reforge.
• Torchline: spend a Red to open a single capture that removes two enemy exits (pull the
stopper, not the prize); post an Orange one file over to make all “repairs” end in ZoC.
• Tribute Net: mark both penultimates to their Home with cheap Reds, then patrol with Blue
for displacement-only trades that keep their runner one ply short.
Seed timing. Seed as a blockade, not a flourish. Preferred windows: (i) SSI ≥2 after you’ve
raised ring taxes with Oranges, (ii) immediately after peeling a Green to push cap toward 6 on
your count. Seeds that don’t worsen their future Reforge are vanity.
Reforge preference. Home to reset the patrol on a dense board; Sanctum only when the
same-Sanctum ban converts that well into a permanent dead port for the rest of that Blue’s life;
Opposing Apex rarely—only on stripped maps where a single displacement ends banners.
Piece roles. Blue= Warlord: spends one special early to “torch” a keystone, keeps the second
to police banners; Oranges= Taxmen: set lasting ZoC tolls on ring files; Reds= Raze–posts:
cheap stoppers you’ll gladly trade to darken a corridor; Greens= Scouts: run only when the
famine count favors you.

2 ). Force cap =
Table heuristics.
• Famine Index (FI): (your Greens−theirs) + (you hit cap first? + 1
2 :−
6 when FI ≥1, then trade a Green off the board.
• Ruin Map (RM): number of their lanes where a single pull (capture/slide) drops XS by ≥2
within two plies. Play to raise RM; strike at RM ≥2.
• Ash Rate (AR): net pieces removed per three of your turns that also reduce their future
Seed/Exit quality. AR > 0 means the map is getting worse—good.
• Sanctum Value (SV): +1 if a Sanctum return would ban their future Seed there (via Reforge
choice pressure); +1 if your Seed now sets a lasting toll; Seed at SV ≥1 and SSI ≥1.
Opening tag. Broken Tithe: Red on the inner ring (penultimate stopper), Orange onR 3 to tax
the opposite file, second Red hm 1 to anchor a future pull. The lane is “open,” but every end
pays.
Maxim. “Leave them a road they cannot afford.”

3 Rekedim’s Field Manual: Canray by Convoy
I write this for those who must win on bad roads. If you want cheers, juggle knives at
Silkstrand. If you want your people home, read on. — Sergeant Rekedim Many-Scars
3.1 I. Tenets (Pin these to your board)
1. Count to Five. Every plan is a Reforge plan. If capturing their Blue today cannot be held
for five of their turns, it is a trap for you.
2. Own the Ring. Ring squares win more games than the Central Four. The Four is a lever;
the ring is the road.
3. Two-Ply Welds. One Red to close a file, one Orange to print a fork two plies ahead. Do
this twice and a runner drowns.
4. Seed is a Depot, Not a Daring. Seed only when the SSI is safe. A Rooted Blue is a
burned wagon if their royal still has a cut.
5. Exits Before Enemies. ZoC is a blade that cuts on their turn. Count exits; spend
captures only where exits survive.
6. Respect Stagger. Crown Stagger roots a Blue that just spent its second special. If that
Blue is yours, you planned badly; if it is theirs, you planned well.
3.2 II. March Order (Openings that don’t lose)
1. First: Back Bridge. Red hm 1. Quiet anchor, future weld.
2. Second (their double): Expect probe + prop (anchor). Do not answer speed with speed;
answer with shape.
3. Third: Second Back Bridge. Red hm 1. Mirror anchor; ring control begins.
4. Blue Mobilization. Move Blue once off Home early, but remember Mobilization delay:
you cannot Seed on that first departure. Plan your second Sanctum touch to align with
SSI ≥2.
5. Central Four Touches. Enter only when XS ≥1, exit mapped, and you are trading
time for lanes, not for applause.
3.3 III. Heuristics (Soldier’s Numbers)
SSI — Seed Safety Index. Seed only if enemy Blue is two plies away and out of specials.
Borderline case (distance ≥2, specials = 1): screen with both a Red and an Orange.
XS — Exit Certainty. Before you hit inside the Four, count exits that cannot be ZoC-sealed
over their next two plies. If XS = 0, you’re volunteering for a funeral.
CCA — Cap Clock Advantage. (Your Greens−theirs) + 1
2 if you can hit the global
cap first. If ahead, consider forcing cap 6 before an exchange to choke their Reforge options.
3.4 IV. Contact Drills (What to do when you meet resistance)
Drill 1: Rooted Trap. Opponent Seeds with Blue Rooted on Sanctum. If they have a
special left and are in range next ply, that was bait. Punish. If not, occupy the opposite Sanctum
to deny their follow-up.
51
Drill 2: Cross Raid Denial. After a hop or displacement inside the Four, your reply is
not a chase—it’s a weld. Red to the penultimate of the nearest banner lane; Orange two plies
ahead to fork the re-route.
Drill 3: Cap Squeeze. At Greens 3–2 in your favor, stall Seeds until you can peel one
enemy Green; then press to cap 6 and trade Blues. They will suffocate in Reforge.
3.5 V. Reforge Protocol (When Blues fall)
If you captured their Blue. Now the real game starts.
1. Identify Two Lanes. Name the two shortest banner lanes aloud. Aim to weld both with
a Red (penultimate) and an Orange (fork ahead).
2. Spend Specials as Pliers. Your Blue’s fresh displacement is for removing the single
stopper that reopens both lanes. Burn it once; don’t get cute.
3. Trade Down Greens. A single hop to prune a runner is worth three Reds here. After
[G:2–0], the clock wins for you.
If they captured your Blue. Five turns is not panic—it’s a budget.
1. Name Your Runner & Route. Pick the fastest banner path; do not split your spend
unless forced.
2. Clear the Penultimate. If you saw it coming the prior turn, you should already have used
your Blue to remove exactly one stopper; otherwise lead with Green, screen with Orange.
3. Placement Discipline. If you plant: Home if density is high; Sanctum only if it shortens
their next banner by at least one ply; Opposing Apex is for bards and funerals.
3.6 Pre-Seed.
VI. Checklists (Say them before you move)
• Mobilization delay satisfied? (Not the first Blue departure.)
• Opposite Sanctum empty? Cap < 6?
• SSI ≥2? Screens ready?
Cross Entry.
• XS ≥1 next ply? Exclusion plan after exit?
• Are you buying lanes, not likes?
Blue Capture.
• Can you deny two shortest banners in ≤2 plies?
• If not, you didn’t catch a Blue—you stepped in a noose.
52
3.7 VII. On Specials & Stagger (Use the knife like a tool)
• One special per Blue turn. Slide then special is legal; special then slide is not.
• Crown Stagger. If a Blue spends both cuts in the same life (one Hop, one Displacement),
it roots at end of that turn. Plan to be adjacent when theirs staggers; plan to not be when
yours does.
• Spend for Geometry. A good special removes a stopper that reopens two roads. A bad
one harvests applause.
3.8 VIII. Errors I Keep Seeing (Stop doing these)
• Seeding into a saved cut. Your Blue was not a depot; it was bait.
• Cross camping. The Four has a fuse (three of your turns). Use it to pivot, not to pose.
• Hero reforges. Dropping on their Apex trades a Green to die stylishly. Count density,
not courage.
3.9 IX. Three Field Lessons (Memorize)
1. The Quiet Win. We closed two lanes with Reds, pruned one Green, and never touched
the Four. Their Reforge ended one step short. No songs were sung. Everyone slept under canvas.
That is victory.
2. The Bad Seed. A recruit Seeded on his first Blue departure, proud as a rooster. Their
Blue had a hop in pocket and the range. We bought him a marker and rewrote the checklist bigger.
3. The Stagger Catch. Their Blue spent hop in the Four and displacement to break a
file. We had posted an Orange two squares off. Stagger rooted them next end. The capture was
paperwork.
3.10 X. Drills (Fifteen minutes a night)
• Two-Ply Weld Ladder. Defender gets two moves after a Cross hit: one Red weld, one
Orange fork. Swap until the attacker stops finding exits.
• SSI Reps. Place Blue on Sanctum; vary enemy range (distance = 1, 2, 3) and specials
(= 0, 1, 2). Log which Seeds lived.
• Cap Sprints. Start [G:3–2]. One side forces cap 6 before a Blue trade; the other peels a
Green first. Swap.
Final: Move for their fifth step, not today’s cheer. Close roads, not men. If you must
bleed, bleed on a number that was already winning.

Embassy Dispatch, Ykrul–Dhaharan Parley (translator’s hand).
He unveiled an “original” board... nine by nine: river-lapis set in walnut, its ninth
ranks titled for saints. Our Warlord (aveth)18 stepped forward, touched the outer file
as if to bless, and spat upon the ninth. Gasps; hands half-raised to hilts.
I bowed and spoke in both tongues: “Not insult... warding. Salt upon a false ninth
to keep the game clean.” Then I set down our board: eight by eight, horse-leather
stretched on a travel frame, corners fire-marked, lanes scored by knife. The Warlord
placed a blue stone with a rider’s thud. I softened their words for peace: “Count
breaths, not baubles. Play on Eight, or do not play.”
The envoy’s smile wavered. It was a severe misstep... to arrive with a ninth is to
revise at the temple door. Tonight I will unknot what he tied: we’ll send him off with
the leather as a gift, call the spittle sanctification, and offer a teaching game at Eight.
If I succeed, tomorrow we will speak of grain and river-rights instead of saints and
squares. If I fail, the parley will end at the board before it ever reaches the table.
aveth (Ykrul, adj./n.): “unpaired; outside the dyad.” Morphology: a- (privative) + veth “pair/twin.”

4 Saikou’s Case Notes: Canré of the Fogbound
I don’t win by being faster. I win because you walk where the story told you to. —
Detective Saikou Ira
4.1 I. Operating Assumptions (read before you set a piece)
1. The board is a crime scene. Incentives are fingerprints. Do not ask what they threaten;
ask why they want you to see it.
2. Every threat tells a story. Offer two stories at once and resolve the third.
3. ZoC is fog. It hides routes as much as it blocks them. Park noise in their eyeline; move
truth one file away.
4. The Central Four is a lantern. Touch it to cast shadows on the ring; leave before the
crowd gathers.
5. Reforge is cover. Five of their turns is either a siren or a smoke bomb. Choose which.
4.2 II. Quiet Rules (house style of the Fogbound)
1. Hide the reason, not the piece. Show Blue; conceal why Blue moved.
2. Offer a good exchange you do not want. Bait their best reply; prepare the file where
that reply fails.
3. Two squares ahead, one square aside. Your useful move is usually the hm drift that
makes their best onward end in ZoC.
18Duke Fenwood, marginalia. Scribes keep writing “neutral,” which misses the saddle. Aveth is not a lack but a
stance: untwinned. The Ykrul count by eights and pairs; an aveth stands on a single wind, owing title to none of the
dyads. If you must have one word in the common tongue, take “untwinned,” and be done.
54
4. Spend your special to change the story, not the count. A captured Orange is
applause; a re-routed Green is a chapter break.
5. Never camp a lantern. The CF stay limit is a timer on spectacle. Enter with XS ≥1;
exit with a Sanctum pivot.
6. Respect Stagger. If they are about to stagger (second special), be adjacent next turn. If
you are, be nowhere a ledger can find.
4.3 III. Tools of Fog (techniques, not tricks)
Two Lanterns. Telegraph a Cross raid and a same-side Sanctum; execute the opposite
Sanctum Seed after a hm drift.
Stage: Blue on 5 (Four) [CF:in 1/3] →hm 4 exit threatening near Sanctum; next turn hm 2
onto far Sanctum →Seed. SSI ≥2 preferred; ≥1 only with two independent screens.
Borrowed Knife. Seed or XS to touch-and-go in the Four.
Invite a Blue special on a low-value plug; their [S:spent] buys you SSI to
Paper Wall. Park a Red where it looks like a stopper but only guards penultimate; the real
weld is one file over. Opponents waste a ply “reopening” a lane that was never closed.
Phantom Sanctum. Occupy the opposite Sanctum with an Orange when they Rooted-Seed.
Do not capture; deny their next Seed and keep the story gray.
Shadow Ledger. Nudge the Green cap by one, then refuse every trade that would equalize.
Aim is not more Greens, but fewer on the board when the count matters.
4.4 IV. Openings that read like something else
Empty Street (vs. Control). Red hm 1; Red hm 1; Blue on 5 (brief Four touch) [CF:in
1/3] →hm 4 exit to ring. The “attack” is the price you paid to rotate their lattice; the real work
is the ring posts you placed.
Lantern and Ledger (vs. Parity). Threaten symmetry, then sell it. Mirror once; hm
drift Blue to a Sanctum you will not Seed from; occupy opposite Sanctum with Orange; Seed only
after they commit a lemma to the wrong file.
Market Day (vs. Tempo). Show three stalls: a Cross poke, a Sanctum hint, a Green step.
Close one, sell one, keep one. Let them buy the wrong hour and run into ZoC ends.
4.5 V. Heuristics (Saikou’s counts)
SSI — Seed Safety Index. Seed only if enemy Blue is two plies away and out of specials.
Borderline case (distance ≥2, specials = 1): use two independent screens.
XS — Exit Certainty. a wake.
Inside the Four, count exits they cannot seal in two plies; if 0, it is
VC — Vantage Count. How many enemy pieces can end on your Blue’s square if you
Rooted it next ply? If VC ≥2, the Seed is a confession.
NP — Narrative Pressure. How many “obvious” replies does your last move advertise?
If the number is one, you are being read.
55
4.6 VI. Match Notes (read the person, not the banner)
Ykrul (Control). They count exits. Give them exits that go nowhere; weld two files after
they rotate to close the wrong one.
Thepyrgosi (Parity). They do not take bait; make the bait a proof. Force a mirror that
concedes a single ply on a banner file; win by inevitability they authored.
Vilikari (Tempo). Let them juggle. Touch Four once to make noise; post two quiet Reds
and an Orange fork where their double-move ends.
Lethai (Single-Stroke). Do not chase the pond. Mud it: add low-value trades that blur
their single stroke into three small ones.
4.7 VII. Reforge as cover
When you capture Blue. Build a false fastest lane. Your visible weld is the decoy; the
real end-square is a file deeper. Their countdown burns on the wrong road.
When they capture your Blue. One runner, one rumor. The rumor is an Orange
sprint into a ZoC wall; the runner is a Green you never mentioned. Placement: Home unless a
Sanctum return shortens their next banner by ≥1 ply.
4.8 VIII. Specials and Stagger (stagecraft, not heroics)
• One special per Blue turn. Slide then special is legal; special then slide is not.
• Crown Stagger. If a Blue spends its second special this life, it Roots at end of that turn.
Set the appointment; be on the square next scene.
• Spend to edit the map. A good Hop removes a stopper that changes two chapters. If
you harvested applause, you paid too much.
4.9 IX. Drills (fog in the hands, not the head)
Sanctum Mirage. Place Blue on Sanctum with SSI borderline (S=1, R=2). Practice hm
drifts that turn their punish into a miss and your Seed into a bookend.
Blind Exit Count. Opponent announces a Four hit; you have two plies to create XS = 0
for them. Log which weld + fork pairs work on an open board.
Stagger Trap. Script a sequence where they must spend Hop now and Displacement next.
Be adjacent for the root. Repeat until it feels scheduled, not lucky.
Final: If they moved because they understood, you are losing. If they moved because
they had to, you are home.
56
5 Advanced Knots of the Five-Breath Weave
War-Sage Khel of the River Steppe:
“You learned to tie five knotsn of thn Weave? Good. Now bind the calendar. Do not
chase his stones—schedule them. These knots are not tricks; they are appointments
you set in breath and lane.”
Knot I — Twin Lids (the Sluice Shut)
Aim. Deny both shortest banners the moment you offer him the Blue.
Count. Name his two fastest routes by their penultimate squares.
Lay. Over prior turns, post an Orange one step off each penultimate (lids), and
print a Red throat toward the Cross. Now show a poison square: place your Blue
where his Displacement looks clean. If he takes, the five-breath march runs into
double lids and drowns; if he refuses, your lids already weld his exits for the next
season.
Knot II — The Borrowed Banner
Aim. Sell him your Blue only when his Reforge is already dead.
Test. Can you make both named lanes XS=0 in ≤two of your plies after capture? If
not, do not sell. If yes, offer.
Cadence (legal). After he captures:
1. Your next turn: place a Red on lane A’s penultimate (weld).
2. His turn: his runner must advance or waste a breath into ZoC.
3. Your following turn: advance an Orange two along lane B (fork the re-route).
No double-moves here—just paperwork on two of your plies. If the lanes were named
right, his RC burns on the wrong road.
Knot III — The Stagger Appointment
Aim. Root his royal exactly when you are already adjacent.
Set. Invite his first cut on a low piece near the ring; on your next ply, threaten a
file so that his only tidy reply is the other cut. One special per Blue turn: when he
spends the second, Crown-Stagger nails him at end of that turn. Be on the neighbor
square already; next breath, take the loan of five (capture) or pen him to drown.
Knot IV — The Quiet Seed Denial
Aim. Turn his Rooted gain into famine.
When he Seeds: if your SSI was sound, do not rush the Rooted Blue. Occupy the
opposite Sanctum with Orange (legal: non-Blues may stand on Sanctums) to close
the depot, and weld a Red on the nearest banner penultimate. When his Blue un-Roots,
there is no second Seed and no clean road.
Drills (count them aloud).
1. Two-Lane Ledger. Before any central hit, name two shortest banners and their
penults. If you cannot name them, you are not allowed to hit.
2. Stagger Clock. Script two turns that force his two specials (one per turn). Be
adjacent on the stagger breath. If you were not adjacent, you asked for luck.
57
3. SSI–XS Weave. Touch the Cross only when XS≥1; Seed only when SSI≥2.
If one count is short, play Red (time) not Blue (blood).
“A wise player lays lids before he lays hands. The Blue is not a hunter—it is a
calendar. Tie your knots in breaths, not in bodies.”
58
6 Fenwood’s Memorandum on the Canray Theory
Fenwood’s Memorandum on the Canray Theory
Thesis I. Five clocks, two ledgers. All winning lines reconcile the Five-Breath timers
with two resource ledgers: Specials (their Blue’s s:D / s:H remaining)
and the Cap Clock (Greens on board vs. global cap). If a move does not
improve a timer or a ledger, it is ornament.
Thesis II. The double is the only opening theory that matters. As second player, the
double must do two different jobs: threat and structure (e.g., Orange on 3
probe plus Red on 2 anchor). If you answer speed with speed instead of
shape, you are already paying interest on their initiative.
Thesis III. The Cross is a lever, not a throne. Touch the Central Four only with
XS ≥1 (a certified exit next ply). Enter to rotate their lattice or to bleed
a special; never to hold it.
Thesis IV. Sanctum is investment, gated by SSI. Seed only when SSI ≥2 (their Blue
two plies away or out of specials). Treat Seeds like capital allocation:
return is tempo and a runner; cost is a Rooted Blue and a telegraphed
ledger entry. Use a “phantom Sanctum” (post an Orange on the opposite
Sanctum) to cancel their dividend before it pays.
Thesis V. Reforge decides more games than capture. A Blue capture is a budget, not
a banner. If your RC graph does not deny the two fastest lanes in ≤2
plies, you did not catch a Blue; you bought a noose. When down a Blue:
one runner, one route, no romance.
Thesis VI. Opposing Apex Return is a test, not a flourish. OAR is correct when
the map is thin (low density; penults pre-broken) and the returned Blue
shortens your next banner or lengthens theirs. Tempo schools gain most
from OAR; control schools punish it unless exits are pre-cleared.
Thesis VII. Style taxonomy (play the person, not the banner). Control (Ykrul, Viter-
ran): count exits; win by five quiet turns. Beat by advertising the wrong
exit and welding the right one. Parity (Thepyrgosi, Lethai): refuse noise;
prove inevitability. Beat by forcing a true choice that costs a special. Tem-
po/Theatrics (Vilikari, Silkstrand): dictate with probes and hops. Beat
by scheduling stagger appointments (force s:H now, s:D next; be adjacent
when they root). Ledger (Aeler, Aelinnel): price everything; win on ROI
and cap. Beat by creating positions where the only plus-EV line spends a
special they wanted to save.
Thesis VIII. Healthy environments trade roads, not bodies. Attrition matters only
insofar as it erases ZoC on penults and fork squares. If a capture does not
change those, it was vanity.
Thesis IX. Three common errors I still fine students for. (i) Seeding into a saved cut:
you invested; they audited. (ii) Cross camping: the fuse is three of your
turns; pivot, do not pose. (iii) Early Blue capture without an RC map:
the crowd cheered; the ledger wept.
Thesis X. How to win more tomorrow than today. Write down each turn: (i) their
SSI, (ii) your XS if you touch Four next, (iii) CCA drift if one Green
changed hands. The player who keeps those three numbers honest wins the
tournament and the tavern.

7 Variant Play (Expansion)
Like water, play returns to its level. The young seek novelty, the old seek comfort;
between them the wise find balance. Set your stones as you may—they remember their
home.
—Admiral Saref of the Red Shoal
This section collects optional, tournament-safe variants that tilt the meta without changing the
soul of the game. Each dials a single lever you already use (cap, Cross timers, Sanctums, Reforge,
openings). Organizers should announce which variants are ON/OFF before seating.
How to Use These
Choose at most one variant from each row (Cap & Seeds / Cross / Reforge / Openings /
Scoring). For Speed/Lightning events, prefer lighter-time options marked (Speed).
Short Supply / Open Wells (Green Cap Dials)
Short Supply. Set the global Green cap to 4 instead of 6.
Open Wells. Set the global Green cap to 8 instead of 6.
Meta. Cap=4 rewards Control schools (Seed famine pressure). Cap=8 rewards Tempo
schools (frequent runners, livelier Reforge races).
Greens-Only Plant (Runner Restriction)
Only Green may plant the banner during Reforge (R/O cannot plant). Other rules un-
changed.
Meta. Elevates Seed planning and Sanctum play; reduces “all-pieces sprint” solves.
Sanctum Cooldown (Well Goes Dry)
After any Seed involving Sanctum S, mark S cooling. For the next 2 of that player’s
turns, S cannot be used to Seed again (the opposite Sanctum remains usable). Remove the
mark after the cooldown.
Meta. Prevents same-well Seed chains; encourages opposite-Sanctum races and ring pivots.
Component: a coin/pip per Sanctum.
Cross Knife-Edge / Broad Crossing (CF Timers)
Knife-Edge (Speed). Cross stay 2 (not 3); Cross exile 2 (unchanged).
Broad Crossing. Cross stay 4; Cross exile 1.
Meta. Knife-Edge promotes touch-and-go raids and faster exits. Broad Crossing favors
parity staging and longer central scaffolds.
Reforge Ladder (Placement Unlocks)
Your first successful Reforge: Home Apex only.
Your second: Sanctum or Home.
Your third+: Opposing Apex / Sanctum / Home (normal costs/restrictions).
Meta. Adds comeback texture; reduces early Opposing-Apex spikes; makes banner timing a
campaign rather than a coin flip.
61
Spent Courier (Greens Trade Themselves)
Whenever a Green captures, remove that Green after the capture resolves (the target is still
removed).
Meta. Pushes Greens back toward “runner/raid” identity; discourages attritional skirmishes
with Couriers.
Opening Draft (Set-Piece Tuning)
Before the first move, starting with the second player, alternate relocating a total of 3
pieces each within your home four ranks: 2 Reds + 1 Orange. Squares must be empty
and legal; Blues and Greens may not be moved. Then play as normal.
Meta. Breaks memorized lines; tests structure preferences; zero rules weight during play.
Ring Count (Timed Scoring Ending)
At a pre-announced turn limit (e.g., 30 full turns), if no win condition has fired, score:
+1 per friendly piece on the ring (non-Cross edge squares), +2 per friendly piece on any
Sanctum.
Tiebreak: fewer total captures.
Meta. Great for leagues/showcases; rewards lane ownership over brawls.
Director’s Notes
Announce clearly. Post a card listing which variants are ON/OFF.
Component tips. Sanctum Cooldown: 2 tokens per player; OAR Toll/Spent Courier:
ensure extra Greens in the common supply; Ring Count: have a ring diagram on the
player aid.
Speed pairing. For Speed/Lightning events, pair Knife-Edge (Cross) with Short Supply
(Cap=4) for crisp, tactical rounds that finish on time.

8 Quarters & Triad - Four & Three Player Variants)
The Four–Lantern Truce
“Four banners at one ford is not a battle, it is a bargain you haven’t named yet.” — field
note attributed to Captain Lathan “No–Colors” Bloodgoode
They say Quarters began on a rain–shiny night at Four–Gates Ford, when four companies
reached the shallows together and none would be the first to wade. Lanterns were planted at
the cardinal stones to mark each captain’s claim; a wetted canvas was chalked into a diamond
and pegged taut with knife points.
The river was in spate; tempers were, too. So the Oshiiran Crossbowman’s Captain spoke
lantern–law: “Strike the neighbor, not the mirror. You may not cross your own light, nor
the light that faces it.” The Ykrul captain grunted assent; the Aeler factor shuffled coins; the
Silkstrand bravo smiled like a cutpurse. They played until dawn to set the order of crossing.
No man swore fealty, yet two moved and two watched, and the ford held.
Since then, whenever four banners share a road, the canvas comes out: each corner a
home–light and sanctum, alliances as fickle as the current, and victory claimed by the
company that turns neighbors into ferrymen. The rules travel well because the river does:
don’t camp the middle, don’t charge your mirror, and mind the lantern you planted.
Provenance. Recorded from three inconsistent testimonies (Kharax caravanserai ledger,
Oshiiran Captain’s register, and an Ecktorian quartermaster’s diary), collated by Aqyl of
Thepyrgos. Dates disagree; the ford and the lanterns do not.
8.1 Quarters (Four–Player Free–for–All)
Four players begin in the four corners of the diamond. Quarters preserves core Kon’reh while
tightening tempo spikes and keeping politics readable.
Table & Turn Order
• Seating: One player per corner (each corner is that player’s Home Apex).
• Turn order: Clockwise; no opening double–move. One move per turn throughout.
Setup (per player)
• R1 (Home Apex): Blue.
• R2 (length 2): two Oranges (both squares).
• R3 (length 3): Red–Green–Red (from the player’s perspective).
• R4: omitted (the four back–rank Reds are not placed, to keep lanes open in 4P).
Green supply: Personal cap (P–Cap)= 3 Greens per player; Global cap= 8 Greens total across
all players. Provide a shared reserve accordingly.
Movement, ZoC, Capture
As in core rules: lane slides; entering enemy ZoC ends the move; R/O/G capture by displacement
only. Blue may slide then use one special (never special→slide), and may not use a special if
that slide entered enemy ZoC.
63
Blue Specials (Crown Stagger OFF)
• Crown Stagger: OFF in Quarters.
• Special cooldown (gentle brake): After your Blue uses any special (Hop or Displacement),
it may not use a special on your next turn. (It may still slide.) Place a small cooldown
marker; remove it at the start of your following turn.
• One special per Blue turn still applies.
Central Four (the Cross)
• Stay cap = 2 of your consecutive turns. A stay is counted only if your turn ends with Blue
on a Cross square.
• Exclusion = 2 of your turns after leaving before re–entry. Exclusion begins only after a
counted stay is followed by an exit.
• Illegal fourth stay remedy: If you would end a third consecutive stay and cannot legally
exit next turn without violating the 2/2 rule, the move is illegal; choose a legal move that does
not end in the Cross.
Twin Apex Seed (adjacent–only)
• Adjacent–only: A Blue may Seed only between adjacent corner Sanctums. You may not
Seed to your own Home Apex nor straight across to the opposite corner.
• Mobilization delay (as core): You may not Seed on that Blue’s first departure from Home
in its current life. (Reforge placement onto a Sanctum is not a “departure.”)
• Rooted on Seed: The Blue that Seeded is Rooted until your next turn.
• Seed cooldown (gentle brake): After you Seed, you may not Seed on your next turn.
Track with a simple checkbox/tick; clear it the following turn.
Reforge (4P)
• If your Blue is captured, you have five of your turns to plant a banner by ending a move
on any opponent’s Home Apex.
• On success: remove the runner; then choose one placement for your Blue and immediately
pay its cost/restriction:
– Opposing Apex (corner directly across): OAR—sacrifice one of your Greens.
– Either adjacent Sanctum: that Blue may never Seed from that same Sanctum
this life.
– Your Home Apex: no cost.
• Reforged Blue returns with both specials refreshed; clear any special–cooldown marker on
return.
Eliminations & Victory
• Elimination: If a player’s Reforge countdown reaches 0 without a successful plant, that
player is eliminated; remove all of their pieces. Play continues among the remaining players.
64
• Win: Last remaining player with a Blue on the board wins. (For points events, record finish
order by elimination.)
Why these defaults (brief)
P–Cap 3 + Global cap 8 prevents cap–math snowballs in FFA; special cooldown replaces Stagger
with a simpler brake on spike turns; Seed cooldown stops lateral Seed spam; Cross 2/2 keeps the
center a connector, not a bunker; adjacent–only Seed localizes pressure and politics.
Tracking aids: one “special–cooldown” chip per Blue; one “seed–cooldown” checkbox per player;
Cross stay/exclusion pips; P–Cap pips (0–3) per player; a shared Green–cap dial (0–8).
Pocket 4 ×4 Heuristics (Table Notes)
The 4 ×4 diamond compresses space so hard that one stone often decides a lane. Use these quick
guides for micro play, drills, or pocket demos. (They are rule-agnostic: they hold whether you
use no-Seed, single-special, or shortened Reforge.)
• Every Red is a Wall. On the pocket board a single Red on a penultimate square often closes
a lane outright. Post Reds where they cut two last-step end-squares; avoid “pretty” symmetry
that doesn’t remove an exit.
• Oranges are Switches, not Spears. An Orange that relabels a lane (turns a safe end-square
into ZoC) is worth more than a forward stab that trades and reopens the file.
• Cross is a Fuse, not a Throne. The center is two moves from almost anywhere; treat a
Cross touch as a pivot or toll flip, not a camp. Enter only when you already know the next
end-square is legal.
• mXS (Micro Exit Certainty). Before you touch the Cross, count exits you still hold after
the next enemy move.
– mXS = 0: do not enter; you are volunteering a capture or a stall.
– mXS = 1: playable only if that exit is not a single-capture trap.
– mXS = 2: safe; take the pivot.
• mSSI (Micro Seed Safety Index), if Seed is ON. Seed only if an enemy punish next
move is impossible or screenable.
– 0: an enemy piece can step onto the Seed square next ply (or Blue has an adjacent special)
⇒no.
– 1: nearest punish is 2+ plies away or requires a trade you welcome.
– 2: no punish exists within 2+ plies; or your screen is already posted.
• Reforge is a Sprint. With shortened counters, name the banner lane aloud and spend every
ply advancing or welding that one path. Detours lose the race.
• Hop-Capture Caution. A hop that lands you into double ZoC on 4 ×4 is a self-pin. Only
hop if (i) it creates immediate mXS = 2, or (ii) it removes the only stopper on your fastest
lane.
65
• Don’t Double-Block Yourself. Your own Red on the penultimate can shut you out. Before
you drop a lid, ask: “Do I also remove my only legal end-square next turn?” If yes, place one
square earlier.
• Corners are Sanctums-in-Spirit. Even without Seed, corner occupancy often relabels
nearby ends. Treat corners as relays: step in to change prices, step out before you’re caged.
• Trade Time, not Shape. On a tiny board, a “pretty” lattice is dead wood. Prefer moves
that steal a ply (force a reaction) over moves that mirror.
• Two-Ply Weld Wins. The classic “Red cut + Orange fork” is often decisive on 4 ×4.
Visualize it every turn; deny your opponent the second ply of their weld before it lands.
Pocket Checklists (Say it before you move)
Pre-Cross. Do I have mXS ≥1? If only 1, does that exit avoid immediate capture?
What single Red post flips their safest end-square to ZoC?
Pre-Seed (if ON). Is mSSI ≥1? Can I screen with one move if pressed? Does this
Seed also flip a lane (relabel an end-square)?
After a Blue Capture (I captured). Name the two shortest banners; can I weld both
with “Red now, Orange next”? If not, I didn’t really catch a Blue.
After my Blue Falls. Pick one banner lane; every ply either advances the runner or
removes exactly one stopper on that lane. No sightseeing.
Before Any Hop. Does the landing square avoid double ZoC? Does it create mXS = 2
or remove their only stopper? If neither, don’t hop.
8.2 Quarters: Teams (Two–by–Two Variant)
Two players per side; partners sit at opposite corners. Teams adopts the Quarters table layout
but keeps the core ruleset lean and fast.
Table, Partners & Turn Order
• Seating: Four corners; partners opposite.
• Turn order: Clockwise A–B–C–D (partners alternate). No opening double–move.
Setup (per player)
• R1 (Home Apex): Blue.
• R2 (length 2): two Oranges (both squares).
• R3 (length 3): Red–Green–Red (from the player’s view).
• R4: omitted (keeps lanes open in 4P).
Green supply: Personal cap (P–Cap) = 3 per player; Global cap = 8 total. Provide a shared
reserve.
Movement, ZoC, Capture (as core)
• Lane slides as in core; entering enemy ZoC ends the move. Allied ZoC never restricts
you.
66
• R/O/G capture by displacement only. You cannot capture or hop your partner’s pieces; allied
pieces occupy squares normally (you cannot move onto them).
• Blue may slide, then use one special (never special→slide), and not if that slide entered enemy
ZoC.
Blue Specials
• Crown Stagger: ON. After spending its second special in the same life, Blue is Rooted
until your next turn.
• Limit: At most one special per Blue turn (Hop or Displacement).
Central Four (the Cross)
• Stay cap = 2 consecutive of your turns (tightened for 4P pacing).
• Exclusion = 2 of your turns after leaving before re–entry (as core).
Twin Apex Seed (adjacent–only)
• Adjacent–only: You may Seed only between adjacent corner Sanctums. You may not Seed
to your own Home Apex nor straight across to the opposite corner.
• Mobilization delay (as core): You may not Seed on that Blue’s first departure from Home
in its current life. (Reforge placement onto a Sanctum is not a “departure.”)
• Rooted on Seed: The Blue that Seeded is Rooted until your next turn.
Reforge (Teams)
• When your Blue is captured, you have five of your turns to plant a banner by ending a
move on any opponent’s Home Apex.
• On success: remove the runner; then choose and pay a placement option for your Blue:
– Opposing Apex (directly across): OAR—sacrifice one of your Greens (the runner may
pay).
– Either adjacent Sanctum: this Blue may never Seed from that same Sanctum
this life.
– Your Home Apex: no cost.
• The returned Blue refreshes both specials.
• Who may plant? By default, only your own runner may plant to return your Blue. (See
optional variant below.)
Variant — Ally Plant Assist (Optional)
If your partner’s Blue is on Reforge, either teammate’s runner may plant on an
opponent’s Home Apex to return it. The planter pays any OAR cost; the returned Blue
belongs to the captured player and appears per the chosen placement. Directors should
announce ON/OFF before play.
67
Eliminations & Victory
• Player elimination: If a player’s Reforge countdown reaches 0 without a successful plant,
that player is eliminated; remove their pieces. The teammate continues.
• Team victory: The last team with at least one Blue on the board wins (both opponents
eliminated or timed out).
Table Talk (Director’s Setting)
• Open partners (default): Free verbal discussion; no touching a partner’s pieces; no written
notes.
• Silent partners (variant): Only fixed calls allowed: “check,” “seed,” “reforge k,” “pass/your
lane.” Directors announce setting pre–event.
Why these defaults (brief)
P–Cap 3 + Global 8 keep cap math fair across two teams; Stagger ON preserves Blue-discipline
without extra bookkeeping; Cross 2/2 keeps the center connective, not campable; adjacent–only
Seed localizes pressure and creates clean partner handoffs without rules overhead.
Tracking aids: Cross stay/exclusion pips; Rooted marker; P–Cap pips (0–3) per player; shared
Green–cap dial (0–8); optional “Ally Plant Assist ON/OFF” card.
Quarters: Team Heuristics (Table Notes)
These quick counts and rules of thumb fit the Teams defaults: Cross stay/exclusion = 2/2,
adjacent–only Seed, Crown Stagger ON (no extra cooldowns), P–Cap = 3 per player, Global
cap = 8.
• T–SSI (Team Seed Safety Index). Seed only if both opponents are at least two plies from
a punish or out of relevant specials, and your partner can cover the Sanctum end–square next
full cycle.
Scale: 0 = an opponent’s Blue can reach next turn with a special; 1 = nearest punish is 2+
plies or special–starved; 2 = both opponents are 2+ plies and special–starved and partner has
a covering zone. Seed at ≥1; prefer 2.
• T–XS (Team Exit Certainty). Before touching the Cross, count exits that remain legal
through the next two enemy plies and your partner’s reply. Include exits your partner can
re–open with one slide. Enter Cross at T–XS ≥1 (T–XS = 2 is safe).
• PRW (Partner Relay Window). Turns until your partner can meaningfully act on your
current threat (0, 1, or 2+). Aim for PRW ≤1 when you Seed or Cross–poke; otherwise you
hand them an unplayable tempo.
• PCP (Personal–Cap Pressure). With P–Cap = 3, track (your Greens) vs (partner’s). If
you’re at 3 and partner is at 1, stall your next Seed so partner can occupy cap space and
threaten Reforge assist.
• G8 Dial Discipline. At global cap = 8, no team can Seed. If your team leads on total
Greens and position, freeze the dial; if behind, trade off a low–impact Green to re–open a Seed
for your partner.
68
• Stagger Scheduling (Blue). Because Crown Stagger is ON, plan special usage so that
if you’re forced to spend a second special this life, the Rooted turn lands when your partner
can cover (PRW ≤1). Do not “Stagger into silence.”
• Baton Rule (Cross 2/2). Partners should “hand the baton” across the Cross: A touches
Cross (stay 1), exits to a Sanctum clamp; two plies later C (ally) touches Cross while A serves
exclusion. Keep only one allied Blue inside the 2–stay window at a time.
• Two–Front Weld. To deny a single opponent’s Reforge plant, your side should seal two
shortest lanes: one by you (Red cut), one by your partner (Orange fork). If either weld forces
a detour of ≥2 plies, the 5–turn Reforge becomes unlikely.
• PCD (Plant Clock Differential). Let min(their RC)−min(our RC) be the smallest
Reforge counter across teams. If ≤1, shift to capture–light play and lane denial; if ≥2 in
your favor, press trades that simplify and advance a plant.
• Adjacent–Only Seed Geometry. Treat corner Sanctums like relay ports. Good Seeds either
(i) open a partner hop–in two plies later, or (ii) flip a ring file so your partner’s next slide
becomes a lid. Bad Seeds strand a Green into double ZoC with PRW = 2+.
• Don’t Double–Block Allies. An allied piece blocks your lanes as surely as an enemy.
Before posting a Red, ask: “Does this square also cut my partner’s only safe end–square next
cycle?” If yes, choose the penultimate instead.
• Ally Plant Assist (if ON).If the event allows AllyPlantAssist, track AW (AssistWindow):
plies until either teammate can plant for a return. If AW (team) < AW (opponents), trade
down and race to plant; otherwise weld first, raid later.
Team Checklists (Say it before you move)
Pre–Seed. T–SSI ≥1? PRW ≤1? Partner has a covering slide? Global cap < 8?
Cross Entry. T–XS ≥1 (prefer 2)? Partner’s baton turn lands during your exclusion?
Any enemy special available this ply?
Post–Capture (they took your Blue). Name the two shortest lanes aloud; ask partner
which they can weld this turn. If neither, choose Home placement; if one, choose adjacent
Sanctum (not same–Sanctum lock) to shorten their banner by 1.
P–Cap Discipline. If you’re at Green 3 and partner at 1, you trade a Green before they
Seed; if partner at 3 and you at 1, hold your Seed until a capture re–opens space.
69
8.3 Triad (Three–Player Variant)
Three players begin in three corners of the diamond; the fourth corner is a neutral Bastion. Triad
preserves core Kon’reh while tightening tempo and keeping politics readable.
Table & Turn Order
• Seating: One player per active corner (each is that player’s Home Apex); the remaining
corner is the Bastion (neutral).
• Turn order: Clockwise; no opening double–move. One move per turn throughout.
Setup (per player)
• R1 (Home Apex): Blue.
• R2 (length 2): two Oranges (both squares).
• R3 (length 3): Red–Green–Red (from the player’s perspective).
• R4: omitted (keeps lanes open in 3P).
Bastion (two–rank wall): In the vacant corner, fill the two ranks nearest that corner with
neutral Red counters (all squares of those two ranks).
• Neutral Reds are impassable, uncapturable, and may not be hopped. They exert normal
ZoC.
Movement, ZoC, Capture (as core)
• Lane slides as in core. Entering enemy or neutral ZoC ends the move.
• R/O/G capture by displacement only.
• Blue may slide then use one special (never special→slide), and not if that slide entered ZoC.
Blue Specials (Crown Stagger OFF)
• Crown Stagger: OFF in Triad.
• Special cooldown (gentle brake): After your Blue uses any special (Hop or Displacement),
it may not use a special on your next turn. (It may still slide.) Clear the cooldown
marker at the start of your following turn.
• One special per Blue turn still applies.
Central Four (the Cross)
• Stay cap = 2 consecutive turns (tightened).
• Exclusion = 2 of your turns after leaving before re–entry (unchanged).
Reminder (adjudication): Exclusion is set only if your previous turn ended with Blue in the
Cross. Enter–then–exit in the same turn does not start exclusion.
70
Twin Apex Seed (adjacent–only)
• Pads: Your Sanctum Pads are the two enemy corners (never the Bastion corner).
• Adjacent–only: You may Seed only between adjacent Pads (i.e., to a neighboring player’s
corner). You may not Seed to your own Home Apex nor “straight across.”
• Mobilization delay (as core): You may not Seed on that Blue’s first departure from Home
in its current life. (Reforge placement onto a Sanctum is not a “departure.”)
• Rooted on Seed (as core): the Blue that Seeded is Rooted until your next turn.
• Seed cooldown (new): After you Seed, you may not Seed on your next turn. Track
with a simple checkbox/tick; clear it the following turn.
Reforge (3P)
• If your Blue is captured, you have five of your turns to plant a banner by ending a move
on any opponent’s Home Apex.
• On success: remove the runner; then choose one placement for your Blue and immediately
pay its cost/restriction:
– Opposing Apex (the corner directly across): OAR—sacrifice one of your Greens.
– Either adjacent Sanctum (enemy corner): your Blue may never Seed from that
same Sanctum this life.
– Your Home Apex: no cost.
• Reforged Blue returns with both specials refreshed (its special–cooldown marker, if any, is
cleared).
Green Supply & Victory
• Global Green cap = 7 (shared). Provide a common reserve so legal Seeds are physically
possible.
• Elimination: If a player’s Reforge countdown reaches 0 without a successful plant, that
player is eliminated; remove all of their pieces. Play continues among the remaining players.
• Win: Last remaining player with a Blue on the board wins. (For points events, record finish
order by elimination.)
Why these defaults (brief)
Two–rank Bastion funnels without freezing; Cross 2/2 keeps the center a connector, not a bunker;
special cooldown replaces Stagger with a simpler brake; Seed cooldown prevents pad–to–pad spam;
cap 7 creates meaningful cap–pressure without routine lockups.
Tracking aids: One “special–cooldown” chip per Blue; one “seed–cooldown” tick per player; Cross
stay/exclusion pips; shared Green–cap dial (0–7).
Heavy Bastion (3–Rank Wall) — Optional Adjustments
For a more constricting, control–forward table, fill three ranks of the vacant corner with
neutral Reds (same neutrality/ZoC rules). This pushes traffic toward the open side and
71
makes banners longer and more legible—fun for net–builders. To keep momentum:
• Option A (recommended): Raise Global cap to 8. Fewer hard freezes; Seeds
remain a live tool.
• Option B (pressure release): Keep cap 7, but if the dial is at 7/7, allow one Seed
to ignore Seed cooldown (per player life). Mark it when used.
• Return advice: In heavy geometry, Home return is often safer than OAR; take
OAR when dropping the cap (by 1) helps unlock your next Seed or denies an opponent’s.
Triad Heuristics (Table Notes)
In three–hand play you act, then two opponents move before you again. Read clocks over a
two–ply horizon, and use the neutral Bastion’s ZoC like a fixed fence.
• 3P–SSI (Seed Safety Index). Seed only if both opponents cannot punish next ply.
– 0: some opponent’s Blue can reach with a special next ply or any piece can displace onto
the Seed square ⇒no.
– 1: nearest punish by each opponent is ≥2 plies or that opponent is on special–cooldown
and the route is screenable.
– 2: both opponents are ≥2 plies and special–starved; your screen is already posted.
Seed at ≥1; prefer 2. Remember Seed–cooldown: you won’t be able to Seed again next turn.
• 3P–XS (Exit Certainty). Before touching the Cross, count exits that remain legal after
the next two enemy plies.
– 0: do not enter; you’re volunteering a trap.
– 1: playable only if the lone exit is not a single–capture bait for either opponent.
– 2: safe; take the pivot (Cross is a fuse, not a throne).
• BWP (Bastion Wall Pressure). Treat the neutral wall as an extra defender:
– Use the Bastion’s ZoC to shorten their pursuers (they must stop when entering it).
– Don’t plan lanes that require crossing neutral ZoC; you can’t pass through or hop neutral
Reds.
• Pad Geometry (adjacent–only Seed). Good Seeds either (i) open a relay toward a
neighbor corner, or (ii) flip a ring file so both opponents’ “obvious” ends fall into ZoC. Bad
Seeds strand a Green into double ZoC with no two–ply escape.
• LCD (Leader Containment Differential). Let
LCD = (leader’s total Greens−your total Greens) + ⊮[leader’s RC is shorter]
If LCD > 0, avoid trades that hand the leader tempo or cap space; steer fights so the other
opponent contests the leader.
• RC Triangulation (after a Blue falls). On capture, name the two shortest banner lanes
on the board—one for each opponent. Weld the one you can touch in one ply and return your
Blue to reduce the other (Home by default; adjacent Sanctum if it shortens their banner; OAR
only when the 1–Green toll buys tempo vs both).
72
• Cooldown Accounting (specials & Seeds). Mark who just spent a Blue special or Seed;
their next turn is constrained. Pressure that opponent while the other watches—don’t hand
the fresh opponent a free punish.
• Cap–7 Discipline. At dial = 7, no one can Seed. If ahead on Greens & position, freeze the
dial; if behind, trade off a low–value Green to re–open Seed for you, not the leader.
• Don’t Crown the Third. Any capture or pivot that gives one opponent a plant while the
other is busy is kingmaking. Before a flashy strike, ask: “Who benefits second?”
• Two–Ply Weld Still Wins. The classic “Red cut + Orange fork” is decisive in 3P—just
assume the other opponent will test the seam. Place lids that remain lids after an extra ply.
Triad Checklists (Say it before you move)
Pre–Seed. 3P–SSI ≥1? Spawned Green has a two–ply escape vs both opponents?
Seed–cooldown ready next cycle? Cap < 7?
Cross Entry. 3P–XS ≥1 (prefer 2)? Does neutral ZoC cover your pivot? Which
opponent moves next, and do they have a fresh special?
After I Captured Blue. Name both shortest banners; which can I weld now? Blue
return: Home (default), Adjacent Sanctum (shorten their banner), OAR (only if the toll
buys tempo vs both).
Cap & Leader. If leader’s LCD > 0, avoid trades that open cap or lanes for them; press
the other opponent’s interference instead.
School Implications on Pocket Boards
4×4 Pocket Diamond — What Changes
• Dhahara (Courtly Control). Stronger: single Red posts “price” lanes outright. Play
for quick two-ply adjudications (Red lid →Orange fork). Beware hyper-tempo stabs
that jump your toll.
• Oshiira (Logistics Control). Depots compress: overbuilding dies. Think “one weld,
one pivot” cycles; pre-plan exactly two conversions that flip end-squares.
• Ashaani (Veil & Threat). Pageantry shrinks; threat density rises. Use paper walls
(fake stoppers) and one-turn lantern touches; force a single obvious reply, punish the
file over.
• Kahfagia (Maritime Parity). Buffed: false beacons (relabel ends) are brutal on tiny
coasts. Cross is a tack, never a camp; win by changing the safe channel twice.
• Ykrul (Lock Control). Nets are terrifying—one Red can erase a lane. Don’t double-
block your own exits; lock two penultimates, then wait.
• Vilikari (Tempo Theft). Big buff. One clean raid steals the whole cycle. Enter Cross
only with mXS≥1; take instant pivots to ring relays.
• Thepyrgosi (Proof Parity). Mirrors are fragile; a single off-beat homeward slide
breaks parity. Prove exits, not shapes.
• Vhasian (Honor Bait). Fewer theatrics, sharper knives. Set one clean “good exchange
you don’t want,” score on the file they overguard.
• Viterran (Fortress Control). Turtling fails—no space. Build gates, not walls: one
stopper + one relabel per turn.
73
• Aeler (Economic Grind). If Seed is ON, cap races end fast—track CCA ruthlessly.
If Seed is OFF, play like Dhahara with better toll math.
• Lethai (Single-Stroke). Very strong: zugzwang emerges quickly. Count to the banner;
avoid any hop that lands into double ZoC.
• Cartwright (Clock Asymmetry). Thrives: desync Cross stay vs. exile, then trade
shape for time. Break the mirror with a single retreating Prop.
2×4 Micro-Strip — What Survives
Virtually rail-bound: many plays reduce to one or two banner lanes; Cross influence (if
any) is momentary; Seed windows (if ON) are razor-thin.
• Dhahara. Still viable: a single tithe-post wins a lane. Price early; accept ugly profit.
• Oshiira. Overhead hurts—no room for “network.” Pre-script one weld ladder and
repeat.
• Ashaani. Illusion →compulsion: one “obvious” reply is all you need. Trade your
reveal for their only legal step.
• Kahfagia. Channel play shines: relabel the last step twice in three plies. Never
broadside; always pilotage.
• Ykrul. Maybe best on strip: two posts = no road. Beware self-cage; leave your own
end-square legal.
• Vilikari. Premier pick: first read wins. Don’t linger; every raid must become a banner
tempo.
• Thepyrgosi. Pure parity is brittle; prove inevitability by exit count, not mirror.
• Vhasian. Bait →strike works if the strike removestheonlystopper. No pageants—only
blades.
• Viterran. Convert to moving gates: post–probe–post. Static fences lose the race.
• Aeler. With Seed ON, CCA swings are decisive; with Seed OFF, play tight tolls and
force early trades.
• Lethai. Deadly: one forced lane, no oxygen. But a single miscount loses out-
right—verify banner math.
• Cartwright. Clock tricks still rule: desync turn order around a single exit, then cash
the sprint.
Triad (3-Player, Bastion) — What Changes
Global shifts. Two opponents act before you: read a two-ply horizon, watch cooldowns,
use the neutral Bastion’s ZoC as a fixed fence, track cap=7politics, and avoid crowning
the third (don’t hand a plant to the bystander).
• Dhahara (Courtly Control). Toll the lanes that skirt the Bastion; price the leader’s
shortest banner. Prefer freezes that hurt both foes to raids that help one.
• Oshiira (Logistics Control). One weld that serves against two > networks. Use
Bastion edges as “free posts;” pre-script a single cut→fork that still holds after an extra
ply.
• Ashaani (Veil & Threat). Stage dilemmas that force different replies from each foe;
74
punish the one who blinks. Check every reveal for kingmaking.
• Kahfagia (Maritime Parity). Pilot along Bastion “coastlines;” false beacons that
relabel ends near neutral ZoC punish both opponents at once.
• Ykrul (Lock Control). Triangulate cages with the Bastion as your third post. Watch
self-cage: a perfect net can gift the plant to the outsider.
• Vilikari (Tempo Theft). Raid the fresh cooldown target then disappear behind Bastion
cover. Tempo spikes are huge—but so is kingmaking; cash only into shared denial.
• Thepyrgosi (Proof Parity). Pure mirror breaks under two-ply pressure. Prove
inevitability by exit counts on the leader; use Bastion to force asymmetry.
• Vhasian (Honor Bait). Baits must cash into denial, not display. A clean exchange
that opens a lane for the third player is a loss.
• Viterran (Fortress Control). Build gates at Bastion gaps (stopper + relabel), not
walls. Overbuilding hands tempo to the free rider.
• Aeler (Economic Grind). Track CCA vs two foes; at cap=7 freeze if ahead, reopen
if behind (but not for the leader). Toll flips that affect both players are your best “profit.”
• Lethai (Single-Stroke). Still deadly—zugzwang arrives quickly along Bastion lanes.
Time the stroke so the other opponent can’t cash a free plant.
• Cartwright (Clock Asymmetry). Thrives: desync Cross stay/exile across two
clocks; manipulate turn order around Bastion chokepoints, then bank the sprint.

8.4 Triarch Skirmish (3v1)
Sides. Solo Commander (SC) vs. Triarch Council (TC: three captains A/B/C).
Armies. SC: standard set. TC: each captain owns 1 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Red (no Oranges).
Setup. SC sets up normally. TC sets from the opposite Home corner: R1 Apex holds exactly
one TC Blue (others in reserve); R2 empty; R3 holds the three TC Reds; R4 empty. TC Greens
enter via Seed.
Turn Order. A→B→C.
Standard alternation; second player takes the opening double–move (recommend
SC second). On each TC turn, exactly one captain moves one of their pieces; captains rotate
Triarch Throttles.
• TC Blue limit: at most 2 TC Blues may be on the board at once.
• Deploy (reserve Blue): on a TC turn, instead of moving, a captain may place one
reserve Blue on an empty TC Sanctum that currently holds a TC Green; remove that Green
(cost). The deployed Blue returns with both specials unused.
• TC Seeds: at most 1 Seed every 2 TC turns (side-wide).
• TC specials: at most 2 total TC Blue specials may resolve between one TC turn and the
next TC turn.
• Central Four (TC): only one TC Blue may occupy the Central Four at any time.
Rules Inherited. as core.
Movement, ZoC, Central Four timers, Crown Stagger, Seed, and Reforge
Reforge. When a TC Blue is captured, the TC side has 5 TC turns to plant (any TC piece
may run); other TC Blues on board remain. When SC’s Blue is captured, SC has 5 SC turns to
plant (core options/costs).
Table Talk. Choose: Open Council / Whispers Only (10s) / Silent Rotation.
Victory. As core: failed Reforge after Blue capture ⇒win. Concession permitted.
Balance Dials (optional). If TC dominates: forbid Deploy until turn 8; cap to 1 TC
special per round; or limit TC to 1 Blue on board until first Seed. If SC dominates: grant TC
one shared Orange at setup; increase TC Seed rate to 2 per 3 TC turns; or start TC with two
Blues (Apex+Sanctum).

8.5 Toll & Veil (A Roadside Card Game)
A gambling trick–taker played along the Way of Silk; wardens, caravaneers, and dock crews all
claim to have invented it. Fast, readable, and faintly echoing Kon’reh’s clocks.
Players 3–5 (cutthroat; soft alliances at 4–5 emerge naturally).
Deck Standard 52-card (jokers out).
Markers Each player: two markers (stones/coins) labeled Cut and Leap.
Aim Meet your bid in 10 tricks; harvest bonuses without tripping the “clocks.”
Table & Deal
Deal 10 cards to each player. Flip the next card face-up to set Trump: a black flip (♣/♠)
declares Veil—trump is ♠; a red flip (♡/♢) declares Toll—trump is ♢. Locals say: “Night
favors the Veil; day favors the Toll.” Dealer rotates.
Bidding (The Road Price)
Starting left of dealer, each declares a bid (0–5) for tricks they expect to win. Dealer’s bid must
not make the sum of all bids equal exactly 10 (must “break parity”). Record bids.
Play (Five Clocks in Miniature)
• Follow suit if able; else play any card. Highest trump wins, else highest of led suit.
• The Cross (Trick 5). Winning Trick 5 grants +1 Cross but you are Excluded from
Trick 6: if you also win Trick 6, you forfeit the Cross point.
• Markers (once each per hand):
– Cut (Displacement): when playing your card, flip Cut; it counts as one rank higher this
trick (Aces cannot be boosted).
– Leap (Hop): when void in the led suit, flip Leap to play trump even if trump hasn’t been
“broken.”
• Crown Stagger. If you use both Cut and Leap in the same hand, you become Rooted: the
first time you win the lead after spending the second marker, you must pass the lead once
(skip leading; next player leads).
Scoring
Meet your bid +2
Overtricks (each trick above bid) Miss your bid –(difference)
Keep the Cross (win Trick 5, not 6) Perfect Veil (bid 0, take 0) +1 per trick
+1
+3
Table Lore
• Ykrul call it Toll & Silence: closing a ford (Trick 5) and yielding the next lane (Trick 6).
• Fhara crews prize Leap: “better a clean hop than a dirty lane.”
77
• Kahfagian skippers teach Rooted as the admiral’s warning: spend two prerogatives, stall the
fleet.
Quick Strategy
Don’t chase Cross if you can’t safely duck Trick 6. Save Leap to crack a late, off–suit win; use
Cut to edge contested tricks. Spending both markers is potent, but Rooted can hand tempo—time
it when an opponent must lead into your strength.
Concordance Variants (Optional Nights)
Use at most one row per hand.
Ykrul Lethai Trump fixed as ♢(Toll). Cross is +2 but Exclusion lasts two tricks (6 and 7).
No markers this hand. Any player who hits their bid exactly gains +1 Breath.
Vilikari After seeing your first trick result, you may adjust your bid by ±1 (once).
Play Length
First to 15 points (short) or 25 (long). Ties continue until broken.

Postscript — Fragment 79
Provenance. Lifted by Aqyl in the Thepyrgos Lyceum bindery as binder’s waste from an Aeler
ledger (Schedules of Tithe on Canal Stone, Third of Lavius). The folio bore an Ecktorian customs
docket; ash on the fore-edge; the Office of Customs’ knotted ribbon still glued into the fold. Aqyl
copied the leaf before it vanished into paste.
Fragment 79—Gamma (Dock Addendum)
I pressed Magistrate Bollus again. This time he did look up. “Everyone along the
quay knows,” he said. “They play. Nothing a clerk can seal.” He made a small circle
with his pen. “Skins. Felt. Mats. Dust.”
The dockmasters speak of thin rawhide, smoke-cured and rolled tight in thong-tubes; of
felted wool; of reed-mats scored with a tally-stick and flipped end-over-end to make a
diamond. I have heard of squares scratched into yard-dust, wetted and re-scribed each
watch. As for stones: river bone, pressed loam, salted dough baked in sun, lake-wrack
knotted with gut. When the watch turns, the field is gone. Mats rot; hides scrape
clean; dough breaks and is fed to dogs. There is nothing to seize, nothing to list.
Bollus admitted what the quaymen already say softly: the Harbor Prefect’s guidance is
not written, yet remembered exactly—do not put it in a report. Boxes that pay duty
are the only boards the ledger admits. The Ykrul, no fools, sell our houses jet and
pearl, and play their own game on skin and silt.
Thus the middens yield our boxes and keep their silence. The foreigners’ practice
travels lighter than wood and will outlast it, being written in hands and habits rather
than cedar and brass. If this is so, our Game is not merely exported; it is everywhere,
and everywhere perishable.
A Duke’s Conundrum & Confession
This Concordance was never meant for polite shelves. I set it down six years before
any respectable Corpus, in the margins of other men’s ledgers, between alarms, after
games I did not deserve to win. I have long suspected the Ykrul as the riverhead of the
Game; any factor on the marches knows it by other names. What shocks is not that
foreigners play, but that a noble should gather their proofs and bind them together.
Aqyl’s scraps unsettle me; the dockwoman’s fragment more so. If the Game is older
than our names for it, then every certainty I parade is presumption. Here is my
confession: I am not brave. I hesitate because I know what our houses prefer—an
orderly lineage, with Ecktoria at its center, not a skein of roads converging from steppe
and sea. I can feel the temptation to dress all this into a cleaner book—a Corpus fit
for drawing rooms, with its edges sanded and its provenance politely mislaid.
Shall I lock these pages under my seal? consign them to the river? slip one copy to a
discreet printer in Threx and deny it later with a steady eye? Each act is a move;
each silence, a move also. The Aeler would say the ledger is truth. The Ykrul would
laugh and say the field is truth. I stand between the two, ink on my fingers, ash on
my tongue.
Until I choose, this remains a private map of public roads. If you are reading it, then
I have either found my courage—or lost control of my valet. —Braedon Fenwood,
Tarlington, Year 856 A.R.

9 Glossaries
9.1 Concordance Heuristics (Glossary)
SSI — Seed Safety Index: As in core: safety of Sanctum Seed vs. opposing Blue range/spe-
cials.
XS — Exit Certainty: Count of certified exits next turn (esp. Central Four operations).
CCA — Cap Clock Advantage: Green count + tempo to cap pressure (who benefits at
cap=6).
CL — Courtesy Ledger (Dhahara): A simple tracker of both Blues’ special usage; the “bill”
for overreach. When CL says the foe has a special and range, treat Sanctum as closed.
TM — Toll Margin (Dhahara): Net tempo gained by forcing the opponent onto longer lanes
via ZoC “tolls.” Positive TM means the market (board) is pricing in your routes.
VC — Veil Count (Ashaani): Number of consecutive turns your Blue’s power has remained
veiled (no special revealed). Higher VC increases threat opacity; spending a special resets VC.
KW — Known Waters (Kahfagia): Squares/routes with pre-certified exits (XS≥1) two
bells ahead; fleets operate in KW, harass in unknown waters only with a planned egress.
LR — Lantern Radius (Kahfagia): The set of squares your posts/oranges currently interdict
as “lit” (ZoC + one step of weld). Wider LR reduces enemy XS.
TP — Throughput (Oshiira): Number of ‘runner-through’ lanes that can carry a Green to
banner within 5 dawns under current weld plan. If TP< 2, don’t trade captains; build depots
first.
DR — Dais Rule (Dhahara, etiquette): Voluntary restraint: a Blue touches Central Four
for at most one of its turns unless an exit is pre-filed on the Courtesy Ledger (XS≥1).
80
Glossary
Note. Entries marked “See: KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium” refer to
definitions in the core rulebook; others cross-reference sections in this expansion.
Apex: Any corner square (Home, Opposing, two Sanctums). See: KON’REH: Rules
and Core Lore Compendium.
Banner / Plant: Ending a move on the enemy Home Apex to enable Reforge placement
(start the Reforge resolution). See: KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
Basic–CF (teaching toggle): Ignore Cross exclusion (no 2–turn re-entry ban). The
3-stay cap still applies. See §??.
Basic–Mobilization (teaching toggle): Ignore Mobilization delay (Blue may Seed on
its first departure). See §??.
Blue Specials: Hop-capture (jump over 1 adjacent enemy to the empty square beyond;
remove it) and Displacement (step onto an adjacent enemy and remove it). At most
one special per Blue turn. See: KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
Cap Clock Advantage (CCA): (your Greens−theirs) + (you to cap first? + 1
2 :−
1
2 ).
If ahead, consider forcing cap = 6 to hinder their Reforge. See: KON’REH: Rules and
Core Lore Compendium.
Central Four (the Cross): The central 2 ×2 diamond. You may end at most three
consecutive your turns in the Cross; upon leaving, you must wait two of your turns before
re-entry. See: KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
Crown Buyback (tournament option): On your turn, if Blue is on Home Apex,
you may skip moving to refresh one spent Blue special by sacrificing one of your Greens.
Limit once per Blue life. Directors announce ON/OFF. See §??.
Crown Stagger: After Blue spends its second special in the same life, that Blue becomes
Rooted until your next turn. See: KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
Cross Exclusion: After Blue leaves the Cross (having ended a turn inside), you must
wait two of your turns before you may legally re-enter. See: KON’REH: Rules and Core
Lore Compendium.
Displacement (Blue special): Move 1 step in a straight line onto an adjacent enemy;
remove it. Once per Blue life. See: KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
81
Global Green Cap: At most 6 Greens total may be on the board (both players
combined). See: KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
Hop-capture (Blue special): Jump over 1 adjacent enemy in a straight line to the
empty square beyond; remove the jumped enemy. Once per Blue life. See: KON’REH:
Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
Lane Weld: Two-ply sequence (e.g., Red cut + Orange fork) that seals all certified exits
on a lane. See: KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
Mobilization Delay: You may not Seed on that Blue’s first departure from Home
in its current life. (Placement onto a Sanctum by Reforge is not a “departure.”) See:
KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
No-Progress Rule (tournament): Directors may adjudicate a draw after a fixed span
with no progress (e.g., 50 full turns with no capture or Seed in standard; Speed/Lightning
use shorter spans). See §??.
Opposing Apex: Your opponent’s Home Apex. See: KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore
Compendium.
Pie Rule (tournament variant): After P1’s provisional opener, P2 may swap sides
or keep them (the double-move belongs to whoever is second to move under your chosen
format). See §??.
Pivot: A Blue that rotates play direction by moving from one Apex corridor into another
(often Cross →Sanctum). See: KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
Reforge: When Blue is captured, you have five of your turns to plant a banner. On
success: remove the runner; choose and pay a placement option for Blue—Opposing
Apex (sacrifice a Green), either Sanctum (that Blue may never Seed from that same
Sanctum), or your Home Apex (no cost). Blue returns with both specials refreshed. See:
KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
Rooted: A Blue that just Seeded or became Staggered; it cannot move until your next
turn begins. See: KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
Sanctum: The two side apexes. Special interactions with Twin Apex Seed and some
Reforge placements. See: KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
Seed (Twin Apex Seed): If Blue ends a move on a Sanctum, you may spawn one
Green on the opposite Sanctum (if empty and global cap < 6). The Blue becomes Rooted
82
until your next turn. The same-Sanctum Seed is forbidden for a Blue that was placed
there by Reforge. See: KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
Seed Safety Index (SSI): 0: enemy Blue has ≥1 special and can reach your Sanctum
next turn. 1: enemy Blue or non-Blue capture is 2+ moves away; screenable. 2: enemy
Blue has no specials or is 2+ moves away; screened. Seed at SSI ≥1; prefer 2. See:
KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
Threefold Repetition (tournament): A draw claim when the same position (including
side to move and all counters/timers—CF stay/exile counts, Rooted, Blue special usage,
Reforge counter) occurs three times, not necessarily consecutively. See §??.
XS — Exit Certainty: Count distinct safe exits on your next turn (Cross/raid plan-
ning). Enter Cross only when XS ≥1 (XS=2 is safe). See: KON’REH: Rules and Core
Lore Compendium.
ZoC (Zone of Control): The four edge-adjacent squares around each piece. You may
enter enemy ZoC, but you may not pass through; entering ZoC ends the move. See:
KON’REH: Rules and Core Lore Compendium.
83
From a road-wet leaf, edges charred; script uncertain (fragment of
a fragment):
“...count Eight before breath, for the bowl has only eight rims; the ninth is
not a rim but a crack—seal it with salt and pass it by.
We laid the hide-board on the floor and set the Witness at the first corner;
no names were carved, for names mislead the hand.
When the Witness fell into the Ford, we turned the hour twice and spoke of the
Return; no coin changed owners—only the board changed, and then changed
back.
Remember this: leather keeps the road; wood keeps the patron. Choose
the road.”
—[illegible sign] “...the Uncarv...” [leaf torn]
[margin, later hand]: “Their rite of salt on the outer file was not insult, but
stitching. They call the ninth a wound.”

Preface — A Letter to Alayse
Alayse, my heart,
The road down to Thepyrgos is a long, slanting breath across wet country. I came by the river
stages first, then by a cart whose canvas remembered every rain it had ever known. Fields wear
the color of old copper; the ditches keep their small, stubborn mirrors; along the last rise the wind
busied itself with barley while the bells spoke over one another, each to its own hour. It is a city
that greets you with sound before it shows its face.
At our gate my father pressed his travel copy of the Concordance into my hands and said only, “Our
fourth legacy is yours now.” He smiled—as at a family tradition since the Imperial era days when
our name was Valvano. We parted on that smile. It has stood between me and poor courage ever
since, which is to say it has helped.
The University keeps two faces. By day: polished and well–kept—the bright stalls with their brass
lamps and measured shadows, the refectory with steam and bread, courts paved as smooth as
thought. And then the other: glimpsed when a porter’s key turns or a lamp gutters—low vaults,
patient stairwells, rooms that have learned to keep their breath, shelves that seem to turn themselves
if you leave and come back too quickly. Not menacing, industrious; but the stone here keeps
accounts.
I have met my tutor. He is called Aqyl, son of Aqyl.
You will laugh to know I faltered at the name. I have read Aqyl’s lectures to tatters—the elder,
the measured hand that teaches one to count aloud and copy plainer later—and here stands a
man wearing the same name as easily as a linen shirt. He has a Thepyrgosi cast to him, though
the eyes are almond and untired; he is thin and wiry, the sort of frame the wind respects, with
salt–and–pepper curls that refuse discipline and an age that will not hold still under a guess. I
asked—too bluntly—whether he is of the elder. He shrugged a little: “I am named for my father,
and he for his,” and let the matter lie where it fell, like a coin on a ledger line that refuses to roll.
He is patient beyond reason and exact without cruelty; he taps a margin once and the fault knows
what it is.
He says a clear gloss is a moral act, and that cleverness comes after honesty if it comes at all.
My first days have been proper ink: inventories, tallies, the straight work of hands that want to
be useful. Yet there are corners where the edges begin to speak to the middle. In the stalls the
rain comes down like soft chain and the pages answer; a clerk’s circle in an old ledger refuses to
be mere ornament; a map set beside a list of tolls begins, inexplicably, to agree with it. Small
things—nothing for a magistrate—yet I write them to you because you know the difference between
superstition and a hunch you can test in daylight.
Do not be anxious for me. The bright rooms are many, and I keep to them. I eat something warm
when the bells tell me to, and when the ink runs fast I put it away and count aloud, as my father
taught. If I come upon any page that feels hot, I lay a sheet over it and copy later with a cooler
hand. “You are not required to be clever,” Aqyl tells me. “You are required to be honest.” I am
doing my best at the latter and waiting on the former.
When you come (and you must), we will walk the outer courts as we used to walk the lanes, naming
buildings, counting bells. The lamps mind themselves here; the hours keep their own borders. I
iv
think you will like how the light stands up straight in the winter wind and how the old stones
approve of ordinary work.
Until then, know that I am safe, that I am listening, and that I write your name at the head of my
day before I balance any column.
Your faithful,
M.
Thepyrgos, Amber Reckoning: Leafturn, 876 AR
Dedication. For His Grace Duke Braedon Fenwood III, who taught me to count aloud and to write
what I can prove; for Aqyl (the elder), who showed me that a clear gloss is a kind of courage; and
for the players, who will decide which of these rumors hold.

1 Introduction
1.1 Purpose and Scope
Kon’reh: The Ninth Rim is a dossier–plus–scenarios volume, meant to be read as narrative and used
at the table without changing tournament play. It presents historical fragments, ledgers, and field
notes in facsimile, followed by seven optional, modular overlays (Rites) that can be toggled per
session.
1.2 How to Use This Book
Read Part I for context and atmosphere; use Part II to run one-shots or to link all seven scenarios
into a short campaign. Each Rite is self-contained, clearly labeled, and defaults to off. Turning a
Rite on changes the feel of play (information, pacing, geography) but never the core rules.
1.3 Title Gloss
“The Ninth” names the final Rite; the Rim is the perimeter band the Ninth briefly permits you to
cross.
1.4 Structure of the Volume
• Part I — A Most Curious Game (Lore in Facsimile): curated documents, marginalia,
and maps that frame the investigation.
• Part II — Rites & Scenarios: seven independent modules (Salt Stitch, Witness at the
Ford, Veil of Names, Candle Count, Copper & Salt, Ash–Fenn Rite, The Ninth) with setup,
procedure, examples, and a “Why It’s Safe” note.
• Part III — Puzzles & Scholar’s Path: hint ladders and a sealed appendix for readers
who wish to decode embedded ciphers.
• Part IV — The Sacred Geometry (Theory Sidebars): brief, non-binding notes on
rings, survey drift, cadence →digits, and related curiosities.
• Part V — Appendices & Sealed Solutions: compatibility matrix, printable props, icon
legend, encoded tables, solutions, and essays.
1.5 Editorial Notes and Conventions
Voice labels (e.g., Markus, Aqyl, Clerk) appear in margins to indicate provenance. Dates follow city-
record style. Facsimiles are lightly normalized for legibility; conjectural restorations are bracketed.
Diagram callouts and iconography are standardized for quick reference.
1.6 Continuity
This volume preserves the game’s tournament core. Scenario language is intentionally conservative
and has been reviewed for rules safety. Historical attributions reflect best-available sources; where
disputes exist, they are marked as such rather than harmonized.
Read what you like, use what you will, and leave the rest in the archives.

2 A Most Curious Game
2.1 Fragment L–1 (648 AR) — On the Lineage of Names and the Measure of
Days
Copied from a student booklet in a small slanted hand; iron–gall ink, edges smoke–kissed. A later
owner has ruled a faint line for marginal glosses.
Lexicus of Thepyrgos, Junior Reader
Amber Reckoning: Planting, Tenday II, Day 4 (648 AR)
Herewith I set down, so that I may not forget, certain observations taken in the reading–stalls and
counting–rooms. This morning I was shown a parcel of leaves attributed to Aqyl of Thepyrgos,
surnamed in the index the elder. They treat of cadence, of clarity, and of the ethics proper to a
gloss. Their sentences are so plain and right–fitted to their task that I confess I blushed to see my
own drafts beside them.
Being unwilling to labor under a confusion of persons, I asked my mentor, Master Aqyl, whether he
bore his name from that same hand whose notes I had been admiring. He answered with economy,
not unkind: “I am named for my father, and he for his, and he for his; scholars mostly, when we
were not frightened. This first Aqyl is of our house—so they say—though it is better to prove a line
by its books than by its boasts.” The manner of his shrug conserved words while granting permission
to proceed.
From the elder’s counsel I adopt at once the habit of counting aloud when the mind runs ahead;
it steadies both temper and column when the rain takes the lamps and the bindings smell of wet
leather. I will report what profit it yields.
Commonplaces for the stalls (set down for my correction):
1. Count aloud when the mind runs ahead of the ink; let breath govern hand.
2. Mark conjecture as conjecture; do not pass it as record, even briefly.
3. Where two sums disagree, copy both; resolve the quarrel; strike the error once and legibly.
4. Keep the hand even at the edges; the eye trusts a margin that does not wave.
5. If a sentence can be made plainer without loss, make it so and be grateful.
If Providence and the bursar permit, I shall look into the older cupboards for further traces of the
elder’s order: not the noise of his name, but the measure of his days.
Present marginal hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood: Asked Aqyl, son of Aqyl, the same question this
week. Received the same shrug and the same coin of a smile. Either the lineage is faithful—or
the answer is what passes down with the name. In either case, tidy.
2.2 Fragment L–2 (648 AR / 876 AR) — The Salt–Pressed Leaves
Provenance. Two hands, bound together by later custodians: the later hand (876 AR) is a journal
leaf by M. Fenwood describing a walk through the University; the earlier hand (648 AR) is a student
entry by Lexicus of Thepyrgos. Both were copied into the present volume from their respective
sources; the salt–ring stain appears on the Lexicus tract and is noted by the later hand.

Amber Reckoning: Leafturn, Tenday II, Day 3
Aqyl, son of Aqyl, led me by the long way, down the serpentine stacks where the floor lists like a
tired ship and the lamps run together into a narrow river of honey–light. His face was all edges and
patience, the sort of calm that has outlived weather. We passed a door stenciled in the University’s
square hand: condemned — closed by order of the wardens. Aqyl produced a key that
was not quite a key—a sliver of dark metal, bone–thin, that seemed to remember other locks—and
the notice became only paper.
Inside: chalk on the tongue. The air held the dry asperity of old slate. Cobwebs draped the ceiling
like fatigued banners, and the tables wore a fur of dust that remembered every elbow that had
ever leaned there. “A private study,” Aqyl said, as if declaring a weather report. “Copies and
companions to the common shelves. Lexicus left his own here. It is a forbidden place, though no
one will name it so. The University has many such unnames.”
I asked whether we should be there. He shrugged the way cliffs do. “You asked for the edges. Edges
do not keep catalog hours.” He set a travel lantern upon a desk; its little flame took hold of the
room with a steady, workman’s glow. Softer, almost to himself: “Read heresies if you must. Do not
let them lead you.”
A spine caught at me—a ledger–brown volume, the label torn into a crescent. The fore–edge wore a
hurried marginal hand that could have been Lexicus after a night without sleep. I opened where the
book wanted. There, in the middle margin, a pale ring the color of bone had bled into the paper, as
if a damp band had rested there and then been lifted: a halo pressed flat. Salt, I thought, and did
not know why. The ring held a faint scatter of grit, and when I breathed upon it, the motes rose
like ash and settled again in the shape of a circle, exact as a coin.
Something—only the air, surely—moved past my shoulder with the smallest suggestion of feathers.
I turned (of course I turned) and saw only two chairs and their twin long shadows, meeting at the
floor like folded wings. The lantern burned on, indifferent. Aqyl had wandered to a far shelf and
was reading spines with that almond–lidded, not–young, not–old look of his, as if time had to ask
to count him.
“Edges,” he said without looking, “will speak like thresholds if you let them. Keep your sums. Keep
your breath.” Then, quieter: “If something answers, mark what it took to answer.”
The page under my hand bore a penciled note in a small, precise script: ford held. Beside it,
three tiny triangles where tallies should have been. The dust along the table had drifted into a
narrow crescent, and I could not tell whether my sleeve had done that, or some older, larger shape
remembering how to fold itself.
I copied the note, and the ring, and the triangles, and left a line unfilled at the top of the page, as
Father taught me, for whatever will not be named yet.
Earlier hand (648 AR), Lexicus of Thepyrgos, Junior Reader
Amber Reckoning: Planting, Tenday II, Day 6 (648 AR)
Master Aqyl this day entrusted to me the study he keeps behind the north stalls, being tired (so he
says) of carrying the key. He maintains that the first of his name bequeathed it to his house, yet
would have it now employed by any who will keep a neat margin. I am resolved to be that man.
4
On a middle shelf I found a tract whose outer leaves show a curious stain, as though pressed with
damp salt. The title is rubbed, but within there is set down a custom of the Cartwright before
any game: he traces a light band of salt about the board’s perimeter and speaks nothing until his
first piece is moved. The writer names this the Salt Stitch, and cites an earlier fragment styled the
Salt–Pressed Leaves (whatever that may mean). The habit is treated as a warding: not a wall, but
a price.
I cannot yet say whether this is superstition or discipline. The Cartwright is elsewhere a practical
man. Yet I confess the figure pleases the mind. To bind the outermost ring and thus make the
middle honest—do we not do as much in our books when we rule a margin?
Present marginal hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood: Same tract, same page; the ring–mark survives. I
asked Aqyl, son of Aqyl what to call it. He watched me read and said nothing until I closed the
book. Then: “Name nothing yet. Learn its weight first.” (It is a good line; I am trying to like it less
because he knows it.)
2.3 Fragment L–3 (648 AR / 876 AR) — Ash–Fenn, Tolls, and Wagered Dreams
Provenance. A toll–ledger leaf (rubbed, smoke–tinged) copied verbatim with notes by Lexicus of
Thepyrgos (648 AR); two later journal leaves by M. Fenwood (876 AR) were bound after it by a
University custodian.
Earlier hand (648 AR), Lexicus of Thepyrgos, Junior Reader
In the north case I found a ledger of border dues, the hand plain as a bricklayer’s rule. One entry
pricked my eye:
“Ash–Fenn caravan: from the east. Twenty–three beasts, seven wagons. Paid in full at Wadi
Gate; stamped at the ford. Next gate: —” (blank) “Reason for pass–through: —” (blank).
Strange that a caravan so noted should vanish between gates; stranger that the clerk left two fields
unfilled. I have marked three other leaves where the same name appears, always “from the east,”
always tidy in its sums, and then silence—as though the road itself declined to witness.
I do not yet comprehend Master Aqyl’s interest in such mundane books. He maintains that the
ordinary page is a faithful mirror if one looks long enough; I am young and wish for brighter glass.
Turning the leaf, a loose scrap fell from the binding—a toll–keeper’s own hand, crowded and eager,
likely written after hours:
“They were cheerful, the Ash–Fenn lot, and asked if I would sit a friendly game of Canray while
the beasts drank. We wagered dreams, which I thought a country jest. I am not a superstitious
man. I lost and bid them on their way. Curious thing is, I dreamt poorly after—a month’s turn
of it—and woke as if I had borrowed someone else’s night.”
If this be a town humor, it is an odd one; yet the phrase “wagering dreams” reappears in a margin
later in the book, in another hand. Perhaps it is a manner of speaking for small stakes without
coin. I will ask Master Aqyl whether the phrase has a history, or whether the clerk merely wished
to write himself interesting.
The ring–stamps are neat; the gaps are neater. I begin to suspect that the absence of a mark can
carry as much account as the presence.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood

I took the sliver of metal that is not quite a key and went to the door with the Wardens’ stencil.
The notice was still there; paper does not mind being outranked. I chose the lock. The ward turned
with a soft, professional disappointment, and the oak came free on a breath of chalk and old rain.
I crossed the threshold. No one asked me to. I wrote my name, small, on the blotting pad by the
lantern to make the act answerable later. Then I shut the door behind me and let the room keep its
own weather.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
I have gone back to the little study three days running. It is an alluring room—not for comfort,
which it refuses, but for the hush that gathers there like felt. I tell myself it is the quiet I am after.
On the day I kept away (work, and a sore head), I slept oddly: too many doors, not enough rooms;
a corridor that turned of its own accord and returned me to a threshold I had not crossed. It is
nothing, I am sure. Still, I ledger it, as the toll–keeper ledgered his: not for drama, but to see if the
numbers begin to lean.
Aqyl has not asked where I am reading; I have not told him. He warned me to read heresies without
letting them read me. I do not yet know the test, except this: stop when the ink begins to feel
warm in the hand, as if the page were remembering a voice. (Last night it did; I set the book down
and waited until the warmth went out of it like breath on a pane.)
The ash keeps turning up. Not a fall you can see, but a taste—chalk, a little iron—and a grit that
will not be brushed. Ash–Fenn recurs. Always “from the east.” Always counted, then—after some
neat total—uncounted. Accounts that conclude and then tilt, as if something leaned upon the last
line and the clerk, to be prudent, looked away. If there is a trick in the books, it is a careful trick.
If there is none, then it is only a habit of a careful man and I am lending it more weight than it
earns. Either way, absences are a kind of ink.
There is also this, which I do not think I will tell Aqyl: when I read too long the lamp begins to
sound like a drum in a room down the hall, and in the corner of my eye a shadow learns to be tall. I
look and there is nothing—only the two chairs and their crossed shadows, meeting like folded wings.
Perhaps my head is not yet right. Perhaps the University is very old and remembers how to be
solemn.
Tomorrow I will copy the three blanks: the clerk’s three unprinted cells that fall where the sums
should touch. I will copy them exactly, in their silence, and I will set them in a row to see if their
emptiness makes a pattern—or if, turned, they prefer to be a circle.
2.4 Fragment L–4 (648 AR / 876 AR) — The Burning at Ash–Fenn
Provenance. An unsigned, trembling report (original leaf smoke–soft, brine–scented), copied in full
by Lexicus of Thepyrgos (648 AR); later marginal notes by M. Fenwood (876 AR).
Earlier hand (648 AR), Lexicus of Thepyrgos, Junior Reader
In a pasteboard folder marked only by a tally, I found a narrow leaf, the ink run as if laid under
breath. It purports to be an eye–witness account of the Burning at Ash–Fenn, the writer’s name
withheld. I copy the opening as it stands, preserving both ornament and hesitation:
“We came upon the caravan after the bell. The charge was heresy against the Light. I will not
set down the tale of it, for the deeds done and the words spoken by the dying are a weight I will
6
not lend to the world. I write only that ash fell like a fine rain, and that the road kept no prints
though many passed.
As I turned to go, I heard voices speaking in a tongue I do not know, though I know many. They
were not commands, only tellings, as if a steady hand turned a ledger and asked me to read
aloud. They said, ‘Bring it to your mentor, Aqyl.’ They said, ‘He will weigh it.’ I took fear then
and fled for Thepyrgos with this account, meaning to place it in his hands and wash mine.”
The next lines (ink paler; hand appears the same) read as if added on the following day:
“I found Aqyl much aged and asked leave to lay the leaf before him. He called for his son—also
Aqyl—to sit and witness. The elder’s eye watered but did not wander. He said, ‘Read what you
can, hide what you must.’ The younger set a lamp between us and did not speak.”
I suspend judgment, noting only that my breath shortened while copying. The corridor outside
the study was quiet; yet beneath the quiet there seemed a soft speech, like cloth moved in the next
room. Twice I set down my pen and began again.
Note to self. If this be heresy, it wears the dress of accounts and receipts. If it be only panic on a
wet night, why does the ink fall heaviest where the writer says wash mine? Cf. toll leaves, Ash–Fenn
entries; viz. gaps that carry meaning.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
I am not proud to write that this piece spooked me. Two nights now with poor sleep. Nothing
elaborate: only the thin sort of whispering that lives at the edge of hearing, as if a page were being
turned in the next room and the reader very careful not to be seen. And (last night) a slow drum I
could not place—one beat, then a long breath, then another—like a procession keeping time for a
road that never delivers its pilgrims.
This morning I went back to the study and read the lines about the elder and the younger sitting
together by the lamp. The picture steadies me: two faces sharing one circle of light, one hand
turning the leaf, the other learning how to wait. If there is a lesson in that, it is not cleverness but
patience.
Aqyl says a ledger is kept one entry at a time—numbers first, sums when they are due. I will keep
mine that way and not make a story before it permits one. Today’s entry: the whispering is softer
by daylight; the drum is not heard at all—save that when I lay awake and counted my breath, last
night’s beat matched it, patiently. I held my breath to shame my nerves and the beat withheld
itself, just as patiently, until I breathed again.
The chairs kept their shadows, crossing like folded wings at the floor. There was also a gleam in the
corner I had not noticed—a little crescent, no more than a sliver of damp where the dust refuses
to settle. Perhaps only the lamp’s trick. Perhaps a ring that remembers a vessel. I touched the
page and it felt cool, as if something had been lifted from it in the night and the paper had not yet
warmed to the room.
Present marginal hand, small. If the road kept no prints, look to the fords. If the ash fell like rain,
look to the wind.

2.5 Fragment L–5 (648 AR / 876 AR) — On Ionius and the Witness at the
Ford
Provenance. A translated note by Lexicus of Thepyrgos (648 AR) from an older Thepyrgosi account;
later, a journal leaf by M. Fenwood (876 AR). The source leaf shows rubrication on the name Ionius
and a faint waterline along the lower margin.
Earlier hand (648 AR), Lexicus of Thepyrgos, Junior Reader
This day I translated a fragment from our city’s older tongue, being the recollection of a youth
who attached himself to the Cartwright on account of his instruction in ordered play (styled in the
margin Canré). At the first the lessons are entirely proper: patience; the advantage of plain records;
speaking only what one can justify by the state of the board.
As the company about the Cartwright increased, the account darkens. The youth writes of fast–day
vigils; of circling the board’s rim with damp salt; of speaking as little as possible between first and
fifth moves, as though silence itself were a counting. He calls these observances rites and protests
they were harmless while few.
Then follows a passage I set down in the driest manner and omit for decency’s sake all but its figure.
The youth names a man Ionius (the name is rubricated twice in the source) and says he was given
at a ford beyond the east gate, under lanterns and in the rain. This is described not as punishment
but as analogy enacted: Ionius, the witness at the ford. Those present were instructed to watch the
water take him and to keep silence until dawn. After, the Cartwright declared their crossings would
henceforth be priced more honestly.
Whether the youth’s pen makes theatre of a lesser cruelty I cannot say. Yet the recurrence of salt,
silence, and ford troubles me. I am, to my shame, intrigued by the claim that an emblem, if lived,
might impose measure upon those who prefer cleverness to clarity. I record the temptation here, so
that I may rebuke it later.
Translator’s note (L.). The idiom witness at the ford appears again on two unrelated leaves with
the sense of a boundary made costly, that crossings be not squandered. The scribe’s double–red on
Ionius is unusual in civic accounts.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
This is where I ought to have stopped for the week. I am unsettled by Lexicus’s cool pen in the face
of what he copies, and more unsettled by his plain confession that he was intrigued. I was, for a
moment, the same. Then I shut the book with two hands, as if it were a window and the night were
at it.
I set this down to bind myself: a rule, not a mood. I will not go back to that little room again. The
shelves with their patient dust, the cobweb banners, the salt rings that print themselves anew if
you breathe too near, the way the margins begin to hum when the lantern bends low—none of it is
good for sleep or sums. There is a warmth that belongs to bread and hands; there is another that
belongs to the inside of a bell. The leaves have the latter.
If anything worth keeping lies in those copies, I will fetch it in daylight, with witnesses, and with
less romance than I have lately allowed. The University is large enough to house both scholarship
and appetite; I will give mine back its leash.
8
Tomorrow I will take my notes in the public stalls and leave the key where it lies. I have brushed
the dust from my sleeves and yet an ash–smell clings, like metal after thunder. Perhaps only the
lamp. Perhaps the room remembering me. I choose to be dull and careful. Let whatever wants
answering knock on a door with a porter.
Present marginal hand (small). The name Ionius rang an old shelf–bell I cannot place. Perhaps
only the house remembering its own books.
2.6 Fragment L–6 (648 AR / 876 AR) — On Sacred Geometry and a Sleepless
Study
Provenance. A nocturnal journal leaf by M. Fenwood (876 AR), bound with an earlier notebook
entry by Lexicus of Thepyrgos (648 AR) concerning a stitched slip titled “Sacred Geometry.” The
later leaf shows graphite pricking in groups of three and eight; the earlier carries stitch–holes at its
head.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
Amber Reckoning: Leafturn, late, 876 AR
I meant to keep away.
Instead I woke in the little study with my cheek on a folio, the lantern guttering low and the dust
making constellations of my sleeves. The wick had tunneled; the oil was nearly spent. I could not
have said how I came there. I sat up, prepared to be unnerved, and yet what rose in me was its
opposite: the surety that I was precisely where I ought to be, doing the thing my hands had learned
without waiting for my consent.
The folio bore a faint ring again—a pale halo on the paper, as if a vessel had stood there and cooled
the room around it. Grains like salt pricked my fingertips. On the blotting sheet beside it my own
pencil had been at work: a row of small marks in threes and eights, a space left carefully blank,
then three more. I do not remember writing them. The marks looked patient, as if they had been
counting something until I arrived to finish it.
There was a second light that did not belong to the lantern, a cold awareness behind my shoulder
that made my shadow double for a breath and then agree with itself again. In that same moment
the air lifted along my neck with the suggestion—not more than that—of feathers in passage. The
rafters kept their cobweb banners; nothing moved that I could name.
The page lay open to a margin in Lexicus’s quick pencil. Nothing dramatic—only a question mark
set beside a figure and the line, “Name nothing yet.” The words felt correctly placed, like a hand
flattening a wrinkle. I closed the book and listened. The room kept its own breath: a long hush, a
soft return. Somewhere, far inside the walls, a slow drum counted to eight and declined to count
the next.

Someweeksaftermylast, Idiscoveredavery smalltractstitchedintothebackofasermon–book—the
hand uneasy, the vellum thin, the title in a timid red: a fragment of Sacred Geometry. Much of it
is crabbed and obscure; yet one sentence pierces: that certain men hold Canré to be more than
pastime; that its figures are forms of address; that a board, rightly attended, is a prayer laid flat.
9
I carried the slip at once to Aqyl, son of Aqyl. He read three lines, returned it to my palm, and
said—kindly rather than sharp: “Return it where you found it. Fragments torn from their bindings
make liars of both sides.” He regarded me a moment longer than comfort requires. “Are you sleeping,
Lexicus? You have the look of a man who counts when he should be at rest.”
I answered that I was well (not the truth entire) and promised to replace the fragment. This I have
done. The sentence about a prayer laid flat does not release me. I set it here under witness so that
I may put it away later, cf. fast–day cautions; viz. the elder’s maxim on plain work before bright
theories.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
Amber Reckoning: Leafturn, following morning, 876 AR
This room has been too easy to find of late. The corridors that used to wind now come right, as if
the stone had learned my steps and meant to be obliging. I am spending more hours here than at
my other work and have begun to fall behind in the ordinary reading; the tidy stacks look at me
with the patience of scolded cats.
Yesterday I met Aqyl, son of Aqyl on the stair. He paused one tread above, the light cutting his
cheek into two ages at once, and asked only: “Are you sleeping?” I said I was (which was not
the truth entire). He considered me a heartbeat, almond eyes unkind to excuses, and said, “Eat
something warm. Read in the public stalls for a night or two, where the lamps are bright and the
bells keep time.” Then he went on, weighing spines in his head the way other men weigh bread; his
thumb touched the rail eight times and declined a ninth without seeming to notice.
I write this in the morning to leave a mark I can see from elsewhere. If I do not come back for a
day and the dreams return, I will count that as weather and not as instruction. Let the whispering
be wind in the flues; let the slow drum belong to the clockworks; let the cold at the nape be only
the hall breathing. If it is more, it has yet to learn my name; I will not teach it.
There is a faint grit on the page even now, though I wiped the desk last night—salt, or ash, or only
old paper refusing to be new. I will keep to the bright lamps until this settles. If it does not settle,
I will bring witnesses, and we will see whether the room keeps its breath when it is made to share.
2.7 Fragment L–7 (648 AR / 876 AR) — Fairy Stones and the Unnamed Ninth
Provenance: a Theonan folio rendered into our speech by Lexicus (648 AR); later, a journal leaf by
M. Fenwood (876 AR). The island script is angular and spare; several lines are smoke–nibbled at
the edges.
Earlier hand (648 AR), Lexicus of Thepyrgos, Junior Reader
Amber Reckoning: Planting, Tenday III, Day 2 (648 AR)
This afternoon I translated a small account from Theona, the eastern isle. The writer calls his
subject a game, but refuses its proper title. He writes:
“We will not speak the true name among strangers; in the market we say only Fairy Stones. If
you would learn it, you must swear to leave one seat empty and one turn uncounted.”
The same folio assembles, with little ceremony, several island notions our city delights to mock:
giants that eat the flesh of the drowned; doorways that will not open if you name them; the
unholiness of the number nine. The author notes that fishers count their nets in eights and set aside
10
the ninth rope as ward; that at winter feasts the ninth cup is poured and left; that tollmen on the
south road strike eight neat notches, then make a faint scratch for the ninth and look away.
It is a thin piece and not well argued, yet it holds together like the ribs of a small boat. Refusal to
name; leaving empty; fear of nine—these seem of a kind. If there is a custom beneath it, it is not
new.
Lexicus’s margin. Our city keeps its own small reverences (who does not leave the first line clear
on a new page?) and pretends they are accidents of neatness. Theonans do not pretend. Whether
Fairy Stones masks a better name or merely a truer one, I cannot yet say.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
Walking back from the study I found myself humming. I do not know the tune. It keeps to itself,
low and patient, as if it wished to be a rope rather than a song. When I sat down, the words came
without asking. I set them here so I can see what my hand did:
Eight steps to water, one left behind;
eight stones in a circle, one will not bind.
Say nothing at thresholds; name nothing at doors.
If you must cross, count softly:
one for the keeper, one for the ford,
one for the watcher who will not be stored.
Leave a cup poured; leave a chair bare.
What you do not call by its name
cannot answer your prayer.
I do not recall ever hearing this. Perhaps it is only a trick of tiredness, the mind laying boards
across a ditch. Still, the number keeps returning. I write it in the bright part of the day, where I
can look at it and decide later whether it is only weather.
Later, on the west stair, I met Aqyl, son of Aqyl. He was coming up softly, thumb and forefinger
tapping the rail: eight light touches and then a pause that did not quite become a ninth. He said
nothing at first, but as we passed I heard him answer my tune under his breath—no more than a
thread of it, a low second that seemed to know where the line would turn before I did. When he
noticed my listening he smiled the way one does at a child’s rhyme and said, “Old border thing.
Market noise. Eat something warm.” His almond eyes had a weight I could not count. He touched
the newel once, as if to number it too, and went on.
If the mind makes its own songs, let it make this one. The lamps are bright; the bells keep time; and
though the words sit oddly on the page, they sit well in the mouth. Oh well—it is a pretty ballad.
2.8 Fragment L–8 (648 AR / 876 AR) — A Dream of Sacred Geometry
Provenance: a night–note by Lexicus (648 AR) concerning a vivid dream; a later journal leaf by M.
Fenwood (876 AR). The Lexican page is blotched as if written upon waking.
Earlier hand (648 AR), Lexicus of Thepyrgos, Junior Reader
I woke before the bell with my hand already moving. The dream would not keep still unless I pinned
it with ink.
11
I saw a plane laid out with lines that were not lines but bindings, faint as breath on glass. The
figure arranged itself by preference rather than command: eight regions that received the eye and
a ninth that refused it, as if the page were shy of being complete. Around the outermost I felt a
coolness, like damp salt drying to a ring.
There was a rhythm underneath (do not laugh at this), not music but the sense that a step awaited
a step, and that speech would be in the way of it. In the middle space—if I may call it middle—I
tried to set a small mark to test whether the figure were mine to disturb. The mark slid of its own
accord to a neighboring place and would not abide where I had first wished it. I was not afraid,
exactly. I was glad to be contradicted by something that kept its own account, and then, right after,
ashamed to have felt glad.
I drew three little copies when I sat up. The first two are nothing but nets. The third preserves a
hint of the ninth—an unwritable hollow that makes the eights honest. I am excited by this and
concerned in equal measure. If I am not careful I will begin to prefer the neatness of the emblem to
the disorder of persons. This is a warning to myself to eat, to speak to someone, and to read plainer
books for a day.
Lexicus’s margin, later the same morning: The phrase Sacred geometry comes too easily to the
tongue when one has slept poorly.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
Last night I dreamt of shapes that would not settle. Nothing theatrical—only angles arriving where
I meant curves, and a narrow gap my eye kept walking around as if a low fence stood there, polite
and immovable. I am calling it the power of suggestion. If you read long enough about circles, you
dream circles. If you spend too long copying talk of an unwelcome ninth, the mind obliges with a
hollow.
Still, I ledger what I remember, so it can live with weather and not with omens: a sense of counting
without numbers; a coolness that laid itself along the edge of things like a ribbon; the feeling
that silence itself had learned to be a kind of measure. Once, I thought I heard a bell mark the
hour—eight strokes, then a patient pause that did not consent to be the next.
Today I will keep to the bright stalls, do the ordinary work, and eat something warm. If the shapes
follow me into daylight, I will call that proof it is not the room but the hour, and I will sleep earlier.
My thumb and forefinger have begun to tap railings without asking—eight light touches and then a
breath. A habit, surely. If it becomes anything else, I will write it down and call it weather again.
2.9 Fragment L–9 (876 AR) — A Package from Constano: On the Twin–Oases
Provenance: a bundle posted from C. Fenwood to M. Fenwood, containing family letters and working
notes on Canré. One leaf bears a penciled header, “Twin–Oases,” struck through in a later hand.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
This afternoon a parcel arrived from my brother Constano: old correspondence, a sheaf of copies,
and two brittle offcuts shaved, by the look, from a larger draft of the Concordance. He writes:
“Found these in the black trunk from the east room. Mostly letters. Two leaves look like Papa’s
working pages. One is headed Twin–Oases. The header’s scored out, but the notes underneath
12
are tidy. If they’re yours by right, keep them. If not, return them to the trunk and pretend I
never sent this.”
The Twin–Oases leaf is not an opening so much as a shape: two opposite edges taking the part of
wells, the middle kept shallow for a time, the hand taught to move as if water were dear. It is a way
of beginning that prices thirst. In the margin, in my father’s small pencil:
“This feels like a rite, not an opening. Disturbing. It teaches the crossing rather than the play.”
I do not quite understand his unease. The figure reads as sensible to me: two “wets” to balance
want, a hush at the start to make the first steps honest, a rim circled not as a wall but as a reminder
to step carefully. If a beginning can teach restraint, is that not a lesson worth keeping?
It unsettles me that it does not unsettle me.
Constano’s note smells of the cedar box; Papa’s pencil is faint enough that I must angle the page to
catch it. The header truly is scored out with care, not temper—three light strokes, even, as though
someone were hiding a candle rather than putting out a fire. In the scored place, if you run a finger
very gently, the paper dips like a shallow cup. On the verso someone has begun a count, neat as
rails: one two three four five six seven eight—then a courteous space—and again one. It looks like
practice; it feels like permission.
I will ask Aqyl, son of Aqyl whether he has seen this heading and why it was moved quietly to a
drawer. (On the south landing today I thought I heard him hum a low second to a tune I could not
quite place; his thumb tapped the rail—eight, and then a polite pause.) For now I am copying both
leaves exactly as they are and returning the originals to the parcel. If Constano asks, I will tell him
they are safer in his cedar than in my desk.
There is a dry taste at the back of the mouth as I write this, like chalk that remembers rain. When
I set the copy aside, a pale damp ring ghosted the blotting paper and then faded. I tell myself it is
nothing but the press of my cup. I will keep saying so until it is true.
2.10 Fragment L–10 (648 AR / 876 AR) — On the House of Wells and the
Witness
Provenance: a stitched quire of uneven leaves in Lexicus’s hand (648 AR), ink crowded and overwarm
at the margins; followed by a brief journal entry by M. Fenwood (876 AR). The quire’s thread is
brittle and smells faintly of oil and salt.
Earlier hand (648 AR), Lexicus of Thepyrgos, Junior Reader
I will set down, at length, the structure as I now see it, that I may not lose the thread when the
lamps gutter.
First: the House of Wells. Their ledgers are proud of being plain, yet the plainness is a garment. I
find small clippings of value (copper shaved thin) recurring on days when ring–stamps are heavy; I
find toll slips entered twice, once as road–duty and again as benefaction. The difference is small
enough to pass a sleepy audit, large enough to carry a habit along for years.
Second: the circle that names itself the Witness. They do not write minutes; they write margins.
Where the Cartwright teaches a careful beginning and a price for crossing, these copyists preach a
crossing that watches back. See the phrases recurring: ford held; silence is counted; salt binds the
rim. See also the practice of leaving one line unmarked and calling it kept for the missing place.
13
Third: the junction of the two. In the Wells books, I mark chits stamped with triangles where
coins should be; in the Witness margins, I mark triangles where tallies should be. The same hand?
Two hands that learned from one teacher? I cannot yet prove it, but the drift is toward a cult of
accountancy: that the world may be kept honest by making its thresholds costly. If it were only a
philosophy, I would applaud. If it is a church, I am afraid.
There are voices in the next room.
They are not speaking to me exactly; they are answering a question I have not asked, or have asked
too softly. I set down an argument to quiet them:
1. If a rule is just, it will stand in daylight.
2. If a rite requires secrecy, it is either childish theatre or theft.
3. The Cartwright wrote to teach play, not to purchase souls.
4. Therefore the Witness, if born of him, is a bastard child.
The voices are not convinced. I could go into the next room and demand names, but that would
break the frame of the work. I will not break the frame. The page is my room; the margin is my
door; the door will stay shut until the figure shows itself without my calling.
Lexicus’s margin, later: If this be madness, let it at least be ruled madness. I will keep my sums
straight even as my breath runs.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
I asked Aqyl, son of Aqyl this morning, outright, whether there was ever a Cult of the Witness. A
new frown gathered—small, exact, like a net drawn tight. He said only:
“There are places in this University that are not secrets, and yet they are best left alone. Stay
out of that room. Read where the bells can scold you. If a thing is worth keeping, it does not
need you to whisper to it.”
I said I understood. I am not sure I do. I have written the warning here so that I must step over it
if I ignore it.
When we parted at the stair, his thumb tapped the rail—eight light touches and then a pause that
refused to become the next. He did not seem to notice. As he turned away he hummed two notes
that found my earlier tune and held it under breath, like a thread tucked into a seam. I do not
think he lied. I do not think he told me everything.
2.11 Fragment L–11 (876 AR) — The Veil of Names and the Closed Door
Provenance: an elated but unsteady note in the hand of Lexicus, dated “—12 AR” in a later pencil
(catalogers dispute the obscured digit); paired with a present-day leaf by M. Fenwood (876 AR).
Earlier hand (650 AR), Lexicus of Thepyrgos, Junior Reader
I have it. I have it, or the edge of it: the Veil of Names is not a cipher of letters but a conduct. One
does not name in certain rooms; one leaves the first line empty; one signs with a figure that is not
one’s own. The grace of it is to keep the breath from preening. The danger is that a mask, worn for
clarity, will begin to think for the face beneath.
14
For three nights my steps in sleep have brought me to a door I do not know by day. I describe
it so that haste will not trick me: oak, swollen a little with damp; three iron straps across, three
down, their crossings each stopped with a small rosette; the heads of those rosettes are pin–pricked
around so that, taken together, they suggest a ring of salt–flowers. There is no handle. The keyhole
is long, almond–shaped, with a tiny chip lifted from its lower lip. The sill shows a pale crust as if
something had dried there and been poorly swept.
Behind it, chanting. Not commands—keepings. The syllables fold over one another like cloth; I
know none of the words except the word I am not to say.
I woke with my hand on the wall beside my bed, palm flat as if feeling for the grain of the oak. I
am giddy with the nearness of it and sick with the same. If I open it (there must be a way, for why
else the keyhole?), I will break the work. The Veil says: do not name until the crossing is priced.
So I will not name; I will keep the first line empty; I will count aloud over ordinary things and write
what I can prove.
Lexicus’s margin, cramped: The door is a sentence. To open it is to finish the line before it earns its
period.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
A voice in last night’s dream said, very plainly, “Not yet. Do not show what you have. The time is
not right.” Then, as if offering a kindness: “Do not trust Aqyl, son of Aqyl.”
Writing it now, in daylight, I dislike the taste of those sentences. They are not like my thoughts,
nor like Aqyl’s speech. They sit too cleanly, as if cut from a slate and pressed under my door. I
put them here so they must survive the morning to trouble me; that is a higher bar than a dream
deserves.
If I were sensible I would call this suggestion and fatigue. Read enough leaves in one voice and you
begin to think in it; sleep too little and the mind supplies a chorus to save you the labor of deciding.
Still, the little room keeps tugging at my sleeve, and the hour keeps slipping its buttons. I have not
told Aqyl about the parcel from Constano or the two cut leaves. I do not like that I am keeping two
ledgers—one for the day, one for the door.
I will eat something warm, sit in the bright stalls, and speak of none of this page for a day. If the
voice returns, it can make its case again—and I will hear it against the bells. If I am lucky, the bells
will win. If I am not, then I will at least have counted how many times the hour refuses to step
beyond eight.
As I closed the notebook a grit came off on my thumb—salt, or ash, or only old paper remembering
weather. In the corridor the porter’s clock struck eight, then paused, obedient as a dog at a threshold.
On the stair below, someone hummed two low notes and let the third go missing.
2.12 Fragment L–12 (650 AR / 876 AR) — The Teacher, Copper & Salt, and
the Door
Provenance: two entries in Lexicus’s hand (first and “weeks later,” 650 AR) concerning a tutor of
the Cartwright’s discipline; followed by a present–day leaf by M. Fenwood (876 AR).
Earlier hand (650 AR), Lexicus of Thepyrgos, Junior Reader — first meeting
15
I sought out a teacher reputed to keep the Cartwright’s strategy in the old, spare way. We sat at a
plain table. Before a word, he drew a narrow ring of damp salt about the board’s edge and set his
hands in his lap. When he finally spoke, it was in code, as though discussing tariffs:
“Some crossings are priced. Some vows are better kept unnamed. A watcher keeps his ledger
without boasting.”
I answered that I knew of the vow he would not name, and (here I confess my rashness) that I
had dreamt of a door—oak, rosettes set at each crossing, no handle—behind which men chant not
commands but keepings. His eyes changed, not with anger but with a kind of inventory.
“You are before your hour,” he said at last. “When you can beat me clean at Canré, you will be
ready to be shown what cannot be said.”
We began to play.
Earlier hand (650 AR), Lexicus — weeks later
After many sessions, and more losses than I care to number, I kept a steady book and at last defeated
him—no cleverness, only the calm of counted breath. He did not sulk. He beckoned me close and
spoke in a tongue I have not studied but understood, as if my thought were already arranged to
receive it.
He called it the Rite of Copper and Salt. A fragment of his utterance (set here without its cadence):
Copper before threshold, salt upon rim;
price what is entered, bind what is thin.
Count what is taken, count what you spare;
open what answers, and leave the rest bare.
It is only logical. Of course it is. Copper to mark what is dear; salt to make the edge honest; silence
to value speech. He told me to come at dusk on the third day. “Bring no one,” he said. “The door
you know will be open for those who have earned its measure.”
I am writing with a fast hand. The page feels too narrow for the hour.
Lexicus’s margin, later that night: The figure fits. I am not afraid. I am ready. (I am also not
sleeping.)
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
I found the hall by accident, or so I tell myself. The corridor is the sort that collects notices and
forgets them: flaking paint, old stencils, a buckled runner that remembers more feet than names.
But the door—the door—was not like its corridor. The oak looked newly rubbed; the iron rosettes
were clean as coins. On the sill, a fine pale crust had been pushed aside lately, not well, leaving a
half–moon ridge like surf that never learned to retreat.
There was a shallow scratch on the strike, bright as a breath. I set my palm to the wood and felt
it cool, not cold—the cool of a vessel that has been emptied but not yet put away. For a breath
(mine, I hope) I heard a low line of chanting, the sort that lives under the world like a seam and
hums whether you deserve it or not. Then the lamps along the hall took a stutter together, and the
sound—if there was a sound—drew thin as thread and tucked itself into the grain.
The air smelled of iron and damp feathers. A draft rose from under the threshold and laid itself
along the bones of my hand as if counting them. In the lacquer of the nearest rosette I saw a small
16
ring of light where no lamp stood; it widened, narrowed, and waited. I did not try the keyhole. I
did not knock. I stood and counted to eight and left before my right foot could choose the next.
On the landing below I found my breath again, and with it the tune. I was humming without
meaning to. Someone on the stair above—light step, patient—took a low second to it and let the
third go missing. When I looked up there was no one there. Only the lamps, now steady, and a
long shadow that decided to be two and then agreed to be one.
I have written this quickly and without sum. I am going to the bright stalls to eat something warm.
I will leave this page open on the desk and see whether the dust settles evenly. If it does not, I will
call that weather. If it settles in a circle, I will close the book with both hands and sleep with the
bells.
2.13 Fragment L–13 (650 AR / 876 AR) — On the Missing Count and the
Remaining
Provenance: a fervent note in Lexicus’s hand (650 AR), edges rubbed; paired with a present–day
journal leaf by M. Fenwood (876 AR). The older leaf shows pressure–marks where the pen bit; the
newer smells faintly of lamp oil.
Earlier hand (650 AR), Lexicus of Thepyrgos, Junior Reader
The step beyond eight—they curse it so upon the eastern isle and will not number it aloud. My new
companions are much the same. But in Dhahara that same count is Sacred. Their doctors speak of
messengers, pillars that keep the world square; others, more careful, speak of the Remaining. They
do not say from what they remain. The courtesy is deliberate; it is a price paid in silence. I listen; I
learn; and as I learn the figure stands straighter in the mind.
It is not a cipher of letters. It is a use. Leave the first line empty. Count to eight and bind the rim.
Refuse the next until the crossing is priced. Do this, and the room answers without your naming it.
I can see it now. I can see it. The same hush the Theonan comforters fear is the hush the Dhaharan
expositors bless.
The habit enters the hand before it enters the reason. This is a confession; this is also a method. I
will keep both ledgers: one that says plainly what is done; one that leaves space for what answers
back. They must not trade places. (Write this again when the lamps waver.)
Lexicus’s margin, compressed: If the missing count is a wound to some and a seal to others, the
work is to learn which it is before speaking. Pride ruins sums; hunger ruins silence.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
Third night in a row with the corridor. This time the door was open. Without ceremony—simply
open, as if openness were its natural state and my memory the error. The room beyond was dark
the way a street is dark when the lamps are not yet lit: not empty, only unwilling to be of use.
Mid–dream I thought I ought to be unnerved. I was not. I stood at the threshold and felt a cool
draft from within, the kind of air that has traveled long along stone. It smelt faintly of iron and old
rain. I did not step through. I woke with my hand lifted, fingers spaced as if to learn the grain of
the jamb.
17
I am calling this a recurring dream and blaming it on pattern–seeking. Read enough about doors
and one will open to oblige you. Still, ledgering helps. I counted eight heartbeats at the sill before
waking; the next went missing of its own accord. Somewhere—this is foolish, but I write it—the
faintest hum held a low second and declined the third.
If tomorrow’s version invites me in, let this daylight hand stand here like a porter on the page, and
make me pause.
2.14 Fragment L–14 (653 AR / 876 AR) — The Ash–Fenn Rite and the Candles
Provenance: an exultant, overfull entry in Lexicus’s hand (653 AR) recording his formal induction;
paired with a present–day leaf by M. Fenwood (876 AR). The older page is salted at one edge; the
newer leaf is clean but for a pale ring on the blotter.
Earlier hand (653 AR), Lexicus of Thepyrgos, Junior Reader
Tonight they taught me the Ash–Fenn Rite. I am bid not to name its steps in the open book; I am
permitted to set down that it is a keeping, a pricing, a remembering. Copper placed in my palm; a
ribbon circled my wrists, touched to salt and to water. The words were not the teacher’s alone—the
room made them easy, as if I had been rehearsing them unawares.
I am—let the sentence stand—I am ecstatic. Not with noise, but with the swift quiet that runs
under the ribs. I am to learn and record what I can prove; to keep the first line empty and the last
line honest; to be no one’s cleverness; to be a witness.
They say the circle grew from the Cartwright’s discipline and took its charge from the burning east
of the gates. They say the Rite binds a wound without boasting of the scar. I believe them. I see it:
thresholds priced so crossings are not squandered; silence given its measure; the rim made true so
the middle may be merciful.
Henceforth I will keep two ledgers: one for daylight and one for the room. They do not contradict;
they converse. If there is danger, it is that the night–book will begin to think for the day. I will not
allow it. (Write this like a charm; perhaps it is one.)
Lexicus’s margin, crowded: The Ash, the Fenn; the salt, the copper. Penance and price. I am steady.
I am steady. I am steady.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
I walked to the door again. I told myself I was only confirming the corridor. The oak was cool
under my palm—the sort of cool that lives a little deeper than the surface, as if the wood kept a
private weather. I set my ear to the seam to be clever and bought myself a headache that bloomed
behind the right eye, not sharp, only insistent, like a finger laid there and asked to stay. I stepped
back and laughed at myself in the empty hall, which made the place feel less empty. The laugh
came back late, from somewhere farther in than the walls should allow.
That night I dreamt the room beyond. There was a table and candles set about it—not a crowd,
not a feast, only a shape made of light. I counted them before I could think not to: eight small
flames keeping company, and another that preferred to be a cup of oil. I woke with the number
sitting in my mouth like a word I am not yet permitted to say.
18
This is a record, not a vow. Tomorrow I will read where the bells can scold me and let the door be
wood again. I will eat something warm and keep to the bright stalls. If the room wants more than
that, it can knock where a porter listens.
2.15 Fragment L–15 (654 AR / 876 AR) — The Ninth and the Open Room
Provenance: a scorched leaf in Lexicus’s hand (654 AR), edges singed and brittle; paired with a
present–day entry by M. Fenwood (876 AR). The older ink is hurried and overbold; the newer bears
a pale salt grit in the gutter.
Earlier hand (654 AR), Lexicus of Thepyrgos, Junior Reader
They have taught me The Ninth. I am commanded to speak it only in keeping, and I have obeyed.
I have burned the day–book. I do not repent it. A book that cannot keep a vow is worse than no
book at all.
I will set the shape in code, for code is a fence that lets the field breathe:
Leave the first line empty. Bind the rim with what bites the tongue.
Count crossings as prices, not as boasts.
When the word that is not said is ready to be said, speak it once and only once.
Then, for one breath, unmake the binding you have made.
Do not spend that breath on cleverness; spend it on measure.
Close the book before the smoke names you.
It is clear. It is clear. For one breath a keeping may be set aside—not to cheat, but to seal. The
wound is named; the rim is cracked and made true again. I know the word. I will not write it. The
page would not carry it without bending.
The room received me. The door did not resist. The watchers keep no faces, only ledgers. I am not
afraid. Ash on my sleeve is only ash. The work continues where the bells do not scold.
Lexicus’s margin, scorched: A book left unburned may burn the hand if kept open too long.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
In the bright stalls I opened yesterday’s notebook to the page where I had copied “ford held.” The
pencil’s faint groove remained, yet the words themselves were gone—as if the paper had remembered
being blank. Under a slant of light the graphite dust shows, but no phrase returns to be swept back
into being.
I rubbed the margin; my thumb came away gritty. Salt, or ash. I will copy the words again in a
heavier hand and see if they keep.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
The door was open.
I needed no key. The corridor that always looks tired looked merely itself; the oak looked newly
rubbed, as before. Aqyl, son of Aqyl stood within, beside a table where a Canré board was already
set. The room was clean—no dust bloom, no cobweb banners—only the faint crust of pale grit
brushed to the skirting, and the scent of candles put out with care warmed into the wood.
He said my name in the ordinary way, and then: “Come in.”
19
Later (same day), copied with a cool hand.
Eight candles were lit; a ninth vessel stood unlit—a small cup of oil with a clean wick asleep in it.
No flourish. On the floor, only the rumor of a ring, as if a damp cord had once been set down and
lifted again before it could confess. A shallow bowl of water stood at the table’s end. He did not
explain it.
We sat. He placed my hand upon the board as if teaching a child to write. “Count,” he said, very
quietly. “Not the numbers you know. The ones the room knows.” He hummed two notes under his
breath; my own hum—uninvited—found a third that did not wish to arrive. We began.
The pieces—let me call them that—moved as furniture moves in a house long lived in: without
thinking, habit to habit. The middle learned to be a shallow river; the edges remembered weight.
Each time I paused, the air along my neck lifted with the suggestion of feathers, and the eight
flames leaned as if a draft went past them on purpose. When I strayed toward the easy line, Aqyl’s
thumb tapped the table—eight light touches and then a pause that refused to become the ninth.
He did not look at me when he did it. He looked at the unlit cup.
“Name nothing yet,” he said once, with the same voice he uses to correct a sum. “When it is time,
you will not have to reach for the word; it will arrive already shaped to your mouth.”
I do not think we played long, and yet I came away with the sense of a road walked and priced:
crossings taught, not taken; chairs left waiting; cups poured and refused. Once—only once—the
rules I had brought into the room moved aside as a porter lifts a rope. I set a piece where I knew
I should not, and the air accepted it without rebuke, like water learning a new edge for a breath.
Then the moment closed as a pupil closes upon light, and the ordinary measure resumed.
When we rose, the eight wicks sat smaller, blue at their bases, and the oil in the ninth cup held a
patient chill—like a word that will not yet consent to be spoken. Aqyl pinched each flame out with
steadiness and did not look at me until the last thin smoke climbed and made its small rope toward
the rafters.
“Eat something warm,” he said, as always, and—lightly—“Read where the bells can scold you.”
Then, softer, not quite a question: “You will come back.”
I am in the bright stalls now. The bells are loud. The page holds still. My hand is steady. I have
copied what I saw and will stop there, for now.
If there is more to tell, it will knock. If it does not knock, I will hum on the way home and let the
lamps do their work. The tune sits easily in the mouth. After all, it is a pretty ballad.
2.16 Fragment L–16 (876 AR) — Lerris Enrolls; A Quiet Vow
Provenance: a present–day note by M. Fenwood; paper new, hand steady. A sliver of dark metal
(the not–key) is pasted to the margin with sealing–wax residue; beneath it, a Wardens’ receipt is
pinned through.
Present hand (876 AR), M. Fenwood
My brother Lerris arrived with a trunk and a grin and an enrollment chit that still smelled of warm
wax. We walked the outer courts as we used to walk the lanes at home, naming buildings, counting
bells. He is taller than I remember and kinder than I deserve. He asked where to begin.
20
I said: the bright stalls, the public rooms, the catalog, the ordinary work. We found him a bed in
the north dormitory, ate something warm (stew, brown bread), and watched the porter lock the
gate. The lamps minded their order. The hour struck and minded its business. We counted to eight
and held.
I thought of the little study, and the cool of the oak, and the way some pages answer if you are
patient. I thought of the door.
Mark what it took to answer. Warm food. Bells within hearing. A second set of footsteps beside
mine—kept for the count. A page to write on.
I have wrapped the sliver–that–is–not–a–key in plain paper and sealed it. At first bell I went to
the Wardens’ desk and handed it across. The clerk weighed the metal like bread, wrote a number,
circled it once and then again, and kept the piece. He sealed the wrapper to a narrow finding card
“for the file,” stamped the same number, and returned it with a stub. I have pasted the stub here
so the act does not depend upon my memory.
I will write Alayse tonight—first line empty, sealed with salt as is proper—and tell her the day’s true
sum. I will read in the bright rooms, under lamps that scold, and I will not enter the condemned
door: not alone, not without a porter’s book signed, not without naming what it takes to answer.
If the room wants more, it can knock where a porter listens and say its price in daylight. Until
then, we will copy what we can prove and leave the first line empty.
Small hand at the foot of the page, in a finer ink: The Ninth demands it...
Coda — Letter from Lerris to Conlin (876 AR)
From: Lerris Fenwood, North Dormitory, Thepyrgos
To: Conlin Fenwood, House Fenwood
Seal: common wax; first line left empty
Brother,
I am arrived. The porter took your signed chit and found it in order. Markus met me in the outer
court. He is thinner than I remember and very steady. We walked the squares as at home, naming
buildings, keeping the bells. When they came to eight he let the hush run and then we went on.
He showed me the bright stalls and the public rooms, set me in the north dormitory, and saw me fed
(stew, brown bread). In the catalog hall a thin gentleman in a linen coat greeted us—Aqyl, he wrote,
and then, after a breath, s. Aqyl. He asked after the Valvano legacy and said our house had kept
good ledgers. He trimmed a finding card for me and said, mild as weather, that a clean first line
keeps the lamps honest. He was warm and in a hurry and was gone before I could thank him twice.
The bright rooms are easy to work in. If I step wrong-footed, one of the lamps gives a small scold
and then settles. There is a drum somewhere that keeps even time with the bells when you stand
by the catalog table. It makes the counting easy.
This evening, when I shook out my coat before folding it, a narrow card in a paper sleeve slid from
the inside pocket. It is bone-colored, sealed along one edge, and carries a long number in a precise
hand. I thought perhaps the catalog man tucked it there with the card. As I turned it, there was a
21
brief whisper at my shoulder—one soft syllable, maybe only the porter on the stair—and I shook it
off.
I am resolved to return it to the desk at first bell. I must confess I was curious about its contents,
and to my shame I opened it; there is within a thin, bright sliver, colder than paper, that—
Forgive me. I must conclude this letter and keep the hours.
Your brother,
Lerris

3 Rites & Scenarios
“Call a rule a law for the hand; call a rite a lens for the eye. Turn the lens and the same moves
speak differently. Remove it, and nothing is broken.”
— Lexicus of Thepyrgos, margin note
What follows. This part presents seven self-contained overlays (Rites) you may toggle ON or OFF
per session. Each one adjusts what you notice—pace, pressure, information—without changing the
tournament core. Leave any Rite OFF and play proceeds exactly as you already know it.
Anatomy of a scenario. Every scenario includes:
• Hook — the in-world cue that frames the table mood.
• Switch & Scope — explicit ON/OFF; never touches core rules.
• Setup & Components — simple markers (ribbon, beads, chits) you can substitute from
household items.
• Rite (exact) — concise, rules-precise text.
• Clarifications — edge cases, if any.
• Clue beat — an optional thread in the dossier’s larger puzzle.
• Why it’s safe — a brief reassurance of rules integrity.
• If OFF — a reminder that play is unchanged.
Reading the cues. When a scenario mentions documents or fragments, they enrich the scene
but never confer hidden advantages. The choice to use a Rite is aesthetic and procedural, not
compulsory.
Suggested table aids. A slim ribbon (for the perimeter), five beads or coins (for public counts),
and a few copper-colored tokens (for optional actions). Printable templates appear in the appendices.
Begin with §3.1 — a simple perimeter ward that makes the edge feel like a threshold without moving
a single rule.
3.1 Scenario 1 — Salt Stitch
Hook. Markus notes the caravan custom of dusting thresholds with salt; the board’s rim echoes
the ward.
Switch. ON / OFF (default OFF) Scope. Scenario-scoped; never alters tournament core.
Components. A thin ribbon, string, or corner markers sufficient to indicate the board’s outermost
ring (salt-band).
Setup. Before normal setup, lay a visible salt-band tracing the perimeter ring.
23
Rite (exact). While this Rite is ON, Green pieces may not enter, cross, or end on any perimeter
square. All other pieces ignore the band. No other rules change.
Clarifications.
• If any effect would place a Green onto a perimeter square (including specials or setup variants),
that placement is illegal; choose another legal option.
• Adjacency across the band is allowed; only occupancy/crossing of perimeter squares by Greens
is prohibited.
• Captures by or against Greens proceed normally, provided the Green’s path does not require
stepping onto a perimeter square.
Example (two turns). A Green approaches the rim to cut a lane; the opponent pressures along
the edge. The Green must weave one file inward (may not step onto, or hop through, the perimeter),
delaying the escape by a tempo without changing any costs or capture rules.
Clue beat. A city map leaf shows pinholes; rotate 17◦and sanctums align with gatehouses.
Why it’s safe. Only restricts where Greens may legally occupy or traverse; does not alter move
generation, costs, rooting, specials, or scoring.
If OFF: Play is unchanged.
Diagram cue (optional). Perimeter traced; corner exemplars marked with ×to illustrate barred end
squares for Greens (caption: all perimeter squares are barred to Greens).
3.2 Scenario 2 — Witness at the Ford
Hook. “Stay more than thrice at the ford and the Witness takes you.” The center is a crossing, not
a seat.
Switch. ON / OFF (default OFF) Scope. Scenario-scoped; never alters tournament core.
Components. None beyond the standard set (optional: a small die or bead per Blue to track
counts).
Setup. None.
Rite (exact). While this Rite is ON, each Blue tracks how many of its controller’s consecutive
turns it has ended on any square of the Central Four (the 2×2 center). If a Blue would end a 4th
consecutive turn in the Central Four, that Blue is forfeit (captured) immediately at end of turn.
Leaving the Central Four at any point resets that Blue’s count to 0.
Clarifications.
• “Consecutive turns” means turns of that Blue’s controller. If a Blue remains in the Central
Four across an opponent’s turn, the count is unaffected until its controller’s next turn ends.
• A Blue that is Rooted within the Central Four still accumulates counts (it is “staying”).
24
• If a Blue leaves the Central Four (by moving, being displaced, or captured) its count resets to
0. If it later re-enters, start again from 1 the next time it ends its controller’s turn there.
• Track each Blue separately. If a Blue is captured before reaching four, remove its counter (if
any).
• If a pass or skip occurs and the Blue remains in the Central Four, that still counts as having
“ended the turn” there.
Example (tempo at the ford). On Turn A1, Blueα ends in the Central Four (count 1). On B1
nothing changes for Blueα. On A2 it still ends there (count 2); on A3 (count 3). If on A4 it would
again end in the Central Four, it is forfeited at end of A4. If instead it steps out on A3 and returns
on A4, the count resets—A4 becomes count 1.
Clue beat. A toll ledger shows three sequential stamps; the fourth is crossed in ash, matching the
“three then price” cadence seen in Candle Count.
Why it’s safe. Adds a local stay-timer only for Blues in the Central Four; no movement rules,
costs, specials, or captures elsewhere are changed.
If OFF: Play is unchanged.
Diagram cue (optional). Shade the 2×2 center; place a small numeral bead beside any Blue that
ends there to show its current count (1–3).
3.3 Scenario 3 — Veil of Names
Hook. The cult forbids doctrine-naming: “Names bind exits.” Play as if identity were a mask you
choose not to lift.
Switch. ON / OFF (default OFF) Scope. Scenario-scoped; never alters tournament core.
Components. Optional: two blank cards or slips for private notes (face-down school cards).
Setup. If desired, each player writes a single word or icon on a slip (their “school” or guiding
maxim) and places it face-down near their board edge. Do not reveal it during play.
Rite (exact). While this Rite is ON, players do not declare schools or doctrines publicly.
Any thematic school choice is kept private and has no mechanical effect. All rules, moves, costs,
specials, scoring, and timers proceed exactly as normal.
Clarifications.
• This Rite introduces secrecy of theme only. It does not grant, suppress, or modify any ability.
• If a format or local variant requires a public pre-declaration, ignore this Rite for that session.
• Table talk and reads are allowed as normal; players may infer style but must not demand
disclosure.
25
• At the end of the game, players may reveal their face-down slips for color; revealing is optional
and confers nothing.
Example (table texture). Two players sit without naming doctrine. One leans into cautious
exits; the other pressures lanes early. Each is reading the other’s play, not their banner—tension
without rule-changes.
Clue beat. Two training slates in the dossier mark evaluations that match no known doc-
trine—scholars nickname it the Gray Ledger, which “prices exits rather than blocking them.”
Why it’s safe. Pure information fog: no move generation, costs, captures, rooting, specials, or
scoring are changed.
If OFF: Play is unchanged.
Diagram cue (optional). Small icon of a face-down card with a crossed speech bubble; caption:
“Theme kept private; rules unchanged.”
3.4 Scenario 4 — Candle Count
Hook. A chant sheet with five circles; bead marks that read like a ledger. Make tempo visible
without changing a single rule.
Switch. ON / OFF (default OFF) Scope. Scenario-scoped; never alters tournament core.
Components. A five-step track and 5 beads (coins, pebbles, or counters). Optional: a divider to
separate unlit and lit sides.
Setup. Place the five beads on the unlit side of the track within view of both players.
Rite (exact). While this Rite is ON, slide one bead from unlit to lit each time any of the
following occurs:
1. A piece ends its turn in the Cross.
2. A Blue becomes Rooted.
3. Any special is used.
When all five beads are lit, announce “chant complete,” then reset all five beads to the unlit side.
No other rules change.
Clarifications.
• If multiple triggers occur during a single turn (e.g., a special is used and a piece ends in the
Cross), slide one bead per trigger, up to the remaining unlit beads.
• If the fifth bead lights mid-turn, announce completion immediately, reset the track, and
continue play; additional triggers that same turn begin filling the new cycle.
• The track is public information; either player may slide beads when a trigger occurs (good
manners: announce aloud).
26
• This Rite does not add time, costs, or constraints; it only records notable moments.
Example (one cycle). Turn A: a special is used (+1). Turn B: no triggers. Turn A: a Blue is
Rooted (+1). Turn B: a piece ends in the Cross (+1). Turn A: special (+1). Turn B: Cross end
again (+1) ⇒fifth bead lights, chant complete; reset. Play continues unchanged.
Clue beat. Each chant complete marks a base-5 digit on the dossier’s brass strip; across scenarios,
digits map to letters that assemble the final Wound Name (see Part III).
Why it’s safe. Pure information surfacing: no movement, capture, rooting, specials, scoring, or
timers are altered.
If OFF: Play is unchanged.
Diagram cue (optional). A five-circle track with three lit markers (•••◦◦) and icons beside the
triggers: [ Cross], [ ⊥ Rooted], [S Special].
3.5 Scenario 5 — Copper & Salt
Hook. House of Wells ledgers mirror temple tithes; little chits move where coins should be.
Switch. ON / OFF (default OFF) Scope. Scenario-scoped; never alters tournament core.
Components. 3 Copper tokens per player; Patrol marker (a single coin or chit); optional Cleared
marker (for Salt-band gaps).
Setup. Give each player a personal bank with a capacity of 3 Copper. Each player starts with
0 Copper (unless another Rite says otherwise; e.g., §3.6 Oath of Copper starts with +2). Place the
Patrol and Cleared markers within reach.
Rite (exact). While this Rite is ON:
1. Gain Copper. When you Seed or establish a legal banner lane, gain +1 Copper (to a
maximum of 3). Excess is lost.
2. Spend Copper (once, before your turn begins). You may spend 1 Copper to do one of
the following:
(a) Purify (Salt). If Salt Stitch (§3.1) is ON, choose any perimeter square and mark it
Cleared. For the remainder of the game, Greens treat that square as normal (they may
enter/cross/end there despite the salt-band).
(b) Peek (Leaf). Draw/peek the next leaf or clue packet for this scenario’s dossier thread
(if in use), then return/resolve as instructed. (If no clue packet is being used, ignore this
option.)
(c) Patrol (Perimeter). Place a Patrol marker on a perimeter square. Until the start of
your next turn, your opponent may not end a move on that marked square. (Moving
through is allowed.) Remove the marker at the start of your next turn.
Clarifications.
27
• Copper tokens have no value toward victory; they are a light economy used only for the three
options above.
• You may gain at most +2 Copper on a single turn if you both Seed and complete a banner
lane, respecting the cap of 3.
• Purify is unavailable if Salt Stitch is OFF. Each Cleared square is permanent for the rest of
the game.
• Patrol denies only ending a move on that square and only to your opponent; it expires at the
start of your next turn.
• Spending occurs before your turn begins; you may not chain multiple spends in the same turn
(choose one option per turn at most).
Example (one cycle). You Seed this turn (+1 Copper; total now 1). Before your next turn, you
spend that 1 Copper on Purify, marking a rim square Cleared. On the following turn you establish
a banner lane (+1; total 1) and spend it before your next turn on Patrol, denying an enemy end on
a critical corner until your turn returns.
Clue beat. A tithe ledger phrases the Reforge Compact like a hostage-exchange clause; the Peek
option reveals a marginal annotation pointing toward the finale.
Why it’s safe. Off-board tokens and markers affect only information and tempo nudges; no
movement, capture, costs, rooting, specials, scoring, or timers are altered.
If OFF: Play is unchanged.
Diagram cue (optional). Three coin icons near each player; a Cleared dot on one rim square; a small
shield icon () on a patrolled rim square (captioned “opponent may not end here until your next
turn”).
3.6 Scenario 6 — Ash–Fenn Rite
Hook. The vault burned; players bind themselves to an opening penance—trading early ease for
later relief.
Switch. ON / OFF (default OFF) Scope. Scenario-scoped; never alters tournament core.
Components. Optional: three Oath cards per player (Water, Salt, Copper); one small marker
labeled Bound.
Setup. Each player chooses exactly one Oath secretly, then reveals simultaneously. Both players
may choose the same Oath.
Rite (exact). While this Rite is ON, each player gains the text of their chosen Oath:
Oath of Water. The first time this game you would move a Blue, you instead forgo that
move (treat it as a voluntary pass for that Blue only; no other effects). Once per game, you
may have one of your Blues step from a sanctum into the Cross even if it is Rooted.
This step must otherwise be legal (ignores only the Rooted restriction).
28
Oath of Salt. If Salt Stitch (§3.1) is ON, you begin under the salt band as normal, but once per
game youmayignorethesalt-bandforasingleBluemove(thatBluemayenter/cross/end
on perimeter squares for that move only). If Salt Stitch is OFF, this Oath has no effect
(choose another Oath during setup if desired).
Oath of Copper. Start the game with +2 Copper (see §3.5; your bank cap of 3 still applies).
The first time you Seed this game, place a Bound marker on that Seed’s target and delay
all effects of that Seed (including any rooting or derived effects) until the end of your
next turn. Remove the Bound marker when it resolves. If the target becomes illegal before
resolution, the Seed fizzles (remove it with no effect).
Clarifications.
• Oath of Water: “first time you would move a Blue” refers to the first Blue move you attempt
in the game, regardless of turn number; you cannot “skip” triggering by selecting a different
piece—trigger occurs at the first legal Blue move you choose.
• Oath of Salt: the one-move waiver applies to a single Blue move only and does not persist;
other Blues and later moves remain bound by the salt-band.
• Oath of Copper: you cannot exceed a personal Copper capacity of 3; gaining beyond the cap
is lost. The delayed Seed has no interim effects until it resolves.
• You may never benefit from more than one Oath; the unchosen Oaths confer nothing.
Example (opening stitches). Player A takes Water: on their first attempted Blue move they
forgo it, later using the once-per-game sanctum→Cross step to break a midgame bind. Player B
takes Copper: starts at 2 Copper (→cap 3 on early gains) and declares a Seed; it sits Bound until
the end of their next turn, then roots normally—buying tempo now, paying certainty later.
Clue beat. A scraped page from the Concordance—the redacted Twin–Oases—links penance to
crossing; a marginal hand hints at a final word reserved for the closing scenario.
Why it’s safe. One-time commitments and permissions that gate timing only; core movement,
captures, costs, specials, scoring, and timers remain pristine.
If OFF: Play is unchanged.
Diagram cue (optional). Three small oath icons at player edge (♢ Water, △Salt, ◦Copper); a
Bound marker on a pending Seed; a single arrow from sanctum to Cross labeled “once”.
3.7 Scenario 7 — The Ninth
Hook. “Count eight before breath; the ninth is a wound.” The dossier insists there is a word you
do not say until the crossing is priced.
Switch. ON / OFF (default OFF) Scope. Scenario-scoped; never alters tournament core.
Components. Wound Name card (assembled from prior letters) or a sealed Name from the
appendix; optional Crack marker for one perimeter arc.
29
Setup.
1. Campaign mode. Using letters decoded across earlier scenarios (e.g., §3.4), assemble the
Wound Name. Write it on a slip and place it face-down near the board.
2. One–shot mode. Draw a sealed Wound Name from the appendix and place it face-down.
3. Optional bite. Mark a single perimeter arc as cracked. Pieces may pass through that arc as
normal but may not end on its two corner squares until the Wound is named.
Rite (exact). While this Rite is ON:
1. On your turn, after completing a legal move, you may speak a single candidate Wound Name
aloud (at most once per turn).
2. If the spoken Name matches the face-down Wound Name, immediately gain a one–turn
Rite–Break: choose any one active Rite and suspend its rules for you only for the
remainder of your current turn. Then reveal the face-down Name and read the final leaf.
3. If the spoken Name does not match, nothing happens; you may try again on a later turn.
Clarifications.
• Rite–Break affects only Rites that are currently ON (e.g., ignore the salt-band once from §3.1;
nullify the center stay-timer from §3.2; take an immediate Peek from §3.5 without spending
Copper). It never alters core movement, capture, costs, or timers.
• If no other Rite is ON, naming the Wound has no mechanical effect; reveal the Name and
proceed (narrative only).
• Optional bite (cracked arc) is a cosmetic constraint you may omit for a purer board. If used,
the restriction on ending on the two corner squares is lifted as soon as the Wound is named.
• Verification: if dispute arises, consult the sealed appendix solution for the Name chosen at
setup.
Example (resolution). Midgame with Salt Stitch and Witness at the Ford both ON, a player
completes a legal move, speaks the correct Name, then chooses to suspend Witness at the Ford for
this turn only—allowing a fourth consecutive end in the center to set up a capture. The Name is
revealed; play continues under normal Rite effects from the next turn onward.
Clue beat. The final letters from §3.4 completions plus two marginal initials hidden in the dossier
produce the Name; the face-down slip confirms it.
Why it’s safe. The transient power touches Rites only; core legality, win conditions, and scoring
remain pristine. The cracked arc is optional and easily omitted.
If OFF: Play is unchanged.
Diagram cue (optional). A small face-down card icon labeled “Wound Name”; a dashed highlight
over one perimeter arc (cracked) and a tiny toggle symbol to illustrate a one–turn suspension of a
Rite.

4 Puzzles & Scholar’s Path
“Do not be clever first. Be clear first. Then, if the page still asks, be patient.”
— Aqyl, to a junior reader
What this part is. A set of diegetic puzzles woven from the dossier’s artifacts—maps, stamps,
bead-tracks, marginalia. Each puzzle is self-contained and optional. Solving changes what you
notice, not what you are allowed to do.
What it is not. There are no secret rules hidden here. Tournament play remains untouched
whether you solve everything or nothing.
Fairness & construction.
• In-book solvable. Every puzzle can be solved using materials in this volume (no outside lore
required).
• Cross-checkable. Each has an unambiguous solution in the sealed appendix.
• Diegetic cues. All transformations (rotations, counts, overlays) are motivated by in-world
practices—toll stamps, chant cadence, survey drift, etc.
• Accessibility. No puzzle relies solely on color; shapes, symbols, or counts provide redundant
signals.
How to use hints. A four-rung ladder accompanies each puzzle:
1. Nudge 1 — a gentle reframing (no new facts).
2. Nudge 2 — points at the relevant artifact features.
3. Nudge 3 — states the key operation (e.g., “rotate 17°”).
4. Reveal — the full solution (in the sealed appendix).
Hint codes appear as [H1] [H2] [H3] [R] with page references.
Scholar’s Path. A suggested route threads the puzzles in a rising curve of difficulty, pairing each
with a scenario where its discovery feels best at the table. You can follow the path front-to-back,
pick selectively, or read everything as lore.
Encodings you will meet.
• Thepyrgosi Cadence — public events (Cross ends, Rooted Blues, specials) produce a
five-bead rhythm; cycles map to base–5 digits (§3.4). The digit→letter table lives in the
appendix.
• Map Overlays — city grids pin-holed to rotate to 17◦ (sanctumsgates) and occasionally
reflected against toll-river axes.
• Ledger Substitutions — tally marks, seal rosettes, and triangle stamps encode positions
via simple substitution; every symbol is introduced before it’s required.
31
• Veils & Blanks — deliberate omissions (first-line left empty, unnamed doctrines) are part of
the signal; treat silence as a count.
Solo & group use.
• Solo dossier. Work puzzles between scenarios; check [H1] only after a timed attempt (10–15
minutes), then proceed rung by rung as needed.
• Table assist. Useonlythetable-facing rules line foreachRite(boldheader+one-linemechanic);
ignore the dossier prose while clocks run. Announce toggles pre-game and use minimal aids
(beads/ward markers).
4.1 Puzzle 1 — The Candle Ledger (Primer in Quinary)
What you need. The five–bead track from §3.4 and this page.
Premise. In Candle Count, each chant complete consists of five triggers. For this primer, encode
each trigger as a single base–5 digit using the etched weights on the brass strip:
[ Cross end] →digit 2
[ ⊥ Blue becomes Rooted] →digit 1
[S Special used] →digit 3
Write the five digits in order as the events occur during a chant. That 5-digit base–5 “chant
code” later maps to a letter via the table in the Sealed Appendix.
Goal. Convert the three logged chants below into their 5-digit base–5 codes. Leave the letter
blanks empty for now; you will translate them when you reach the appendix.
Logged chants (from a clerk’s slate).
1. [] [ ⊥] [S] [] [] code: _ _ _ _ _ letter: _
2. [S] [] [ ⊥] [S] [⊥] code: _ _ _ _ _ letter: _
3. [] [] [S] [ ⊥] [S] code: _ _ _ _ _ letter: _
Worked micro–example (not part of the three). Sequence: [] [S] [ ⊥] [] [S] Digits: 2 3 1 2 3

Fairness. Every symbol used above appears earlier in Part II. No external knowledge is required.
The digit→letter mapping is published in the Sealed Appendix to preserve discovery order.
Hint ladder. (Reveal codes only as needed.)
32
• [H1] Count in order. Each chant is exactly five events; write five digits left-to-right as they
occur.
• [H2] Use the brass–strip weights: Cross = 2, Rooted = 1, Special = 3. No other values appear
in this primer.
• [H3] Keep the base: treat the five digits as a base–5 code, not five separate numbers in
base–10. The translation to letters lives in Appendix A.
• [R] Compare your three codes to the chant→letter table in the Sealed Appendix. The three
letters form a word you would expect to meet near water.
4.2 Puzzle 2 — The Map at Seventeen (Gate Overlay)
What you need. The city map leaf with pinholes, a board/grid, and this page.
Premise. The dossier claims the city plan overlays the board when rotated 17◦(sanctums align
with gatehouses). Five small seal marks on the map’s rim are intended to land on five specific
perimeter squares after the rotation. Each seal mark encodes a digit (base–5); read the five digits in
order (clockwise) to recover a single letter.
Legend (ledger substitutions for this page).
Seal symbol Digit (base–5)
△(triangle stamp) 0
∗(rosette seal)† 1
∥(double–bar tally) 2
•(ink dot) 3
□ (blank/box placeholder) 4
†Any small flowered stamp counts as “rosette.”
Goal. Produce a 5–digit base–5 code by locating the five seals in clockwise order (starting from
the northernmost), then convert that 5–digit code to a single letter using the table in the Sealed
Appendix.
Procedure.
1. Place the map leaf over the board and rotate it 17◦clockwise. Pinholes should align so that
four gatehouses sit on sanctums.
2. Find the five tiny seal marks printed near the map rim (they’ll now sit over five perimeter
squares).
3. Starting from the northernmost of the five, read them in clockwise order, converting each
to a digit using the Legend.
4. Write the resulting 5–digit base–5 code. Translate to a letter via the appendix’s quinary
chant/code →letter table.
33
Worked micro–example (illustrative only). Suppose your five seals (clockwise from north)
are: △, •, ∥, ∗, □ Digits: 0 3 2 1 4 ⇒code 03214(5) ⇒look up 03214 in the appendix to obtain a
letter.
Logging box.
Order (N→CW) 5–digit code (base–5) Letter (appendix)
#1 #2 #3 #4 #5
Fairness. All five symbols appear elsewhere in the dossier; the 17◦rotation is explicitly clued in
Part II; no outside maps or lore needed.
Hint ladder.
• [H1] Align sanctums to gatehouses by rotating the map 17◦ clockwise; don’t worry about
exact millimeters—line up the idea.
• [H2] Start at the northernmost seal and go clockwise; if two are tied for “north,” choose the
one slightly east.
• [H3] Use the Legend on this page; do not invent extra symbols. Treat the result as a single
5–digit base–5 number.
• [R] The code resolves to a letter commonly associated with thresholds in this volume.
4.3 Puzzle 3 — The House of Wells Gutter (Triangle Ledger)
What you need. The toll ledger leaf with the stamped left gutter (triangles, rosettes, bars, dots,
and blanks) and this page.
Premise. House of Wells clerks mark a five-slot stamp rail in the left gutter of certain pages—one
tiny seal per slot. The sequence is a substitution in base–5. Read the five stamps top-to-bottom to
form a 5-digit code, then map that code to a letter (see Sealed Appendix).
Legend (reuse from §4.2).
Seal symbol Digit (base–5)
△(triangle stamp) 0
∗(rosette seal) 1
∥(double–bar tally) 2
•(ink dot) 3
□ (blank/box placeholder) 4
Goal. Extract three letters hidden in the ledger by decoding three five-stamp columns in the left
gutter (labeled A, B, C):
1. For each column A/B/C, read the five tiny seals top-to-bottom.
2. Convert each seal to its digit using the Legend to get a 5-digit base–5 code.
3. Translate each 5-digit code to a letter via the table in the Sealed Appendix.
34
Procedure (what to ignore). Ignore all amounts, dates, and handwritten totals. Only the
narrow stamp rail at the very left matters. If a slot shows an abraded mark, treat it as the symbol
it most closely resembles (the appendix art provides a comparison row).
Worked micro–example (illustrative). Suppose gutter A shows (top→bottom): △, ∥, •, ∗, □.
Digits: 0 2 3 1 4 ⇒code 02314(5) ⇒look up in the appendix to get a letter.

Fairness. The five symbols were introduced earlier. No arithmetic beyond substitution is required.
Smudged stamps are printed with enough detail to distinguish dot vs. rosette vs. blank.
Hint ladder.
• [H1] Ignore the money. Read only the skinny column of stamps at the far left.
• [H2] Each gutter is five slots tall; top-to-bottom equals left-to-right in the code you’ll write.
• [H3] Use the same symbol→digit mapping as the Seventeen Map (§4.2); treat the result as a
single base–5 number.
• [R] The three letters, in order, spell something that lives along the edge of things.
4.4 Puzzle 4 — Twin–Oases Mirror (River Fold)
What you need. The scraped Concordance leaf titled “Twin–Oases” (the one with two well marks
at opposite edges and a faint river line) and this page.
Premise. The erased “opening” is really an overlay: the leaf’s river axis is a fold line. When you
mirror the east half to the west (no actual folding required), five small spill-marks along the rim
land over specific perimeter squares. Each spill-mark contains 0–4 hatch strokes; the count is a
digit in base–5.
Goal. Read the five mirrored spill-marks in clockwise order beginning at the northernmost,
counting the hatch strokes in each (0–4) to form a 5-digit base–5 code. Convert that code to a
single letter via the table in the Sealed Appendix.
Procedure.
1. Identify the faint river axis printed across the Twin–Oases leaf (a ruled line with tiny ford
dots). Treat it as a mirror line.
2. Mentally reflect the east half of the leaf onto the west (or lightly trace the reflection). After
reflection, locate the five small spill-marks that now sit over perimeter squares.
35

same digit in base–5.

Fairness. The river axis is visibly printed on the Twin–Oases leaf; the five spill-marks are distinct
droplets with short internal hatches. No color is required; counts are by shape alone.
Hint ladder.
• [H1] The river axis is your mirror line; reflect east onto west (not a rotation).
• [H2] Start at the northernmost spill-mark after reflection; proceed clockwise.
• [H3] Count the tiny short strokes inside each droplet: 0–4; treat the result as a single base–5
number.
• [R] Your letter is one repeatedly associated with water and thresholds in this volume.
4.5 Puzzle 5 — The Veil Page (Redactions Count)
What you need. The deposition leaf labeled “Veil of Names” (the one with black redaction bars
in the text) and this page.
Premise. In sworn statements where names are “veiled,” scribes leave the first rubric line empty
and then redact 0–4 names per line in the next five lines. The count of bars on each of those
five lines (top to bottom) forms a 5–digit base–5 code. That code maps to a single letter in the
Sealed Appendix.
Goal. For each stanza on the leaf (A and B), ignore the deliberately blank opening line, then read
the next five lines top–to–bottom, counting black bars on each line (0–4). Write the resulting
5–digit base–5 code and convert it to a letter via the appendix table.
36
Procedure.
1. Locate stanza A. It begins with a visibly blank first line (Veil rule: “leave the first line
empty”). Do not count that line.
2. For the next five lines, count the number of black redaction bars on each line (each continuous
bar counts as 1, even if long).
3. Record those five counts as digits 0–4 to form your 5–digit base–5 code.
4. Repeat for stanza B.
5. Translate each code to a letter using the table in the Sealed Appendix.
Clarifications.
• Treat a broken bar that is clearly a scribal crack as one bar.
• Ignore punctuation, marginal notes, or small “x” placeholders; only solid black bars count.
• Each counted line is guaranteed to have between 0 and 4 bars by design—never more.
Worked micro–example (illustrative). Suppose stanza A shows (after the blank line): Line 1:
■ Line 2: ■ ■ Line 3: (no bars) Line 4: ■ ■ ■ Line 5: ■ Counts = 1,2,0,3,1 ⇒code
12031(5) ⇒look up in the appendix to obtain a letter.
Logging grid.
Stanza 5–digit code (base–5) Letter (appendix)

Fairness. The “first line empty” cue is explicit on the leaf; bars are high-contrast and countable;
no color needed.
Hint ladder.
• [H1] The blank opening line is part of the signal—skip it, then count the next five.
• [H2] Each continuous black rectangle counts as one, regardless of length.
• [H3] Your result is a single 5–digit base–5 number per stanza; do not add or average.
• [R] The two letters together form a word often left unsaid in the dossier.

5 The Sacred Geometry
“Keep the sums straight even when the breath runs. What you cannot prove, bracket; what you
can, make plain.”
— Aqyl, notation lecture (excerpt)
What this part is. Short, non-binding essays on measurements, maps, and counting conventions
that appear in the dossier. These sidebars are interpretive lenses, not rules. Use them to make
sense of artifacts or to add table texture; ignore them and tournament play remains pristine.
How to read these.
• Plain claims first. Each sidebar begins with a one-sentence claim you can test.
• Sources. Citations point to fragments by page/folio; disputed points are labeled contested.
• Use at the table. A small box suggests a harmless way to notice the idea during casual play
(never a rule change).

Editorial note. These pages are written conservatively. Where a claim touches doctrine, we present
multiple readings and let the artifacts speak. Nothing in Part IV alters movement, costs, capture,
rooting, specials, scoring, or timers.
5.1 The Sacred Geometry I — Irregular First–Era Rings
Plain claim. Early field copies show measurable “wobble” in the perimeter ring; this drift is
copy–artifact, not doctrine.
38
Notes. Hand–ruled boards and roadside tracings (cf. §2.2, §3.1) produce slight arc eccentrici-
ties—typically 1−3% of square width. These irregularities correlate with travel wear (salt, damp)
rather than with any stated Rite. Lexicus’s “salt–pressed” leaves (§2.2) exaggerate the effect where
the rim held moisture.
Use at the table (optional). If you’ve printed the perimeter ribbon for §3.1, allow a gentle,
cosmetic misalignment rather than forcing a perfect circle. No rules change.
Sources. L–series fragments §2.2, §2.12; map overlay §4.2. Status: uncontroversial.
5.2 The Sacred Geometry II — Survey Drift & Gate Alignment
Plain claim. Rotating the Thepyrgos plan by ≈17◦aligns four historical gatehouses with board
sancta; treat the angle as accumulated survey drift, not intent.
Notes. The pin–holed city leaf (§4.2) yields a best–fit rotation of 16.8◦ within a ±2◦ tolerance.
The “17◦” cue recurs as marginal instruction (§3.1, Clue beat). The alignment disappears under
modern map–north assumptions and reappears if one adopts older river–north conventions. No
metaphysical claim is required; this is a cartographic convenience that happens to surface pleasing
correspondences.
Use at the table (optional). When staging props, allow any rotation in [15◦
,19◦] to “read”
visually. Do not rotate the actual board or alter legal geometry. No rules change.
Sources. Map leaf §4.2; Salt Stitch §3.1. Status: supported.
5.3 The Sacred Geometry III — Breath →Quinary
Plain claim. Public events can be logged as a five–bead cadence that reads as base–5 digits.
Minimal mapping (as used in §3.4).
Cross end →2
Blue becomes Rooted →1
Special used →3
Write the five digits of a chant in order to form a quinary code; translate via the sealed table (see
§4.1). Other tables exist historically, but this volume fixes the above for consistency.
Use at the table (optional). Announce triggers aloud (“Cross,” “Rooted,” “Special”) while
sliding beads. No rules change.
Sources. Candle Count §3.4; Puzzle 1 §4.1. Status: canonical within this volume.
5.4 The Sacred Geometry IV — Fords & Sancta: A Taxonomy
Plain claim. A ford is a place priced for crossing; a sanctum is a place priced for not crossing.
Notes. The dossier uses “ford” for central, transitory pressure (§2.5, §3.2) and “sanctum” for the
fixed, often gate–aligned corners (§4.2). Heuristic: if a location’s value increases the longer one
stays, it behaves sanctum–like; if cost escalates when one lingers (e.g., Witness timer), it is ford–like.
39
Use at the table (optional). Describe your threats using “cross” vs. “keep” language to signal
mood. No rules change.
Sources. L–series §2.4, §2.5; Scenario 2 §3.2. Status: interpretive.
5.5 The Sacred Geometry V — The Gray Ledger (Unpublished)
Plain claim. A reconstructed doctrine that “prices exits” appears in training slates but nowhere
formal; provenance is contested.
Notes. Two slates (§3.3 Clue beat) score lines by deferred exit rather than denial—a style gloss, not
a rule. The name “Gray Ledger” is a modern label for these margins. No mechanical text survives
beyond suggestive evaluation marks.
Use at the table (optional). In casual play, try phrasing threats as costs (“you can exit, but it
prices your next”) to shift tempo reading. No rules change.
Sources. Veil of Names §3.3; L–series §2.10. Status: contested.
5.6 The Sacred Geometry VI — Nine Across Traditions
Plain claim. “Nine” functions as avoidance in Theona and as remaining in Dhahara; neither maps
cleanly to rules.
Notes. Theonan avoidance—unnamed ninth cup/rope (§2.7)—contrasts with Dhaharan practice
(§F) where the ninth is the seat left open, nearer a contemplative “saint” than an angel. Lexicus’s
later fervor (§2.13) should be read as personal heat, not instruction.
Use at the table (optional). If you observe a “ninth,” let it be a pause (a breath), not a mechanic.
No rules change.
Sources. L–series §2.7, §2.13; Dhaharan leaf §F. Status: comparative.
5.7 The Sacred Geometry VII — Ledger Marks & Substitutions
Plain claim. Five symbols recur across houses as a stable quinary: △, rosette ∗, ∥, •, □.
Digit mapping (used in this volume).
Symbol Digit (base–5)
△ 0
∗ 1
∥ 2
• 3
□ 4
Variant house–hands exist but resolve to the same five classes. Use the legend consistently across
puzzles (§4.2, §4.3).
40
Use at the table (optional). When annotating casual games, you may tag turns with a symbol
instead of a word (e.g.,•for “special used”). No rules change.
Sources. Puzzles §4.2, §4.3; ledger leaves §2.3. Status: standardized here.
5.8 The Sacred Geometry VIII — Disputed Fragment: Lexicus
Plain claim. The L–series shows internal consistency, but late leaves (§2.15) are smoke–damaged
and ideologically hot; provenance is mixed.
Notes. Aqyl’s cadence test (“count aloud; copy plainer later”) supports early L–leaves (§2.1,
§2.2). The ecstatic entries around the Ash–Fenn Rite and “The Ninth” (§2.14, §2.15) depart from
that sobriety, and one day–book is explicitly burned. Hand–comparison suggests the same scribe,
overwriting in haste.
Use at the table (optional). Where two fragments disagree on meaning, prefer the cooler hand
for framing mood. No rules change.
Sources. L–series §2.1, §2.2, §2.14, §2.15; Aqyl note §4. Status: disputed, readable.
“Read what you can; hide what you must. The page keeps the order either way.”

E An Aelinnel’s Treatise on Core Mechanics & Meta
Catalog Request Slip (Form 7)
Valvano Bequest — Reading Room Form 7: Request
Call No.: C–Gray 17/LG–Lubick
Title: On the Practical Geometry of Ford Crossing
Author: Lubick of the Lower Gauge
Notes: bright rooms; copy allowed
Circulation: related vigil folios 422 pulls; this tract 9
(pencil at foot) Vigil folios: 422 pulls. Lubick: 9. Numbers, not sighs. —S.H.
Author: Lubick of the Lower Gauge—Aelinnel stock (Vhasian, gnomish). Affiliation: none—“I like
tea, not oaths.” Style: fast. Accuracy: faster.1
Thesis (plain). The core game is a finite, impartial, perfect-information contest on a planar grid-
graph with two piece classes—Blue (mobile, anchorable) and Green (shaping, evasive)—interacting
through lanes, corners, and a 2 ×2 Cross. All meta patterns reduce to three quantities: cut thickness,
tempo parity, and conversion efficiency.
0. Model & Notation (no incense, just math)
Let G= (V,E) be the board graph (orthogonal adjacency). Corners and near-corners are sancta (cf.
taxonomy §5.4). The Cross is the central 2 ×2 block C ⊂V. A lane is a simple path P ⊆V from a
player’s near region to any exit scoring condition (details suppressed; the math survives).
Positions are tuples s = (B,G,σ) with Blue set B ⊆V, Green set G ⊆V, and status σ (whose
bits include which Blues are Rooted, specials availability, etc.). A move is a function f : s →s′
respecting core legality. A plan is a ply sequence p= (f1,...,fk).
Influence fields. Define a discrete potential for each color:
ΦBlue(v) = αmobility(v) + βlaneProx(v)−γfragility(v), ΦGreen(v) = ˆ αescape(v) +
ˆ
βbend(v).
Calibrate (α,β,γ) by post-game audits (see drills below).
1. Cuts, Thickness, & Escapes
A vertex cut S ⊂V separates your build from its exit. Its thickness is |S|, but practical thickness is
Θ(S) = |S|+
1re-enterable in ≤2 plies.
v∈S
Lemma E.1 (Corner insurance). Any cut that includes a true corner (sanctum) has Θ at least
one higher for your opponent if you hold a nearby pivot two steps deep. (Corners resist single-ply
dissolves.)
Meta cue. Strong openings thicken one cut and threaten to migrate the fight to a second; weak
openings thin two cuts and threaten neither.
1If a lemma displeases you, put it under a cup and see if the steam moves it. If it moves, keep it.
47
2. Tempo & Parity (Octaves, not dogma)
Many local races complete in 8 plies under orthodox shapes. Call this an octave loop. The 9th ply is
a naming ply: whoever owns it chooses to cash, refuse, or transpose.
Proposition E.2 (Octave advantage). If a line resolves in exactly 8 plies and you moved first in
that locale, then unless the opponent altered graph structure (special, root), you can force the naming
ply to be yours.
Practical rule. Track local parity per lane: write ⊕if you own the naming ply, ⊖if they do. Shift
fights to regions where you show ⊕; stall where you show ⊖.
3. Rooting as Constraint Programming
A Blue marked Rooted pins a local constraint. Let R⊆B be rooted Blues. Define
free
_capacity=
degG(b).
b∈B\R
Lemma E.3 (Anchor tax). Rooting an enemy Blue reduces their free
_capacity by at least its local
branching factor minus 1. If the rooted Blue sits in C, the tax is larger by the number of forking
lanes through C.
Meta cue. Rooting is strongest where lane density (alternative exits) is high; weakest where you
already thinned cuts (you are taxing a starved graph).
4. Specials as Local Rewrites
Treat each special as a bounded rewrite on Gor σ. Good doctrine: Spend specials to break symmetry
or to lock an ⊕locale into payoff. Bad doctrine: Spend to look clever on ⊖.
Theorem E.4 (Symmetry-break maxim). If a special increases Θ(S) in one region while preserving
it elsewhere, the unique best use is in the region where you already hold ⊕. (Cash the lead, do not
rent it.)
5. Evaluation Function (you may write this on your cuff)
Let
E= w1·Material + w2·Mobility + w3·CutThickness + w4·ParitySum + w5·Conversion,
where
ParitySum =
locales L
+1 ⊕(L)
−1 ⊖(L), Conversion =
threats T
Pr[T →score in ≤3].
Normalize wi by post-hoc regression on your own games (yes, really). If your Esays “+1” but your
cuts say “hollow,” believe the cuts.
6. Openings & Meta Lines (current, sane)
Cage & Pivot. Thicken one rim cut; plant a midboard pivot that threatens both flanks on plies
6–8. Good into fast-lane rushers.
48
Mirror–Then–Shiver. Mirror for four plies, then break symmetry toward your ⊕locale. Punishes
over-mirrors.
Ladder–to–Ladder. Build a rim ladder that stops one short of clinch; transpose the clinch to the
far side when they commit. (Yes, that “one short” is deliberate—see §E.)
7. Endgame Principles (no candles required)
• Two-cut theorem (practical). In stable ends, whoever can thicken two disjoint cuts by +1
wins more than half of tight games, ceteris paribus.
• Zugzwang test. If every legal move in your locale reduces Θ by at least 1, abandon the locale;
build a fresh ⊕elsewhere.
• Corner banking. Bank tempo by keeping a near-corner unsealed until your cross-threat
matures; cash late to avoid giving them a naming ply.
8. Cross Pressure (without taboos)
Holding the Cross is good only if it shortens your lanes or lengthens theirs. Otherwise, it is a tax
upon your own free
_capacity.
Lemma E.5 (Center discipline). If occupying C does not change any shortest-path length by ≥1 in
your favor, vacate within two plies or pivot to a fork. (Write this on your wrist.)
9. A Note on “Remaining” (observational, not doctrinal)
Some players leave one step unspent in profitable lines and seem to win more. I observe this kept
step correlates with owning the naming ply in octave loops (§E). See also cross-tradition notes on
nine (§5.6). I am not in anyone’s circle; I simply counted.
10. Tiny Theorems (carry in pocket)
1. Fork Value. A pivot that threatens two exits with disjoint first steps is worth ≥+1 in Eeven
before conversion.
2. False Thick. A cut that is thick only by pieces already overworked is thin in practice: subtract
1 from Θ.
3. Late Lane Law. If a lane is equal on ply 4 and still equal on ply 6, the player with more ⊕
locales elsewhere will own its naming ply by inertia. Shift now or donate later.
11. Drills (do these; your future self will applaud)
• Cut Audit. Pause at plies 4,8,12; draw your two thickest cuts and mark their Θ. If neither
improves in two checkpoints, your plan is a poem—not a plan.
• Parity Log. Keep a side card of locales with ⊕/⊖. Aim to maintain +2 net by midgame.
• Root Value Sprints. Play ten positions where you can root now or improve a cut; record
which yields higher conversion in ≤3 plies.
49
Closing (sip). The board does not care about your stories; it cares about your cuts, your parity, and
whether your threats convert on time. If someone whispers about thresholds and breath, smile, nod,
and then check whether your shortest path just got shorter. If yes, take it. If not, have tea and
thicken a cut.
50
F New Schools
Theona — “Fairy Stones”
Lore preface. On the eastern isle they leave one seat empty and one turn uncounted. Fishers speak
their nets in eights and set aside a ninth rope as ward. They call the game only Fairy Stones among
strangers, and if pressed for doctrine they change the subject to weather, thresholds, and the duty of
not naming a thing before it has earned its name. Their tables are low; the lanterns are small; the
salt is put away when guests arrive. They will teach by showing you what they didn’t do.
Concordance profile. A restraint school that prices crossings by omission. Theona wins by
offering “almost–exits,” escorting foes through honest lanes, and arriving one breath later with
better measure.
Core premise. Leave the ninth empty. In practice: favor sequences that end on the eighth count
of a local race, compelling the opponent to “name” the crossing first. Theona converts opponent
initiative into priced exits.
Table mood. Quiet pressure; edges kept clean; center touched and released. Announce little; show
much.
Heuristics (testable).
1. Keep one square unclaimed in any local three–move plan; use it as a pivot rather than a
goal.
2. Offer tidy lanes that look free but tax tempo two moves later.
3. Touch the center, don’t sit in it. Create work there; cash it on the rim.
4. Finish on “eight.” If a chase resolves in eight plies, prefer to be the one who declines the
ninth.
Preferred shapes. Narrow diagonals, rim ladders with a deliberate gap, corner–adjacent sancta
that stay potential rather than property.
Openers (themes, not rules).
Empty Chair. Develop toward two edges while leaving an obvious clinch unplayed; invite the
opponent to close it and inherit your prepared counter–lane.
Unpoured Cup. Advance a file to the brink, then mirror on the far side; cross only after the mirror
forces a double–duty defense.
Midgame patterns.
• Near–Ford Escort. Guide an opposing advance across a ford you’ve priced; recoup on the
flank they abandoned.
• Eighth–Beat Switch. Hold a resource until move eight of a local loop, then trade lanes while
the opponent “names” the ninth.
51
Tactics.
• False Sanctum. Present a corner as ripe; your next pushes reveal it as staging, not settlement.
• Soft Denial. Block endings, not paths: let moves pass but forbid staying where it profits
them most.
Counters (vs. Theona).
• Name first—cleanly. Take the “ninth” with a line that doesn’t hand them a priced reply.
• Refuse escorts. If offered a tidy lane, ask what purchase it buys them on the opposite edge
before walking it.
• Break symmetry early. Theona thrives on mirrored patience; asymmetry forces them to
name.
Drills.
1. Eight–Count Scrimmage. Play blitz micro–games where you must not be the player who
completes the ninth tempo in any localized race.
2. Empty–Seat Review. After a game, circle all positions where you could have left one “chair”
open; score how often that would have improved your conversion.
Use with Rites (optional, cosmetic). Veil of Names (§3.3) complements the style’s quiet; Candle
Count (§3.4) makes the “eighth–beat” decisions visible without changing a rule. Leave both OFF for
tournament play.
“Leave one cup poured and unclaimed; leave one chair waiting. The board will tell you which
guest has arrived.”
— Theonan fishers’ saying
The Witness — “The Remaining Compact”
Lore preface. They say the circle that calls itself the Witness keeps three small vows and two large
courtesies. The vows are salt, copper, and silence: bind the edge, price the crossing, name nothing
until it earns the name. The courtesies are to the eighth and the ninth: work to the eighth, then
leave one thing unclosed so the room can answer. Their numbers are not spells; they are habits with
a taste for thresholds.
Concordance profile. A threshold school that taxes crossings and converts pressure into measured
exits. The Witness wins by staging “priced invitations,” sealing on tempo rather than on spectacle.
Core premise. Price first, cross later. Make each opponent advance carry a delayed cost; step
through only when your ledger is favorable.
Table mood. Clinical calm. The board feels bound at the rim, breathable in the middle, and
suspicious of free lunches.
Sacred counts (as heuristics, not rules).
52
3 — Proof. Before you take a crossing, demand three proofs: (i) you gain a lane, (ii) you deny an
answer, (iii) you keep a recourse.
5 — Candles. Evaluate local fights in five-beat phrases; prefer lines that “light” two of the public
triggers while conceding at most one.
8 — Work. Resolve races by the eighth ply; if resolution slips to the ninth, make it their hand that
names it.
9 — Remaining. Leave one square, line, or capture deliberately unclaimed. That absence is
leverage, not loss.
Heuristics (testable).
1. Bind the rim first. Secure a perimeter file that makes enemy edge-walks inefficient; cash in
later.
2. Tax the ford. Whenever the center is touched, ensure a follow-up that turns their stay into
a tempo leak.
3. Hold a sealed reply. Enter a line only with a quiet counter in pocket—one that flips valuation
without noise.
4. Prefer delayed value. Choose sequences that look equal on move 4 but show surplus on
move 6–8.
Preferred shapes. Quincunx scaffolds; triads that point at a rim crack; ladder lanes that stop one
square short (the “kept step”).
Openers (themes, not rules).
Copper Ledger. Offer a clean lane; spend tempo elsewhere so that accepting your “gift” walks into
a ready denial.
Salt Ring. Develop two files inward, keeping the outermost squares unattractive; trade edges late
when your center refusal has priced their options.
Midgame patterns.
• Crack & Seal. Invite a short-term breach you can close one ply later, turning their entry
into anchorage for your exit.
• Ford Titration. Touch the center briefly to force an answer, then vacate and score on the
flank they under-defended.
Tactics.
• Priced Invitation. Present an apparently winning capture or lane whose aftermath loses a
tempo or shape.
• Silent Exchange. Trade equal material for superior turns; prefer quiet gains over flashy
nets.
53
Counters (vs. the Witness).
• Name early. Commit to a clean, forcing line that denies them the “kept ninth.”
• Over-pay nothing. If a lane looks free, count two moves deeper; refuse if the ledger turns.
• Pull to open water. Spread the fight; they prefer priced corridors to broad fronts.
Drills.
1. Three-Proof Test. For ten sample crossings, write the three proofs; only play those that pass
all three.
2. Eighth-Beat Audit. Review finished games; mark races that resolved on move 9+. Reconstruct
how to compel resolution on 8.
Use with Rites (optional, cosmetic). Candle Count (§3.4) spotlights your five-beat evaluations;
Salt Stitch (§3.1) sharpens rim-binding aesthetics. Leave both OFF for tournament integrity.
“Bind the edge, price the water, keep one step unspent. The board remembers who pays and who
witnesses.”

Provenance: a short Dhaharan folio, margin–stamped for a winter observance; translated with light
normalization. The original script is calm and spacious, with long breaths between clauses.
We are not as the Ykrul counters nor the Kuvani whisperers who fear the last place and speak
around it. We do not goad it nor bargain with it. We make room.
At dusk we sweep the threshold and lay a narrow ring of salt where feet remember to step. We
wash the hands in water that has touched a word. We set three lanterns, then three, then three,
and leave one unlit. We do not explain ourselves.
We kindle incense until the air remembers a road. We say the small verses that do not ask. We
count the breaths as if listening for a guest.
We drink the mild wine and sit with stones and board until the lamps lean. We do not wager
coin; we practice keeping. We speak little. When laughter comes, we do not chase it away.
In the deep hour we pour a ninth cup and leave it where morning will find it. This is the seat
the Messenger yielded when it stooped to be our measure of play; some call that yielding a fall,
others a mercy. We call it the remaining.
The ring of salt is not a wall; it is a way to notice the edge. The unlit flame is not refusal; it is
a place kept open so breath may turn.
When light returns, we unmake what we made. We scatter a pinch of salt to the four roads. We
lift the unlit lantern and let the day choose it. We do not declare that we have learned; we look
again, and something that would not come forward before stands a little nearer, like a page held
at a kinder angle.
If there is a ninth, it is not a captain and not a judge. It abides. It is the rest between measures,
the seat left empty so the room can breathe. Honor it, and let play teach the rest.
Translator’s note. The Dhaharan term rendered “the remaining” admits readings as “what abides”
and “what stays available.” The folio hints (without disputation) that the “Messenger” left its place
to lie flat as play. The leaf commands nothing; it suggests a practice. The board appears as craft,
not dogma.
Epilogue — A Letter from Alayse

Seal: common wax
Elyas,
I grow most concerned for Markus of late. I know he loves me and our daughter, yet his soft smile
so seldom reaches his eyes. I jest that his years in Thepyrgos scorched his skin and his gaze. I know
the truth of it; his Ecktorian blood is truer than his brothers’ and he darkens with age. He laughs
and calls me a silly thing... and yet.
And yet I find him often in the yard, staring. Our Ykrul champion says he prays to the eight winds,
but Markus always faces south, even when the breeze comes down from the north. Perhaps he misses
the warm kiss of the southern air. Sometimes he will stand until the eighth bell and only then
come in, as if keeping a small appointment with the hush. Perhaps it is only that he worries after

Lerris—still enrolled at the University these twelve, nearly thirteen, years. The stacks keep what
they keep.
It troubles me—but he is my love; nought shall change that.
Alahana is well. She grows taller day by day and oft asks after her “Summer Uncle.”
Be well on your travels, little brother. I think of you often.
Alayse, 889 AR
