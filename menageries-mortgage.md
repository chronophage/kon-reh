# The Menagerie's Mortgage
*A Fate's Edge Adventure Homage to Classic D&D*

## Premise
Maelstraeus, the Infernal Bargainer, has contracted the party to serve legal summons on Zara the Magnificent, owner of the Celestial Menagerie - a safari-style theme park made of pocket dimensions housing exotic creatures. Zara has defaulted on her infernal mortgage and refuses to be served, fleeing into her own park where the "attractions" include creatures from across the planes.

## Core Hook
**"The contract says we have to serve her personally. Doesn't say anything about when, where, or how many teeth she has."**

## Adventure Structure
Instead of 30 floors of penance, 12 "Enclosures" of escalating chaos, each themed around classic D&D monster types but with Fate's Edge's narrative-first approach.

---

## The Contract (Starting Situation)
Players receive a magical contract from Maelstraeus that:
- Burns if torn
- Screams if ignored  
- Glows brighter the closer they get to Zara
- Has fine print that's literally microscopic (requiring Arcana DV 3 to read)

**Stakes:** If they don't serve the summons within 7 days, they owe Maelstraeus a favor. If they serve it successfully, Zara owes THEM a favor (she's that kind of lawful evil).

## Mechanical Innovations

### **Attraction Tickets System**
Players can earn "tickets" by:
- Successfully completing encounters
- Creative problem-solving  
- Roleplaying monster interactions
- Avoiding violence when possible

**Tickets can be spent to:**
- Skip one enclosure entirely
- Gain advantage on one roll per enclosure
- Buy information from Maelstraeus (1 ticket = one clue about Zara's location)
- Escape from a Desperate situation (1 ticket = improve Position by one step)

### **Exhibit Condition Tracker**
Each enclosure has a "Maintenance" clock [4-6]:
- Filled by SB spends and player actions
- When full: Exhibit becomes more dangerous but also more rewarding
- Players can choose to "repair" exhibits for different benefits

### **Zara's Escalation Clock [8]**
Tracks how close Zara is to escaping the park entirely:
- Advances when players cause chaos or fail to contain creatures
- When full: Zara escapes, party fails mission
- Players can slow it by containing escaped creatures from other exhibits

## Patron Integration (Maelstraeus)

### **Favor Track Benefits:**
- **Favor 0:** Contract Guidance - Once per session, ask GM about contract interpretation
- **Favor 1:** Infernal Insight - Gain +1d when detecting lies or deception
- **Favor 2:** Bargaining Chip - Once per session, introduce a previously hidden contractual clause
- **Favor 3:** Devil's Advocate - Convert one SB spend into a beneficial twist instead
- **Favor 4:** Hellbound - Once per arc, summon a minor devil to aid in negotiations
- **Favor 5:** Master of Contracts - Automatically succeed on one social roll involving legal/contractual matters

### **Taboos:**
- Breaking your word once given
- Destroying valuable infernal artifacts without permission
- Helping Zara escape (unless part of a counter-bargain)

## Why This Works As "Fun Dungeon"

1. **Classic Monster Love:** All the beloved D&D creatures, but with narrative purpose
2. **Multiple Paths:** Violence, social, stealth, and creative solutions all viable
3. **Escalating Rewards:** Riskier approaches offer bigger payoffs
4. **Player Agency:** Choices have clear, immediate consequences
5. **Humor Integration:** Classic D&D absurdity (owlbears, mimics) with mechanical weight
6. **Modular Design:** Can run 3-4 enclosures as one-shot, full 12 as campaign
7. **Mechanical Innovation:** Ticket economy provides resource management without bookkeeping
8. **Thematic Consistency:** All elements tie back to "bargaining" and "contracts"

The key is that every classic monster encounter has a Fate's Edge mechanical hook that makes player choices matter - whether they're negotiating with goblins, outsmarting mimics, or appealing to a corrupted dragon's better nature.
